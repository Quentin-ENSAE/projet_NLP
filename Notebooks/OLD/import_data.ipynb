The patient denied presence of fever, nausea, and weight loss. There were no significant findings at physical examination. An abdominal ultrasound exam revealed a 10.4 x 10.0 cm mass of heterogeneous echogenicity in the left upper abdomen. Axial unenhanced CT scan (Fig. 1a) confirmed an ill-defined heterogeneous mass 9.1 cm in diameter that filled the left abdominal quadrant, located between the left lobe of the liver and the spleen. The CT attenuation of the mass was around 26-53 HU on non-enhanced scan. After intravenous contrast medium injection the mass enhanced gradually and heterogeneously (Fig. 1b-e), but was still hypodense relative to the spleen. There was no accompanying lymphadenopathy or evidence of malignant process elsewhere in the abdomen. Because the origin of the mass was unknown and a primary malignancy could not be excluded, the patient underwent an explorative laparotomy. During the operation, a well-encapsulated mass was found under the left hepatic lobe and the pedicle arising from the spleen. Resection of the mass and the spleen was performed.  \\nGross examination of the spleen showed splenomegaly (580 g, 15 x 10 x 9 cm) with an ill-defined brownish nodule (5 x 8 x 8 cm). Histologic examination (Fig. 2) revealed that the lesion was composed of variably sized vascular channels lined with flat and tall endothelial cells, with papillary fronds extending into the vascular channels. No atypical cells or mitosis were present. The endothelial lining cells of the vascular channels were positive for CD31 and CD68, factor VIII and negative for CD34, CD21, and CD8. These findings were considered diagnostic of benign splenic littoral cell angioma.',\n",

Best corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in both eyes. Pupils were equal and without afferent pupillary defect (APD). Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg and 10 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. Confrontation visual fields revealed an inferonasal depression in the right eye. Slit lamp biomicroscopy showed iris neovascularization of both eyes (Figure 1 (Fig. 1)). Dilated fundus examination showed unremarkable optic nerves, attenuated arteries, and dilated, non-tortuous veins in both eyes with few drusen in the right macula and very few hemorrhages. Optical coherence tomography showed no evidence of macular edema (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)). \\nFluorescein angiography exhibited delayed arterial filling and poor peripheral perfusion (Figure 3 (Fig. 3)). Right temporal artery biopsy was negative for giant cell arteritis. We ruled out hyperviscosity syndromes, blood dyscrasia, diabetes, Takayasu, collagen vascular disease, thyroid orbitopathy and various infectious causes of retinal ischemia and aortitis. CBC, SPEP, HbA1c, ESR, CRP, FTA-ABS, and hypercoagulation panel were unremarkable. Carotid duplex ultrasound indicated only mild carotid stenosis (1-39%) bilaterally. At the time of initial presentation, the patient was taking Lipitor, Aspirin 81 mg, Relafen, Klonopin, Zoloft, and Nexium. \\nThe patient received pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) in the right eye. Due to low tolerance, a retrobulbar block without epinephrine was administered to the right eye prior to the second PRP ten days later at which time 3,625 spots with a duration of 20 milliseconds of 500 mW were delivered using the indirect laser ophthalmoscope. Eighteen days after this laser session visual acuity had dropped significantly in the right eye to count fingers at 3' with APD and attenuated posterior vasculature consistent with central retinal artery occlusion. MRA Extracranial showed proximal occlusion of aortic arch branches (Figure 4 (Fig. 4)). Due to concern for diminished blood supply from the aortic arch, the patient received a left subclavian artery to right common carotid artery bypass graft. One month after surgery, neovascular glaucoma developed in the right eye with intraocular pressure of 34 mmHg and 22 mmHg in the left eye. Pressures remained stable on Combigan twice daily. We treated the left eye with short sessions of laser for a total of 2,200 burns (0.05-0.07 sec, 300 micron) using the Laser indirect system for one session and the Varia multicolor slit-lamp system for the remaining 5 sessions. Six months after the bypass surgery, she maintained a visual acuity of 20/50 in the left eye and intraocular pressure was 18 mmHg.\",\n",

In the imaging test of full body, chest X-ray and chest CT revealed a large lung mass, extending to posterior chest wall and vertebral body, surrounded by lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the right lower lung as well as multiple lymphadenopathy and right pleural effusion (Fig. 1a, b). Bronchoscopic biopsy of the tumor lead to a diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1a, stage IV) harboring the EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation. No other molecular analysis was performed. The patient was started on gefitinib at 250 mg/day for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. However, by 28 days after the start of gefitinib therapy, his symptoms further deteriorated along with the increased tumor size, resulting in PS 3 (Fig. 2a, b).\\nThen, repeat biopsy was performed from the lung tumor. First, in addition to the preserved EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation, EGFR T790M mutation was analyzed, resulting in negative status. Second, as a possible molecular alteration next to EGFR T790M mutation, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for MET amplification was analyzed, resulting in positive status (mean MET per cell = 6.7, MET/CEP7 [centromeric enumeration probe for chromosome 7] ratio = 2.5). At this point, cytotoxic chemotherapy was not a candidate for treatment due to his poor PS. Furthermore, although crizotinib was known as potential MET inhibitor as well as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, combination therapy with crizotinib and EGFR-TKI was considered to lack the evidences about safety. Therefore, combination therapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib was selected on the basis of the potential efficacy for activated MET signaling pathway as well as the confirmed safety by the JO25567 phase II clinical trial.\\nThe patient was started on erlotinib at 150 mg/day plus bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. By 21 days after the start of this combination therapy, his symptoms gradually improved along with the decreased tumor size, resulting in better PS with no severe toxicities (Fig. 3a, b). However, after 2 cycles of bevacizumab administration, he unfortunately fractured his face from falling down during the rehabilitation to improve the deteriorated activity of daily life (ADL). Then, he underwent open reduction and fixation of his face fracture under general anesthesia. Eventually, he was forced to quit this promising combination therapy.',\n",

He denied polydipsia, polyuria, sexual hypoactivity, or any symptoms of unconsciousness, epilepsy, convulsion, and cognitive disorders. Physical examinations revealed that his right visual acuity was 0.5 and the left was 0.4. Goldmann perimetry revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. He was found to have ptosis of the right eyelid. The right pupillary reaction to light was absent. Other neurological examination results were normal. His past history was negative for head trauma. His social and family history and his system review were negative.\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an abnormal mixed signal mass with suprasellar, parasellar, and suprasellar invasiveness in the sellar area (Fig. 1A-C). The lesion was about 2.8 x 1.9 x 1.9 cm, inside which was some spotty necrosis. A dynamic contrast-enhanced scan showed heterogeneous enhancement. Relatively normal pituitary tissue with normal enhancement could be seen near the inferior lesion margin, but was squashed. The optic chiasma was mildly compressed but the basic shape was generally normal. The bilateral internal carotid arteries were also partly wrapped. Laboratory tests used to explore pituitary disorders showed normal levels of pituitary hormones, including prolactin (N < 20 mug/L), luteinizing hormone (LH) (N > 10 IU/L), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (N > 20 IU/L), thyrotropin, and corticotropin. The diagnosis of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma was suspected.\\nVia a trans-nasal-sphenoidal approach, a surgical exploration was performed. After drilling the sellar floor and opening the dura, a firm, tough, wheaten mass was found. As its consistency was too elastic and hypervascular to be easily cut by a surgical blade, and it adhered so tightly to the cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery, only subtotal resection was ultimately achieved. Repair of the sellar defect was done with autologous fat and fascia lata. The immediate postoperative sellar MRI was not performed. In a surprise twist, postsurgical hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained sections showed that the lesion contains epithelioid and spindled cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in sheets and nests. Mild-to-moderate nuclear atypia could also be observed. On immunohistochemical evaluation, the tumor cells were positive for Vimentin, CD68, CD34, Nestin, GFAP, Desmin, SMA, AE1/AE3, and S-100 protein, but were negative for NSE, Synuclein, NeuN, EMA, pituitary hormones (LH, FSH, ACTH, TSH, growth hormone, and prolactin), synaptophysin and chromogranin. Ki-67 proliferation index was 6% (Fig. 2A-K). The pathological test supported the diagnosis of adenohypophysis spindle-cell oncocytoma. The postsurgical course was uneventful and his clinical symptoms of headache and diplopia were markedly improved.\\nHowever, 1 month after the surgery, the patient's vision declined sharply and meanwhile he complained of severe ophthalmodynia of the right eye. The sellar MRI revealed that the tumor recurred (Fig. 1D and E) and the patient underwent a gamma-knife treatment. But the symptoms were not relieved significantly. Three months later, the sellar MRI showed the lesion was approximately 2.8 x 2.2 x 3.1 cm with equal T1 signal and inhomogeneous long T2 signal, which were enhanced with mass or nodosity after contrast administration. The suprasellar region, bilateral cavernous sinuses, and optic chiasma were further invaded. Necrosis, cyst degeneration, and hemorrhage within the tumor could be detected (Fig. 1F-H). A secondary surgery was performed through the left pterional approach. The tumor's texture was firm to elastic and the bleeding was heavy; therefore, we just performed a partial resection, decompressed the optic nerves and chiasm. The sellar MRI after 1 week of the secondary surgery was shown as Fig. 1I to K. Postsurgically, transient central diabetes-insipidus persisted for 2 weeks. Visual field and acuity remained unimproved. Histological evaluation revealed similar morphology and immunohistochemical profiles to the previous specimen. The Ki-67 index for this time increased to 19%. From the perspectives of pathologists, the pathological grade was considered WHO III.\\nOne month after the secondary surgery, the patient came to PUMCH again complaining almost blindness and severe headache. A sellar MRI was arranged, demonstrating that the tumor recurred again to approximately 4.9 x 3.6 x 3.1 cm with necrosis, cyst degeneration, and hemorrhage. The enhancement was inhomogeneous and the surrounding structures and tissues were further invaded (Fig. 1L-P). The third surgery via a transsphenoidal approach was conducted for decompressing. Partial resection was achieved and the visual disturbance and headache were alleviated a lot. Pathological evaluation results were similar to previous, confirming the diagnosis of ASCO. And the Ki-67 proliferation index increased to 45% (WHO III-IV grade, Fig. 2L), highly suggesting its malignancy. The patient has already been followed up for nearly half a year and reported no recurrence of headache and visual deterioration. His right visual acuity was 0.4 and the left was 0.3, evaluated recently.\",\n",

A provisional diagnosis of mucocele was made; the lesion was excised under local anesthesia. Histopathological examination of the excised tissue revealed cystic lumen devoid of lining epithelium and surrounded by compressed granulation tissue and peripherally located mixed salivary glands. The lumen was filled with numerous mucinous globular structures which were oval or round in shape and of varying sizes [Figure 2]. Most of the globules present in the cystic lumen were attached to the surrounding cystic capsule and seemed dissociated from one another because of their globular organization. Some of the globules were suspended freely within the lumen [Figure 3]. Individual globules exhibited a mildly cellular core with peripheral laminations of dystrophic calcifications [Figure 4]. The granulation tissue forming the cystic wall was highly cellular, consisting of chronic inflammatory cells.

The patient had no remarkable medical or family histories. On vaginal examination, the uterus was enlarged, non-tender, smooth and movable. Vaginal ultrasonogram and magnetic resonance imaging showed a polypoid mass of 14 x 10 cm in size in the uterus, possibly representing a carcinosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. No free pelvic fluid was identified. Computed tomography (CT) showed the liver and bile ducts to be normal. The endometrial Pap smear was evaluated as positive. Biopsies of the endometrium were carried out and the histological diagnosis revealed carcinosarcoma. The serum AFP level was 10,131 ng/ml (normal <20). Other tumor markers and liver function test results were within normal limits. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.\\nThe resected enlarged uterus, weighing 560 g and measuring 14 x 12 x 7 cm, had a smooth glistening surface. The polypoid tumor originated from the uterine cavity when the anterior wall of the uterus was opened. The uterine adnexae were normal in shape and size. There was no evidence of a tumorous lesion. Microscopic examination showed that the polypoid tumor was a mixture of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components (fig. 1a). The tumor had invaded the uterine cervix, but no metastases were found in the dissected lymph nodes. The carcinomatous component showed adenocarcinoma arranged in sheets and cords with a hepatoid appearance. Reactivity for AFP was cytoplasmic in the hepatoid carcinoma lesion (fig. 1b). The sarcomatous component showed no reactivity for AFP. The large pleomorphic cells were positive for desmin, actin, CD10, MyoD1, and myoglobin and could be regarded as being rhabdomyosarcoma. There was no staining with S-100. In summary, the tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as heterologous uterine corpus carcinosarcoma associated with AFP-producing hepatoid adenocarcinoma.\\nPostoperatively, the patient received six courses of chemotherapy with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 5).

She had undergone surgery due to breast cancer at the age of 68. On pelvic examination, enlarged uterus without a palpable adnexal mass was detected. The vaginal wall showed no abnormalities. Portio vaginalis could not be detected, so the endometrial Pap smear could not be done. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhanced mass, 8 cm in size, in the uterine corpus cavity, possibly representing malignant tumor. CT scan demonstrated ascites and no lymph nodes were detected. CT and ultrasonography revealed no abnormalities in the liver or bile duct. The serum AFP level was elevated (401 ng/ml), but no elevation of other markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen or carbohydrate antigen 125, was observed. The blood count and serum biochemical data were unremarkable. From these results, malignant uterine tumor was highly suspected. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic washings was carried out. The resected uterus was enlarged and filled with a spongy material. There was no apparent extrauterine extension of the tumor. A partially necrotic polyp, 8 cm in size, was present within the endometrial cavity, which infiltrated into the myometrium for about two-thirds of its thickness but did not invade the cervix. Cytology of the pelvic washings was negative. Histologically, the tumor was composed of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components (fig. 2a). The carcinomatous component was an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with trabecular hepatoid cells, mostly showing hepatocellular carcinoma-like proliferation. Immunohistochemistry also revealed AFP-positivity in many tumor cells (fig. 2b).\\nThe sarcomatous component showed rhabdoid features including spindle-shaped tumor cells. Occasional cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and cytoplasmic cross-striations were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed focal positivity of tumor cells with desmin, MyoD1, and CD10. On pathologic examination, the tumor was interpreted as being a heterologous uterine corpus carcinosarcoma associated with AFP-producing hepatoid adenocarcinoma.\\nWe did not carry out any adjuvant chemotherapy or irradiation because of the patient's advanced age, in addition, she and her family refused these therapies.

Twenty of the 34 MM patients were females and 14 were males, the median age was 73,2 years (range 64.6-80.3) and the median time from diagnosis of MM to the first treatment with daratumumab was 37 months (range 235-3). Cytogenetic characteristics were obtained from only 7 patients, of these only one was unfavorable. Each patient received one line of therapy and 6 (14,7%) patients received two lines or more. All 34 RRMM patients received a previous bortezomib-based therapy in which bortezomib was given with dexamethasone alone (3 cases) or combined with melphalan (16 cases) or with thalidomide (15 cases). In addition, 4 patients received lenalidomide, 3 patients received pomalidomide and 1 patient received Carfilzomib. Before DRd, seven patients (20,6%) underwent to a prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), that it is consisted in a single ASCT in 5 patients and in a double ASCT in the other 2 cases.\\nSixteen patients (47%) presented one or more comorbidities: cardiovascular diseases (11), solid tumors (4), metabolic disorders (3), other hematological disorders (2), rheumatological diseases (1), pulmonary diseases (1), neurological diseases (1) and gastrointestinal diseases (1).\\nTwelve patients (36%) were refractory to the previous therapy. Eight patients (23,5%) presented with anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl), 3 (8,8%) with chronic kidney disease (creatinine > 2 mg/dl), 19 (55,9%) with bone lesions, while none of the patients presented with hypercalcemia (Ca2+ > 11 mg/dl). Among the 34 patients, 18 (53%) had a monoclonal component (CM) > 2 g/dl and 18 patients (53%) had a Bence-Jones proteinuria.\\nAll RRMM patients received daratumumab IV at the standard dose of 16 mg/kg whereas in 30 (88,3%) patients it was combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) and in the remaining 4 cases (11,7%) with bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd). A median number of 8 cycles (range 1-32) was administered within a median follow-up of 16 months (range 1-35). Among DRd treated patients, the lenalidomide starting dose was reduced in 12 patients (35%) according to the renal function or due to neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. At the time of analysis, 25 (73,5%) patients were currently receiving treatment. Nine patients (26,5%) discontinued treatment for progressive disease (8 patients) and intolerance (1 case).\\nPatients who received at least two doses of daratumumab-based triplets were included in the statistical analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator.\\nThe overall response rate (ORR) was 88%. A Complete Response (CR) occurred in 12% of cases, a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) in 44%, and a Partial Response (PR) in 32%. The Median time to achieve at least a PR was 40 days (range 30-110 days). Progressive disease was observed in 8 patients (23,5%), in which 5 cases (14,7%) led to death. Twenty-six patients (76,4%) were responding to treatment at the time of analysis.\\nMoreover, 4 transplant-eligible patients, however refractory to the VTD scheme after a median of 6 cycles of daratumumab, deepened their response, allowed themselves to receive an ASCT, and then continued DRD therapy. One of these four patients progressed and died within 100 days after the transplant.\\nAdverse events are summarized in Table 2. The most common hematological toxicities of any grade were neutropenia (15 patients; 44%), managed with lenalidomide dose reduction, and thrombocytopenia (10 patients; 29%). Other common non-hematological toxicities of grade 1 involved 10 patients (29%), including asthenia, light-headedness and breathlessness, edema of lower extremities, intestinal intolerance with diarrheal episodes, and epigastralgia. Two patients (5,4%) presented pulmonary AEs, one case with pneumonia and the other case with a chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) exacerbation. The only grade 4 AE case was observed at the beginning of the third cycle and consisted of intolerance with persistent gastrointestinal disorders that required patient hospitalization leading to a discontinuation of the therapy.\\nAfter an extensive oral premedication of our patients consisting of cetirizine dihydrochloride 10 mg, montelukast 10 mg, paracetamol 1000 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg that was administered once/daily from the day before to the day after the infusion, we observed a DARA infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in only 3 patients (8,8%). All IRRs were a grade 1 - 2 and occurred during the first infusion, with urticaria, tachycardia, and respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm and dyspnea.\\nAt a median follow-up of 16 months (range 35 - 1), the median PFS and OS have not been reached (NR); the 12-month PFS and OS rates were 78% and 86,5%, respectively (Fig. 1. A and B). In the univariate analysis, the achievement of at least a VGPR, receiving just one line of previous therapy and the male gender resulted in a statistically significant better PFS (Fig. 1. C, D, and E), whereas the absence of anemia at the start of the daratumumab-based triplets and the achievement of at least a VGPR predicted a better OS (Fig. 1. F and G).\\nIn the multivariate analysis, only the achievement of at least a VGPR resulted as an independent predictor of prolonged PFS, showing an HR of 0.037 (95% CI of 0.0001-0.988; p= .049). Interestingly, other potential predictors of unfavorable prognoses, such as the condition of early or late relapse, did not impact patients' clinical outcomes after DRd.\\nIn the present series, 4 patients received DVd because they were previously exposed to lenalidomide. Compared to the DRd treated patients, they showed a worse PFS and a similar OS. Once again, the small number of cases did not allow conclusions to be drawn concerning this issue. Apart from the daratumumab triplet used, many other factors may have contributed to the worse outcome of these four patients, as for example, the fact that they all had received more than one line of previous therapies.\",\n",

His parents had a history of sore throat and cough for several days during the Omicron epidemic, but they didn't test for SARS-CoV-2. After admission to our NICU, he was febrile at 38.3 C with a respiratory rate of 52 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95%-99% while breathing ambient air. His examination was remarkable for congested nares, clear rhinorrhea, and mild subcostal retractions. There were coarse breath sounds in all lung fields. No murmur of the heart could be heard. The liver was palpated at 1 cm-2 cm under the costal margin (consistent with age), and the spleen was not palpated. Laboratory data revealed that the total WBC count and the proportions of the major leukocyte subsets in peripheral blood were normal. Blood gas, C reactive protein (CRP), and transaminase levels were in the normal range. RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 from a throat swab was positive. Then, the baby was given physical cooling and nasal secretion removal to keep the airway clear (see Table 1).\\nThe baby presented febrile once daily in the following four days, and the peak temperature decreased from 38.4 to 38 C. Meanwhile, he developed a cough and sputum, along with a dropping of SpO2 to 80% when feeding. His lung demonstrated scattered crackles (see Figure 1). Because of continuous fever and pneumonia, more investigations were performed. The total WBC count and the proportions of the major leukocyte subsets were still in the normal range. CRP was 4.3 mg/L (0-10 mg/L). Anemia was noticed: RBC was 2.73 x 1,012/L, hemoglobin was 91.0 g/L, and hematocrit was 27.4%. Alanine transaminase (ALT) was 88 U/L(<=41 U/L), aspartate transaminase (AST) was 180 IU/L(<=40 U/L), and glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT) was 109 U/L(6-42 U/L). Further, pathogens tests identified that parainfluenza virus RNA was positive, but there was no evidence of infection for other pathogens such as RSV, EBV, TORCH, ECHO virus, Coxsackie virus (CA16/CVB), influenza A/B/H1N1/H3N2, adenovirus, mycoplasma, chlamydia, HIV, Human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and hepatitis B/C virus. Ultrasonography for the heart and abdomen was normal. Therefore, the baby was given the nebulization treatment of budesonide and ipratropium bromide solution and given Glutathione for hepatoprotection. In addition, he inhaled oxygen intermittently to avoid hypoxia when feeding.\\nOn the 7th day after admission, the patient was no longer febrile but was still coughing and had nasal congestion. On the 10th day, respiratory symptoms improved greatly, and we re-tested the liver function after 5 days of hepatoprotective treatment. The transaminase level elevated markedly. ALT was up to 645 U/L(<=41 U/L), AST increased to 480 IU/L(<=40 U/L), and gamma-GT was 491 U/L(6-42 U/L). However, bilirubin, blood ammonia, blood glucose, lipids, lactate, coagulation function, and albumin levels were within the normal range. The patient's perinatal medical history and family history were tracked carefully, and the possibility of inherited metabolic liver disease was ruled out. Furthermore, the patient's history of drug exposure before/after admission was also reviewed, and there was no evidence of drug-induced liver injury. So, virus infection may contribute to liver injury and the elevation of transaminase levels. When the immune system clears the virus, the injury should be alleviated. Thus, we only administered glycyrrhizin and bicyclol to promote recovery.\\nOn the 14th day, the baby looked well with the normal physical examination. Laboratory tests demonstrated that ALT decreased to 125 U/L(<=41 U/L), AST was 44 IU/L(<=40 U/L), and gamma-GT was 283 U/L(6-42 U/L). He continued to take glycyrrhizin and bicyclol after being discharged home. The liver transaminase level returned to normal on 8 and 15 days after discharge (see Table 2 and Figure 2).\",\n",

Gloria had separated from him shortly before his death, the reason being that she was no longer able to tolerate physical closeness.

She was frightened of not being able to be in control of her symptoms and the prospect of becoming dependent on the pain medication prescribed to combat her severe headaches.\\n was a prominent psychoanalyst to use ethological concepts to describe the infant\\'s biologically predisposed attachment to a primary caregiver. He viewed relatedness in early childhood as a primary and independent developmental goal that is not subservient to a physiological needs (e.g., hunger) or psychoanalytically defined primary processes. The infant is perceived from an interactional perspective, with a focus on the relationships with primary attachment figures. Attachment theory maintained some foundations of psychoanalytic theory (e.g., the developmental point of view) and there is a strong literature that discusses the divergences and convergences of psychoanalysis and attachment theory (e.g.,) and also developed some aspects further, particularly the delineation of the internal world.) overview of the intersection of these two approaches demonstrated that the relationship between attachment theory and psychoanalysis is more complex than adherents of either community have generally recognized. This paper addresses some of these complexities by integrating attachment assessment using the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) in psychodynamic psychotherapy in an adult traumatized patient.\\n proposed that one major difference between psychoanalysis and attachment theory falls in the description of forms of defensive processes. Traditional psychoanalytic models provide a complex constellation of defenses to interpret a broad range of intrapsychic phenomenon, including phantasy, dream, wish, and impulse (e.g.,). Attachment theory delineates two basic processes that manifest in three forms. According to), Bowlby defined defense as forms exclusion directed to modulating difficult and anxious experiences with attachment figures, and the child\\'s experiences with incomplete or failed bids for parental protection, care, and comfort. He defined defenses in terms of two qualitatively distinct processes: deactivation (retaining elements of intellectualization and denial) and cognitive disconnection (retaining elements of splitting).) pointed out that under normal circumstances these two exclusion processes are associated with goals to maintain physical and psychological proximity in the attachment-caregiving relationship under conditions when the child\\'s experiences with the attachment figure are less than satisfying. George and Solomon refined model suggesting that deactivation and cognitive disconnection organized and supported at least minimal forms of representational, behavioral, and emotional regulation. proposed that these forms defensive exclusion functioned to segregate (akin to repression) memory, affect, and experience when the attachment figure was not available, conceiving of an extreme process he termed \"segregated systems.\" Segregated systems were thought as associated with the painful and chronic distress experiences, such as those that accompany loss. Bowlby posited that segregated systems were the intrapsychic root of symptoms related pathological mourning and severe psychopathology. Attachment theorists have since demonstrated that segregated systems are associated with experiences of failed protection, attachment trauma, and disorganized/dysregulated attachment behavior and representation.\\nConsistent with a psychoanalytic approach, some attachment theorists have suggested that utilization of defensive process models is needed to provide a complete picture of the emotional and behavioral regulation processes individuals develop from their childhood relationships with attachment figures. Further, concluded, \"In order to understand the relationship between adult attachment and mental health risk we need to examine the attachment concepts of defense and segregated systems, the mental processes that define disorganization\" (p. 295). These theorists operationally defined basic defense scheme as a central element for evaluating representational patterns of attachment using the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System. Suggesting that these representational structures have developed under conditions of attachment trauma (abuse, loss, failed protection), the concept of segregated systems is fruitful to explain some forms of relationship-based psychopathology in adults.\\nThe discussion that follows provides some ideas about using attachment concepts in clinical work by showing how the perspectives of a psychoanalyst and attachment assessment may improve the understanding of an individual case of a traumatized patient with the diagnosis of a PTSD with dissociative states (e.g., fainting in response to stressful situations).\\nThe lifetime prevalence of PTSD in Germany has been found to be 1.3% with a female-to-male ratio of 3.25-1. Traumatized patients are frequently misdiagnosed and mistreated in the mental health system. The number and complexity of the symptoms lead to fragmented and incomplete treatment. PTSD patients are vulnerable to become re-victimized by caregivers because of their difficulties with close relationships. Severely traumatized PTSD patients (complex trauma) develop difficulties in modulating arousal and show signs of severe affect dysregulation (e.g., aggression against self and other, and problems with social attachment and dissociative states).\\nDissociation, defined as a deficit of the integrative functions of memory, consciousness and identity, is often related to traumatic experiences and traumatic memories. During clinical interviews, dissociation is suggested either by such a degree of unwitting absorption in mental states that ordinary attention to the outside environment is seriously hampered. Dissociation can be accompanied by a sudden lack of continuity in discourse, thought or behavior of which the person is unaware (supposedly due to intrusion of dissociated mental contents in the flow of consciousness). Thus, for instance, a dissociative patient may suddenly interrupt her speech during a therapeutic session, stare into the void for minutes, and become unresponsive to the therapist\\'s queries as to what is happening to her. Or a patient suffering from PTSD may suddenly utter fragmented and incoherent comments on intrusive mental images (usually related to traumatic memories) that surface in consciousness and hamper the continuity of the preceding dialog with the therapist. In the most extreme variety of dissociation (Dissociative Identity Disorder), an alternate ego state may appear during the clinical dialog, reporting (sometimes with an unusual tone of voice, e.g., like a child) memories of childhood abuse of which the patient has previously been totally unaware, or expressing attitudes and beliefs quite extraneous to the patients\\' personality.\\nFurthermore, shattered meaning propositions predominate. Trust, hope and sense of agency is accompanied by social avoidance, with loss of meaningful attachment and therefore lack of participation in preparing for future.\\nThe founding premise of attachment theory is that stress, especially traumatic stress, produces a strong desire for proximity to and comfort by attachment figures; this desire is built into human biology as a survival safety mechanism and the mechanism is functions unchanged throughout the life span. Attachment experience shapes the ways in which individuals manage stress and are especially important when individuals experience a traumatic event. When attachment is secure, individuals know how and when to seek attachment figures and develop internal representations of self as deserving of care. Attachment security fosters confidence and trust that figures are available, empathic, and sensitive to their needs; security is a buffer or resilience factor that supports recovery from trauma. When attachment is insecure, emotional and behavioral reactions when distressed may be made even more painful by unconscious evaluations that wishes for comfort are illegitimate. Insecurity may result in additional painful interactions with the attachment figures rather than the functional comfort and protection for which attachment was intended. Insecurity fosters anxiety, anger, and fear, and increases the risk of developing trauma-related emotional disorders. Extreme forms of insecurity are associated with the breakdown of attachment and caregiving regulatory mechanisms risk emotional and homeostatic dysregulation, often termed disorganized attachment. The risk of dysregulation is heightened when attachment relationships are threatened or threatening, such as parental loss or psychiatric debilitation or maltreatment. defined events such as these as attachment traumas, events that involve terrifying threats to the integrity of self or attachment relationships. Attachment disorganization, conceived in terms of mechanisms of dysregulation and attachment trauma, has been shown to predict vulnerability to severe psychiatric symptomology, including dissociative symptoms.\\n found the metaphor of a \"drama triangle\" useful in thinking about the intersection between dissociation and disorganized attachment. The dissociation triangle addresses how disorganized attachment fosters dissociative mechanisms that create incompatible and separate representations of self as victim, rescuer, and persecutor. The child\\'s representation of the attachment figure is represented in a conflicting manifold way. On the one side, the attachment figure is represented as source of the child\\'s fear, the self as a victim of attachment figure as persecutor. On the other side, the attachment figure by virtue of being the child\\'s biological protector is viewed as the child\\'s source of safety and protection (rescuer). In the child\\'s mind, representation of self and attachment figure shift among these three incompatible models that are too complex to be synthesized into an integrated model of self. Liotti\\'s model provides us with an integrated psychodynamic and attachment approach to our first questions concerning Gloria\\'s illness, questions regarding the childhood origins of her episodes of near unconsciousness and her inability to ask for help following traumatic assault.\\n examined cognitive perspectives on unresolved attachment in patients diagnosed with PTSD. They proposed that unresolved loss, as defined in attachment assessment during interview, involves intrusion avoidance phenomena similar to those of PTSD. Specifically, they develop a model based on unresolved loss that involves the failure to integrate representations of self and the world following a loss. The features of unresolved loss can be understood as emerging as a result of the activation of unintegrated representations of the loss experience and cognitive and behavioral avoidance processes. In this model, the sudden intrusion of memories, cognitions, and emotions associated with the loss automatically captures attention and initiates behavioral dispositions that are incompatible. With regard to attachment, the authors suggested that this was the mechanism that interfered with caregiving behavior. Lack of attentional resources and incompatible response tendencies can also result from safety behaviors directed at avoiding the perceived negative consequences of activating trauma memory. The authors proposed that these processes offer a novel way of understanding the disturbances in behavior and speech that are evident in mothers who are designated as unresolved with respect to loss.\\nThis suggests that representational attachment measures, like the AAP, can provide a good understanding of the movement that the client might be making toward empowerment, integration, or understanding. Thus, even if a patient\\'s overall attachment is unresolved (i.e., dysregulated), there may be indications in their responses to the AAP stimuli that suggest they are moving toward mental organization. Given the negative outcomes that are associated with abuse, focusing on resources and defensive strategies is arguably important for therapeutic recommendations.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"The DMD participants had different levels of hand function. Participant one (DP1, 20 years old) was able to use his hands functionally, and no contractures relevant to hand/wrist movement were observed. Participant two (DP2, 22 years old) was able to functionally use his hand but experienced a decrease in strength and minimal contractures relevant to hand/wrist movement. Participant three (DP3, 25 years old) was not able to use his hands at all and was affected by immediate onset of fatigue during its use. Extensive contractures relevant to finger movement were observed, and only minimal movement of the fingers was possible (see Supplementary Video). All participants were able to perform the experimental protocol.\\nThe Medical Ethics Committee of Twente approved the study design, the experimental protocol, and the procedures (Protocol number: NL59061.044.16). The study was conducted according to the ethical standards given in the Declaration of Helsinki in 1975, as revised in 2008.\\nThe experimental setup (Figure 1) included several components, and it was designed to record HD-sEMG signals from the forearm in a repeatable and systematic way. Muscular activity was measured with a 128-channel amplification system (REFA 128 model, TMS International, Oldenzaal, The Netherlands). We used 64 monopolar electrodes around the forearm to acquire the raw sEMG signals. The signals were recorded with a decimal gain of 26.55 before the analog-to-digital converter (ADC); however, this gain factor is compensated by the acquisition software (Polybench, TMS International, Oldenzaal, The Netherlands), after the ADC. Additionally, REFA includes a first-order analog low-pass filter placed before the ADC with a -3 db point at 6.8 kHz. The 6.8-kHz low pass helps to make the REFA immune to high-frequency electromagnetic interference such as mobile phone networks. The analog signals were sampled with a frequency of 2,048 Hz and digitally converted with a 24-bit conversion (a resolution of 0.018 muV per bit, 300 mV dynamic range). The ADC of the device has an anti-aliasing digital low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.2 * sample frequency. This filter inside the ADC is used to convert the 1-bit signal with a high frequency into a 24-bit signal with a lower frequency. The acquisition software was executed in a host laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad T490, Lenovo, Beijing, China) with a Windows 10 operating system (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, USA). A computer screen was used to provide visual feedback of the task to the participants.\\nElectrode placement and configuration were based on previous work that normalized the electrode locations to each participant's arm circumference in order to account for different forearm thicknesses (Table 1). The inter-electrode distance in the longitudinal direction of the forearm was kept constant at 2 cm for covering the entire forearm.\\nFirst, we cleaned the skin of the dominant forearm of the participant with alcohol. Then, we measured the forearm length from the lateral epicondyle until the styloid process of the ulna and the forearm circumference at 20% of the forearm length from the elbow (Figure 1). The participant had to wear a perforated sleeve (Figure 1) with equally placed holes and elastic only along the circumferal direction to ensure that the electrode placement was standardized for all participants. We used a non-permanent marker to mark the skin of the participant (Figure 1) and then visually inspect the markings before applying the electrodes.\\nConductive gel was applied to each of the 64 electrodes with a syringe, and they were subsequently attached to the forearm. The first row of electrodes was placed above the imaginary line between the lateral epicondyle and the styloid process of the ulna and the last row below in such a way that the line lay in the middle between the two rows of electrodes (Figure 1). The first electrode was attached proximally starting at the 20% of the forearm length from the elbow. Electrodes were placed from proximal to distal and in counterclockwise direction (from the perspective of a right-handed participant). This way, electrodes 1-32 were placed over the dorsal side (mostly extensor muscles) and 33-64 over the ventral side (mostly flexor muscles) of the forearm. The reference electrode was placed at the distal end of the forearm, over the head of the ulna.\\nParticipants performed seven different gestures involving hand and wrist motions (Figure 2). The chosen gestures included: hand open/close, thumb flexion/extension, wrist flexion/extension, and index extension. These were chosen as they are involved in the most frequent ADL. First, each participant was instructed to perform all gestures without constraints (dynamic) with maximal voluntary effort in a single recording. This way, we recorded the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for every electrode across all gestures. For every gesture, 10 repetitions of 3 s contractions were performed, together with 10 repetitions of 3-s resting periods between the contractions (Figure 2). The participants were instructed to perform all movements in a comfortable fashion in order to avoid forceful contractions that may elicit co-contractions of agonist-antagonist muscle groups.\\nThe timing of the gestures was dictated with the use of visual feedback. The visual feedback illustrated via photographs of human hands which gesture had to be performed. The sequence of images served to instruct the participant as a metronome when to perform the gesture (image of gesture appearing for 3 s) and when to relax (image of relaxed hand appearing for 3 s). Additionally, the measurements were performed in the morning in order to avoid effects of the end-of-the-day fatigue, especially for the participants with DMD. Furthermore, the participants had short breaks between gestures in order to rest.\\nAll signal processing and data analyses were performed in Matlab 2018b software (The MathWorks Inc., USA). The raw sEMG signals were processed offline in order to compute the envelopes for each of the 64 electrodes per gesture and per participant. First, the raw data were filtered with a band-pass filter (fourth-order Butterworth, 20-450 Hz). Additionally, a second-order digital infinite impulse response notch filter (cutoff frequency of 50 Hz, Q factor of 50) was used to remove the power line noise (50 Hz for the EU). Despite its main limitation (signal distortion around the attenuated frequency), notch filtering is the mainstream technique for powerline signal removal, and a narrow bandwidth with a high Q factor can already address this. For highly powerline-contaminated signals, spectral interpolation may be more appropriate. The signals were subsequently rectified and filtered with a low-pass filter (third-order Butterworth, 2 Hz). Our choice for the cutoff frequency was motivated by the low-frequency dynamic tasks involved in this study and our previous study on real-time sEMG control of a hand exoskeleton. The resulting envelopes were visually inspected segmented, according to the acquisition protocol, to 10 contractions and periods (each lasting approximately 3 s) and normalized. A threshold was selected to define the onset of the activity, and the next 3 s after the onset were chosen as a contraction period. The threshold was defined as the time that the signal exceeded 10 standard deviations of the baseline (non-contraction) activity similar to Di Fabio, and the final segmentation was additionally assessed visually. The maximum value of the envelope of each electrode across the complete dataset was used as a normalization value for each electrode. This value was acquired using a moving average window of 1 s in order to account for signal artifacts. Signal quality was visually assessed both in the time and frequency domains, and faulty channels were replaced by linear interpolation of their surrounding neighboring channels (8-neighborhood). Different local conditions were applied to faulty electrodes placed in the longitudinal extremes (<8 neighboring channels).\\nEvery 3-s contraction was further segmented in 1-s segments by keeping only the middle second of the contraction (steady-state phase) and discarding the transient phase. For every electrode, the average of this 1-s contraction was calculated and used to construct 10 heatmaps per gesture (Figure 2). For the visual inspection of the forearm activity per gesture, we constructed activity heatmaps by averaging the 10 repetition heatmaps (Figure 3).\\nWe analyzed the data to assess HD-sEMG pattern repeatability, peaks, and dimensionality, as well as individuals' potential to generate activation patterns suitable for myocontrol applications for both healthy and DMD participants. The raw data used for this analysis are available online. All signal processing and data analyses were performed in Matlab 2018b software (The Mathworks Inc., USA). In the remainder of this section, we describe a set of analyses aimed at investigating differences between DMD and healthy participants at the level of motor control properties (Motor Control Properties section) and myocontrol performance (Myocontrol Performance section).\\nThe degree of repeatability across repetitions per participant was calculated using squared Pearson correlation. Each heatmap (8 x 8) was reshaped into a vector (1 x 64) before the calculation of the squared Pearson correlation. The coefficient was extracted among the 10 repetitions per gesture and per participant. For every gesture, this resulted in 45 unique comparisons between the 10 repetitions and thus 45 coefficients per gesture (Figure 4).\\nThe temporal distribution of activations between healthy and DMD was calculated via normalized and absolute activations per repetition of each gesture (Figure 5A). A normalization factor was calculated across all gestures and repetitions. For each gesture, the maximum absolute and normalized value of the 64-electrode heatmap were calculated for every participant and each repetition and plotted.\\nFigure 5B shows the average spatial distribution of the healthy and DMD participants. The spatial distribution of the sEMG potentials over the 8 x 8 normalized heatmap was calculated using the center of gravity (COG) by calculating the dorsal-ventral and the proximal-distal position of it as proposed by Elswijk et al.. The COG was calculated over electrodes presenting activations equal or larger than 80% of the maximal value of the heatmap (Figure 3). This way, only clusters of electrodes with a high peak amplitude were considered for the calculation of the COG in order to focus on the most relevant area of activation for each gesture.\\nThe 10 heatmaps, one per gesture repetition, were used to construct one single average heatmap per gesture per participant (Figure 3) that was used for the motor control analysis. We quantified differences in dimensionality of orthogonal and uncorrelated sEMG patterns between the healthy and DMD participants via a PCA to the gesture-specific heatmaps per participant. For every participant, we performed a PCA to the concatenation (64 x 70) of the sEMG heatmaps of all gestures and repetitions per participant [64 electrodes x (7 gestures x 10 repetitions)]. The number of PCs needed to reconstruct the original seven gesture heatmaps was identified per participant by means of the variance explained (VE), and it was taken as the number of PCs that summed together explained more than 90% of the total variance. This number was used to explore the repertoire of orthogonal and uncorrelated sEMG patterns produced by the two groups of participants (Figure 6A).\\nAdditionally, we calculated the squared Pearson correlation between all the gestures per participant (the same way as we did for the repeatability, Activation Pattern Repeatability Tests section). The coefficient was extracted from the average normalized heatmap of the 10 repetitions per gesture and per participant. For every participant, this resulted in 21 unique comparisons between the seven gestures and thus 21 coefficients per participant. We averaged the correlation values of the healthy participants and the participants with DMD separately to identify which gestures are mostly correlated per population, and we presented this in the form of a similarity matrix (Figure 6B).\\nWe explored participants' gesture recognition performance via an offline pattern recognition algorithm applied to the band-pass filtered data (fourth-order Butterworth, 20-450 Hz) of each participant. We used a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to recognize each of the gestures performed. LDA is a commonly used pattern recognition algorithm for prosthetic control and already commercialized by COAPT LLC (Chicago, USA). We chose it for the ease of implementation, classification speed, and high accuracy compared to other similar approaches. The 10 steady-state segments for every gesture were concatenated and created a 10-s vector. We trained the classifier by extracting four time-domain features from the raw segmented data including mean absolute value, zero crossing, slope sign change, and waveform length. We chose for a feature extraction window of 200 ms (with an overlap of 100 ms), which would be within acceptable range for real-time myoelectric applications. The classifier was validated with a three-split Monte Carlo cross-validation approach. Each time, a different part of the segmented data was used for training (always 70%) and testing (always 30%). The average off-line classification accuracy of these three trainings was used as performance metric per participant. Additionally, we tested how the offline classification accuracy per participant was affected by the number of gestures that had to be classified.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'For each death, the DSS has systematically recorded the age at death and the date of death (including day and month of death). A detailed VA questionnaire has been collected for deaths of children aged < 15 years old since 1985, and for all deaths since 2003. VA questionnaires are usually completed by close relatives of the deceased. For adults, they include an assessment of whether the deceased was pregnant at the time of death. After review of VA data by physicians, a likely cause of death is assigned to each recorded death using ICD-9 codes. According to this database, maternal mortality is high ( 915 per 100,000 live births for 2003-06,).\\nIn August 2010, we conducted a pilot study aimed at determining the feasibility of linking retrospective survey data collected during SSH to DSS data, at the individual level. Prior studies comparing SSH and DSS data had been conducted at the aggregate level, and thus did not permit examining misclassification biases. In total, we interviewed 268 women aged 15-59 years who had at least one female sibling known to have died at reproductive ages according to the DSS datasets since the 1980s. Respondents were asked to complete the standard SSH questionnaire used during the 2005 DHS in Senegal. Interviewers were recruited among those who had participated in that DHS. Some survey respondents were members of the same sibship, and some deaths were thus potentially reported multiple times during the SSH survey.\\nWe focus here on the subset of deaths having occurred in 2003-2009 because detailed VA questionnaires for adult deaths were systematically introduced in the Bandafassi DSS in 2003, and because this period matches the \"reference period\" usually used in producing estimates of adult and maternal mortality using SSH data (Timaeus and Jasseh 2004). We identify PR deaths in the DSS data as follows: 1) we use demographic surveillance data on dates of births and deaths to identify deaths having occurred at the time of delivery or within 2 months of a delivery regardless of the actual cause; 2) we use data from the VA questionnaires (i.e., a yes/no question asking VA respondent whether the deceased was pregnant at the time of the survey) to identify deaths having occurred during pregnancy. It is important to note that, in order to classify a death as PR or non-PR according to the DSS data, we do not use the ICD-9 codes assigned by physicians to each death. In SSH data, we define PR deaths as deaths reported to have occurred either during pregnancy, delivery or within 2 months of delivery according to the respondent.\\nWe could not compare PR classifications obtained from SSH and DSS data for all deaths observed between 2003 and 2009 because, for some of the deceased, there were no eligible sisters in the DSS population or eligible sisters could not be located. In other cases, we could not ascertain whether the recorded death was PR because of missing data in the DSS dataset and/or the VA questionnaire. We thus begin by comparing the age at death, date of death, and PR classification obtained from the DSS of included vs. excluded deaths. We do so using chi2 tests of association. Among included deaths, we then examine the cross-classification of deaths as PR or non-PR, according to the SSH and DSS data. We calculate the proportion of deaths identified as PR (non-PR) in the DSS dataset, which were also classified as PR (non-PR) deaths in the SSH data. We do so for all reports collected during the SSH survey, and for a restricted sample in which we select at random one report of death per sibship (to avoid double-counting). In the case of discrepant classifications of PR deaths between SSH and DSS data, we report a) the cause of death as ascertained by physicians (using VA data), b) the time since the last recorded birth of the deceased, and c) the relationship between the deceased and the person who completed the VA questionnaire (e.g., sister-in-law). Finally, we use SSH data to investigate agreement between sisters about the reported timing of death in sibships where multiple sisters were interviewed.',\n",

There is no significant difference in median age between male and female groups, but the maximum of the range of IQR is lower in male (66 years in men vs. 73 years in women). Symptoms and comorbidities were comparable between men and women. As expected, men had a higher level of hemoglobin. However, male patients also had elevated serum creatinine, white blood cells, and neutrophils.

Coronary angiography indicated approximately 60-80% stenosis of the anterior descending coronary artery (Figure 1B), ECG testing also suggested the patient suffered from CHD (Figure 1C). However, the lipid testing described the level of LDL-c (3.94 mmol/L; control: <3.12 mmol/L) and a distinctly reduced levels of HDL-c (0.41 mmol/L; control: 0.9-2.19 mmol/L) of the proband (Table 1). This discovery attracted our interest because most patients with ASCVD commonly presented high levels of LDL-c, TC, and TG. We then investigated the family history of the proband (II-2), which indicated that her young sister (II-4) has been diagnosed as the occlusion of left iliac artery and her father (I-1) was died from myocardial infarction at 60-year-old. Lipid testing further described that both her son (III-1) and her young sister (II-4) showed an overt reduced levels of HDL-c and normal levels of LDL-c, TC, and TG (Table 1). And his young sister (II-4) also suffered from arterial plaque in the left lower limb. The blood pressure of the proband was 80-120 mmHg and the fasting blood-glucose was 5.2 mmol/L. The proband (II-2) accepted the treatment of percutaneous coronary intervention, the proband did not complain any uncomfortable after treatment. And breathing sound of the lungs was clearly, the heart rate was normal (Figure 1D), and the insertion site recovered well. The II-4 is accepting recovery treatment by exercise and diet control.\\nWe supposed that the low levels of HDL-c may be the leading cause of AS and ASCVD in this family. However, what's the genetic lesion underling the reduced levels of HDL-c in this family? We then isolated the genomic DNA of the proband and other family members (I-2, II-1, II-2, II-4, III-1, and III-2). Whole exome sequencing of the proband (II-2) was performed to detect the candidate gene of reduced levels of HDL-c.\\nIn short, Exome capture and next-generation sequencing were conducted by Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China). One microgram of qualified genomic DNA from each person was captured by the Agilent's SureSelect Human All Exon kit V5 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States) and sequenced by Illumina Hiseq4000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, United States). Shortly, genomic DNA were randomly carved by Covaris S220 sonicator (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, United States). Then the fragmented DNAs underwent three enzymatic steps: end repair, A-tailing and adapters ligation. The adapter-ligated DNA fragments were amplified with Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent). Later, the exomes in the pre-capture libraries were captured by SureSelect capture library kit (Agilent). After DNA quality estimation, the captured DNA library was used for next-generation sequencing on Illumina Hiseq4000 platform. Downstream processing was carried out by Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), Varscan2 and Picard, and variant calls were performed by the GATK Haplotype Caller. Variant annotation referred to Ensemble release 82, and filtering was conducted by ANNOVAR Documentation.\\nThe filtered non-synonymous SNPs or INDELs with an alternative allele frequency more than 1% in public databases were kicked before further analysis. The public databases contains the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project Exome Variant Server (ESP6500), dbSNP1441, the 1000 Genomes project2, the ExAC database3 and in-house exome databases of Novogene (2500 exomes). Then the filtered SNVs and INDELs, predicted by SIFT4, Polyphen25, and MutationTaster6 to be damaging, were remained.\\nAfter data filtering, a novel nonsense mutation (NM_007168: c.3460C>T; p.R1154X) of ABCA8 was identified and validated by Sanger sequencing in the proband (Figure 1E). Previous studies have revealed that deleterious heterozygous ABCA8 mutations may disrupt cholesterol efflux and reduce HDL-c levels in humans and mice. No other meaningful mutations related to lipid metabolism has been identified. Sanger sequencing further confirmed that only the affected individuals (II-2, II-4, and III-1) carried the novel nonsense mutation (NM_007168: c.3460C>T; p.R1154X) of ABCA8 (Figure 1F). The novel mutation, resulting a truncated protein, was absent in the healthy members (I-2, II-1, and III-2) and 200 local people who were used as an internal control to exclude the SNP in local people. Bioinformatics predicted that the newly identified mutation was deleterious and may disrupt the structure and function of ABCA8. On the basis of ACMG guidelines, the novel variant meetings the following criteria from the ACMG guidelines: PVS1, PS3, and PM2.\",\n",

No complications occurred, and the HFS symptoms were relieved for 4 days. Thus, we decided to perform PRF on the facial nerve. In the right lateral decubitus position, the patient's chin was slightly lifted, which exposed the mastoid process. Both sides of the mastoid process and mandible were superimposed on a lateral fluoroscope imaging view (Fig. 1). The skin was prepared with betadine and aseptic draping.

       "    'case_text': \"A 32-year-old woman in the 28th week of her fifth pregnancy was referred to our institution with a 3-week history of fetal bradycardia (fetal heart rate 60 beats per minute [bpm]). She had no personal or family histories of cardiac arrest, seizures, or syncope. Of her 4 pregnancies, only 1 had ended in a miscarriage. The initial fetal echocardiogram at our institution revealed a structurally normal heart with normal size, normal function, and second-degree AVB (V rate 60 bpm, atrial rate 120 bpm). Her antibody screen was negative for anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. One week later, a follow-up fetal echocardiogram showed a ventricular rate of 220 bpm (atrial rate was 130 bpm) (Figure 1A). An fMCG was then performed which revealed nonsustained VT alternating with sinus rhythm (rate 130 bpm) (Figure 1B). The VT was present about 75% of the time. The QTc was 591 ms (Figure 1C).\\nOver the ensuing days, the TdP continued and the fetus developed severe hydrops. We therefore decided to administer an intravenous loading dose of magnesium (4 g) followed by a continuous infusion (1-1.4 g/h) to maintain a maternal serum level of 1.2-1.4 (normal = 0.65-1.05 mmol/L). The mother's baseline magnesium level was 0.72 mmol/L. Within 3 days of magnesium infusion the frequency of TdP decreased (by fMCG the fetus was in sinus rhythm 80% of the time). Because of the concern for an SCN5A R1623Q mutation, we began treatment with mexiletine (600 mg orally per day). The fetus remained in sinus rhythm (rate 100 bpm) with continuous magnesium infusion and oral mexiletine given to the mother. At 35 weeks the fetus became bradycardic and was found to be in second-degree AVB.\\nThe mother underwent an elective cesarean section at 35 weeks' gestation and a 2334-g male infant was delivered. The heart rate at birth was 56 bpm owing to functional second-degree AVB with 2:1 conduction (Figure 2A). Immediately after delivery, temporary transvenous pacing wires were placed. On the second day of life, a permanent pacemaker was implanted. We also administered oral mexiletine (4 mg/kg/d) and intravenous propranolol (0.02 mg/kg/h); no VT was observed. On the 14th day of life, the infant's electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block pattern (Figure 2B). On the 40th day of life, the mexiletine blood levels declined, and TdP occurred despite ventricular pacing (VVI 80 bpm). The TdP spontaneously terminated.\\nThe VVI pacing rate was increased to 110 bpm. When the infant was at the age of 5 months, weighing 6.6 kg, we placed an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The shock lead was implanted subcutaneously through the left thoracodorsal region, and the generator was placed under the right abdominal rectus muscle (Figure 2C). Following implantation of the ICD, the child did not experience any appropriate or inappropriate shocks during 4 years of follow-up. He received oral mexiletine (12 mg/kg/d) and propranolol (2 mg/kg/d).\\nGenetic testing of this case revealed a KCNH2 missense mutation (S624R). To date, there has been no functional analysis of this mutation. His mother's QTc was 440 ms, and his father's was 390 ms. Neither of the parents had any mutation in this locus. However, we did not exclude parental germinal mosaicism.\",\n",

The family history was positive for a paternal KCNH2 missense mutation (T613M) diagnosed after a syncopal episode. The fetal echocardiogram revealed a peristent tachycardia with atrioventricular dissociation (Figure 3A). The fMCG confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VT with a rate of 220 bpm (Figure 3B) with a prolonged (511 ms) QTc during brief (<20% of the recording time) episodes of sinus rhythm (rate 110-120 bpm) (Figure 3C). The mother was admitted to the hospital for continuous intravenous magnesium treatment to terminate the fetal VT. However, despite maternal serum magnesium levels of 1.28 mmol/L (normal range 0.65-1.05 mmol/L), the VT persisted and the fetus became hydropic (Figure 3D). Ten days after the mother was on magnesium, we initiated propranolol (initial dose 60-120 mg orally per day), following which the VT resolved. We continued magnesium by a continuous infusion (1.4 g/h) after we started propranolol. fMCG revealed a decreased fetal sinus rate from 120 to 110 bpm. The hydrops then improved gradually. The mother's daily total heart beats decreased from 129,108 to 103,206 (average heart rate decreased from 90 to 71 bpm) after propranolol administration, indicating beta-adrenergic blocking effect. Subsequently, the fetal sinus rhythm (rate 110 bpm) was maintained. A 2010-g female infant was delivered by elective cesarean delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. After birth, the infant's electrocardiography showed an intermittent left bundle branch block pattern. On the fifth day of life, she developed second-degree AVB with a ventricular rate of 60-80 bpm and metabolic acidemia owing to poor cardiac output. She urgently underwent temporary epicardial ventricular pacing lead implantation. At the age of 3 months, sustained VT occurred immediately after permanent pacemaker implantation and was successfully terminated by cardioversion. Hypokalemia (serum potassium level was 2.9 mmol/L) during intensive care likely contributed to the VT. VT did not recur after the potassium was corrected. Her genetic testing identified the KCNH2 missense mutation (T613M), identical to that of her father. She received oral mexiletine (7 mg/kg/d) and propranolol (3 mg/kg/d) with pacing (VVI 110 bpm) for 23 months.\",\n",

At age 31, she experienced status epilepticus subsequent to a febrile episode and following prolonged coma that continued several weeks. She had no prior history of epilepsy or seizure-related disorders. Initial diagnosis was limbic encephalitis, based on inflammatory findings of cerebrospinal fluid. She was treated with intravenous steroid administration and plasma exchange at another hospital. Although she gradually recovered from comatose state and discharged home in two months without any disability for daily living, symptomatic epilepsy with frequent seizures with impaired awareness persisted. She described that her seizure started with strange odor or deja vu sensation, and then she felt dizziness or lightheadedness. It sometimes accompanied jerky movements of the right side of her face and arm, and eventually led to impaired awareness. Although she was taking levetiracetam 1000 mg and lamotrigine 400 mg, she usually had 1-2 seizures a day. She had previously taken carbamazepine, lacosamide, perampanel and topiramate which did not lead to improvement.\\nHer latest brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cluster of variably sized multiple nodular high intensity lesions on T2-weighted image (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in white matter of the left temporal lobe along with the border of inner cortex (Fig. 1A). The lesions did not show any mass effect or enhancement with gadolinium. Similar findings were also observed in the past MRI when the patient had encephalitis two years before, and the size of the lesions were not different from the latest one. The characteristics of MRI findings were consistent with those of MVNT. 18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) of brain demonstrated moderate decrease of uptake in the lesion area (Fig. 1B). Laboratory findings of her blood and cerebrospinal fluid did not reveal any other causes of epilepsy.\\nLong-term video electroencephalogram (vEEG) was performed for 72 h and three habitual seizures were recorded: Two of them started with deja vu and strange odor sensation followed by nodding movement of the head and subsequent fluttering of right hand and foot. Her consciousness was partially impaired during the seizure. vEEG showed rhythmic wave that started from the left middle temporal area and spread to the ipsilateral frontal region, and then to the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 2A); The other started with lightheadedness and vEEG showed similar rhythmic waves that started from the right anterior temporal area (Fig. 2B). Interictal EEG showed frequent multifocal spikes and sharp waves in the bilateral anterior to middle temporal area.\\nBased on the EEG findings that demonstrated the multiple independent seizure onsets in both hemispheres, the patient was considered to have bilateral multifocal epileptic foci, whereas the lesions with MVNT appearance on MRI were localized in the left temporal lobe. Although MVNT had been described as an epilepsy-related brain tumor, we refrained from resection surgery because it was not certain that the lesions were epileptogenic in this patient.

       "    'case_text': 'Considerable variations in recursive abilities have also been observed developmentally. Dickinson showed that recursive language production abilities emerge gradually, in a piecemeal fashion. On the comprehension side, training improves comprehension of singly embedded relative clause constructions both in 3-4-year old children (Roth,) and adults (Wells et al.,), independent of other cognitive factors. Level of education further correlates with the ability to comprehend complex recursive sentences (Dabrowska,). More generally, these developmental differences are likely to reflect individual variations in experience with language (see Christiansen and Chater, Forthcoming), differences that may further be amplified by variations in the structural and distributional characteristics of the language being spoken.\\nTogether, these individual, developmental and cross-linguistic differences in dealing with recursive linguistic structure cannot easily be explained in terms of a fundamental recursive competence, constrained by fixed biological constraints on performance. That is, the variation in recursive abilities across individuals, development, and languages are hard to explain in terms of performance factors, such as language-independent constraints on memory, processing or attention, imposing limitations on an otherwise infinite recursive grammar. Invoking such limitations would require different biological constraints on working memory, processing, or attention for speakers of different languages, which seems highly unlikely. To resolve these issues, we need to separate claims about recursive mechanisms from claims about recursive structure: the ability to deal with a limited amount of recursive structure in language does not necessitate the postulation of recursive mechanisms to process them. Thus, instead of treating recursion as an a priori property of the language faculty, we need to provide a mechanistic account able to accommodate the actual degree of recursive structure found across both natural languages and natural language users: no more and no less.\\nWe favor an account of the processing of recursive structure that builds on construction grammar and usage-based approaches to language. The essential idea is that the ability to process recursive structure does not depend on a built-in property of a competence grammar but, rather, is an acquired skill, learned through experience with specific instances of recursive constructions and limited generalizations over these (Christiansen and MacDonald,). Performance limitations emerge naturally through interactions between linguistic experience and cognitive constraints on learning and processing, ensuring that recursive abilities degrade in line with human performance across languages and individuals. We show how our usage-based account of recursion can accommodate human data on the most complex recursive structures that have been found in naturally occurring language: center-embeddings and cross-dependencies. Moreover, we suggest that the human ability to process recursive structures may have evolved on top of our broader abilities for complex sequence learning. Hence, we argue that language processing, implemented by domain-general mechanisms:not recursive grammars:is what endows language with its hallmark productivity, allowing it to \"...make infinite employment of finite means,\" as the celebrated German linguist, Wilhelm von Humboldt (: p. 91), noted more than a century and a half ago.\\nLanguage processing involves extracting regularities from highly complex sequentially organized input, suggesting a connection between general sequence learning (e.g., planning, motor control, etc., Lashley,) and language: both involve the extraction and further processing of discrete elements occurring in temporal sequences (see also e.g., Greenfield,; Conway and Christiansen,; Bybee,; de Vries et al.,, for similar perspectives). Indeed, there is comparative, genetic, and neural evidence suggesting that humans may have evolved specific abilities for dealing with complex sequences. Experiments with non-human primates have shown that they can learn both fixed sequences, akin to a phone number (e.g., Heimbauer et al.,), and probabilistic sequences, similar to \"statistical learning\" in human studies (e.g., Heimbauer et al.,, under review; Wilson et al.,). However, regarding complex recursive non-linguistic sequences, non-human primates appear to have significant limitations relative to human children (e.g., in recursively sequencing actions to nest cups within one another; Greenfield et al.,; Johnson-Pynn et al.,). Although more carefully controlled comparisons between the sequence learning abilities of human and non-primates are needed (see Conway and Christiansen,, for a review), the currently available data suggest that humans may have evolved a superior ability to deal with sequences involving complex recursive structures.\\nThe current knowledge regarding the FOXP2 gene is consistent with the suggestion of a human adaptation for sequence learning (for a review, see Fisher and Scharff,). FOXP2 is highly conserved across species but two amino acid changes have occurred after the split between humans and chimps, and these became fixed in the human population about 200,000 years ago (Enard et al.,). In humans, mutations to FOXP2 result in severe speech and orofacial motor impairments (Lai et al.,; MacDermot et al.,). Studies of FOXP2 expression in mice and imaging studies of an extended family pedigree with FOXP2 mutations have provided evidence that this gene is important to neural development and function, including of the cortico-striatal system (Lai et al.,). When a humanized version of Foxp2 was inserted into mice, it was found to specifically affect cortico-basal ganglia circuits (including the striatum), increasing dendrite length and synaptic plasticity (Reimers-Kipping et al.,). Indeed, synaptic plasticity in these circuits appears to be key to learning action sequences (Jin and Costa,); and, importantly, the cortico-basal ganglia system has been shown to be important for sequence (and other types of procedural) learning (Packard and Knowlton,). Crucially, preliminary findings from a mother and daughter pair with a translocation involving FOXP2 indicate that they have problems with both language and sequence learning (Tomblin et al.,). Finally, we note that sequencing deficits also appear to be associated with specific language impairment (SLI) more generally (e.g., Tomblin et al.,; Lum et al.,; Hsu et al.,; see Lum et al.,, for a review).\\nHence, both comparative and genetic evidence suggests that humans have evolved complex sequence learning abilities, which, in turn, appear to have been pressed into service to support the emergence of our linguistic skills. This evolutionary scenario would predict that language and sequence learning should have considerable overlap in terms of their neural bases. This prediction is substantiated by a growing bulk of research in the cognitive neurosciences, highlighting the close relationship between sequence learning and language (see Ullman,; Conway and Pisoni,, for reviews). For example, violations of learned sequences elicit the same characteristic event-related potential (ERP) brainwave response as ungrammatical sentences, and with the same topographical scalp distribution (Christiansen et al.,). Similar ERP results have been observed for musical sequences (Patel et al.,). Additional evidence for a common domain-general neural substrate for sequence learning and language comes from functional imaging (fMRI) studies showing that sequence violations activate Broca\\'s area (Lieberman et al.,; Petersson et al.,; Forkstam et al.,), a region in the left inferior frontal gyrus forming a key part of the cortico-basal ganglia network involved in language. Results from a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment further suggest that Broca\\'s area plays a crucial role in the processing of musical sequences (Maess et al.,).\\nIf language is subserved by the same neural mechanisms as used for sequence processing, then we would expect a breakdown of syntactic processing to be associated with impaired sequencing abilities. Christiansen et al. tested this prediction in a population of agrammatic aphasics, who have severe problems with natural language syntax in both comprehension and production due to lesions involving Broca\\'s area (e.g., Goodglass and Kaplan,; Goodglass, :see Novick et al.,; Martin,, for reviews). They confirmed that agrammatism was associated with a deficit in sequence learning in the absence of other cognitive impairments. Similar impairments to the processing of musical sequences by the same population were observed in a study by Patel et al.. Moreover, success in sequence learning is predicted by white matter density in Broca\\'s area, as revealed by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (Floel et al.,). Importantly, applying transcranial direct current stimulation (de Vries et al.,) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (Udden et al.,) to Broca\\'s area during sequence learning or testing improves performance. Together, these cognitive neuroscience studies point to considerable overlap in the neural mechanisms involved in language and sequence learning2, as predicted by our evolutionary account (see also Wilkins and Wakefield,; Christiansen et al.,; Hoen et al.,; Ullman,; Conway and Pisoni,, for similar perspectives).\\nComparative and genetic evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that humans have evolved more complex sequence learning mechanisms, whose neural substrates subsequently were recruited for language. But how might recursive structure recruit such complex sequence learning abilities? Reali and Christiansen explored this question using simple recurrent networks (SRNs; Elman,). The SRN is a type of connectionist model that implements a domain-general learner with sensitivity to complex sequential structure in the input. This model is trained to predict the next element in a sequence and learns in a self-supervised manner to correct any violations of its own expectations regarding what should come next. The SRN model has been successfully applied to the modeling of both sequence learning (e.g., Servan-Schreiber et al.,; Botvinick and Plaut,) and language processing (e.g., Elman,), including multiple-cue integration in speech segmentation (Christiansen et al.,) and syntax acquisition (Christiansen et al.,). To model the difference in sequence learning skills between humans and non-human primates, Reali and Christiansen first \"evolved\" a group of networks to improve their performance on a sequence-learning task in which they had to predict the next digit in a five-digit sequence generated by randomizing the order of the digits, 1-5 (based on a human task developed by Lee,). At each generation, the best performing network was selected, and its initial weights (prior to any training):i.e., their \"genome\":was slightly altered to produce a new generation of networks. After 500 generations of this simulated \"biological\" evolution, the resulting networks performed significantly better than the first generation SRNs.\\nReali and Christiansen then introduced language into the simulations. Each miniature language was generated by a context-free grammar derived from the grammar skeleton in Table 1. This grammar skeleton incorporated substantial flexibility in word order insofar as the material on the right-hand side of each rule could be ordered as it is (right-branching), in the reverse order (left-branching), or have a flexible order (i.e., the constituent order is as is half of time, and the reverse the other half of the time). Using this grammar skeleton, it is possible to instantiate 36 (= 729) distinct grammars, with differing degrees of consistency in the ordering of sentence constituents. Reali and Christiansen implemented both biological and cultural evolution in their simulations: As with the evolution of better sequence learners, the initial weights of the network that best acquired a language in a given generation were slightly altered to produce the next generation of language learners:with the additional constraint that performance on the sequence learning task had to be maintained at the level reached at the end of the first part of the simulation (to capture the fact that humans are still superior sequence learners today). Cultural evolution of language was simulated by having the networks learn several different languages at each generation and then selecting the best learnt language as the basis for the next generation. The best learnt language was then varied slightly by changing the directions of a rule to produce a set of related \"offspring\" languages for each generation.\\nAlthough the simulations started with language being completely flexible, and thus without any reliable word order constraints, after <100 generations of cultural evolution, the resulting language had adopted consistent word order constraints in all but one of the six rules. When comparing the networks from the first generation at which language was introduced and the final generation, Reali and Christiansen found no difference in linguistic performance. In contrast, when comparing network performance on the initial (all-flexible) language vs. the final language, a very large difference in learnability was observed. Together, these two analyses suggest that it was the cultural evolution of language, rather than biological evolution of better learners, that allowed language to become more easily learned and more structurally consistent across these simulations. More generally, the simulation results provide an existence proof that recursive structure can emerge in natural language by way of cultural evolution in the absence of language-specific constraints.\\nNP   {N (PP)}\\nPP   {adp NP}\\nAn important remaining question is whether human learners are sensitive to the kind of sequence learning constraints revealed by Reali and Christiansen\\'s simulated process of cultural evolution. A key result of these simulations was that the sequence learning constraints embedded in the SRNs tend to favor what we will refer to as recursive consistency (Christiansen and Devlin,). Consider rewrite rules (2) and (3) from Table 1: \\n(3) [NP buildings [PP from [NP cities [PP with [NP smog]]]]]\\n(4) [NP [PP [NP [PP [NP smog] with] cities] from] buildings]\\n(5) [NP buildings [PP [NP cities [PP [NP smog] with]] from]]\\n(6) [NP [PP from [NP [PP with [NP smog]] cities]] buildings]\\nTogether, these two skeleton rules form a recursive rule set because each calls the other. Ignoring the flexible version of these two rules, we get the four possible recursive rule sets shown in Table 2. Using these rules sets we can generate the complex noun phrases seen in (3)-(6): \\nThe first two rules sets from Table 2 generate recursively consistent structures that are either right-branching (as in 3) or left-branching (as in 4). The prepositions and postpositions, respectively, are always in close proximity to their noun complements, making it easier for a sequence learner to discover their relationship. In contrast, the final two rule sets generate recursively inconsistent structures, involving center-embeddings: all nouns are either stacked up before all the postpositions (5) or after all the prepositions (6). In both cases, the learner has to work out that from and cities together form a prepositional phrase, despite being separated from each other by another prepositional phrase involving with and smog. This process is further complicated by an increase in memory load caused by the intervening prepositional phrase. From a sequence learning perspective, it should therefore be easier to acquire the recursively consistent structure found in (3) and (4) compared with the recursively inconsistent structure in (5) and (6). Indeed, all the simulation runs in Reali and Christiansen resulted in languages in which both recursive rule sets were consistent.\\nChristiansen and Devlin had previously shown that SRNs perform better on recursively consistent structure (such as those in 3 and 4). However, if human language has adapted by way of cultural evolution to avoid recursive inconsistencies (such as 5 and 6), then we should expect people to be better at learning recursively consistent artificial languages than recursively inconsistent ones. Reeder, following initial work by Christiansen, tested this prediction by exposing participants to one of two artificial languages, generated by the artificial grammars shown in Table 3. Notice that the consistent grammar instantiates a left-branching grammar from the grammar skeleton used by Reali and Christiansen, involving two recursively consistent rule sets (rules 2-3 and 5-6). The inconsistent grammar differs only in the direction of two rules (3 and 5), which are right-branching, whereas the other three rules are left-branching. The languages were instantiated using 10 spoken non-words to generate the sentences to which the participants were exposed. Participants in the two language conditions would see sequences of the exact same lexical items, only differing in their order of occurrence as dictated by the respective grammar (e.g., consistent: jux vot hep vot meep nib vs. inconsistent: jux meep hep vot vot nib). After training, the participants were presented with a new set of sequences, one by one, for which they were asked to judge whether or not these new items were generated by the same rules as the ones they saw previously. Half of the new items incorporated subtle violations of the sequence ordering (e.g., grammatical: cav hep vot lum meep nib vs. ungrammatical: cav hep vot rud meep nib, where rud is ungrammatical in this position).\\nThe results of this artificial language learning experiment showed that the consistent language was learned significantly better (61.0% correct classification) than the inconsistent one (52.7%). It is important to note that because the consistent grammar was left-branching (and thus more like languages such as Japanese and Hindi), knowledge of English cannot explain the results. Indeed, if anything, the two right-branching rules in the inconsistent grammar bring that language closer to English3. To further demonstrate that the preferences for consistently recursive sequences is a domain-general bias, Reeder conducted a second experiment, in which the sequences were instantiated using black abstract shapes that cannot easily be verbalized. The results of the second study closely replicated those of the first, suggesting that there may be general sequence learning biases that favor recursively consistent structures, as predicted by Reali and Christiansen\\'s evolutionary simulations.\\nThe question remains, though, whether such sequence learning biases can drive cultural evolution of language in humans. That is, can sequence-learning constraints promote the emergence of language-like structure when amplified by processes of cultural evolution? To answer this question, Cornish et al. (under review) conducted an iterated sequence learning experiment, modeled on previous human iterated learning studies involving miniature language input (Kirby et al.,). Participants were asked to participate in a memory experiment, in which they were presented with 15 consonant strings. Each string was presented briefly on a computer screen after which the participants typed it in. After multiple repetitions of the 15 strings, the participants were asked to recall all of them. They were requested to continue recalling items until they had provided 15 unique strings. The recalled 15 strings were then recoded in terms of their specific letters to avoid trivial biases such as the location of letters on the computer keyboard and the presence of potential acronyms (e.g., X might be replaced throughout by T, T by M, etc.). The resulting set of 15 strings (which kept the same underlying structure as before recoding) was then provided as training strings for the next participant. A total of 10 participants were run within each \"evolutionary\" chain.\\nThe initial set of strings used for the first participant in each chain was created so as to have minimal distributional structure (all consonant pairs, or bigrams, had a frequency of 1 or 2). Because recalling 15 arbitrary strings is close to impossible given normal memory constraints, it was expected that many of the recalled items would be strongly affected by sequence learning biases. The results showed that as these sequence biases became amplified across generations of learners, the sequences gained more and more distributional structure (as measured by the relative frequency of repeated two- and three-letter units). Importantly, the emerging system of sequences became more learnable. Initially, participants could only recall about 4 of the 15 strings correctly but by the final generation this had doubled, allowing participants to recall more than half the strings. Importantly, this increase in learnability did not evolve at the cost of string length: there was no decrease across generations. Instead, the sequences became easy to learn and recall because they formed a system, allowing subsequences to be reused productively. Using network analyses (see Baronchelli et al.,, for a review), Cornish et al. demonstrated that the way in which this productivity was implemented strongly mirrored that observed for child-directed speech.\\nThe results from Cornish et al. (under review) suggest that sequence learning constraints, as those explored in the simulations by Reali and Christiansen and demonstrated by Reeder, can give rise to language-like distributional regularities that facilitate learning. This supports our hypothesis that sequential learning constraints, amplified by cultural transmission, could have shaped language into what we see today, including its limited use of embedded recursive structure. Next, we shall extend this approach to show how the same sequence learning constraints that we hypothesized to have shaped important aspects of the cultural evolution of recursive structures also can help explain specific patterns in the processing of complex recursive constructions.\\nSo far, we have discussed converging evidence supporting the theory that language in important ways relies on evolutionarily prior neural mechanisms for sequence learning. But can a domain-general sequence learning device capture the ability of humans to process the kind of complex recursive structures that has been argued to require powerful grammar formalisms (e.g., Chomsky,; Shieber,; Stabler,; Jager and Rogers,)? From our usage-based perspective, the answer does not necessarily require the postulation of recursive mechanisms as long as the proposed mechanisms can deal with the level of complex recursive structure that humans can actually process. In other words, what needs to be accounted for is the empirical evidence regarding human processing of complex recursive structures, and not theoretical presuppositions about recursion as a stipulated property of our language system.\\nChristiansen and MacDonald conducted a set of computational simulations to determine whether a sequence-learning device such as the SRN would be able to capture human processing performance on complex recursive structures. Building on prior work by Christiansen and Chater, they focused on the processing of sentences with center-embedded and cross-dependency structures. These two types of recursive constructions produce multiple overlapping non-adjacent dependencies, as illustrated in Figure 1, resulting in rapidly increasing processing difficulty as the number of embeddings grows. We have already discussed earlier how performance on center-embedded constructions breaks down at two levels of embedding (e.g., Wang,; Hamilton and Deese,; Blaubergs and Braine,; Hakes et al.,). The processing of cross-dependencies, which exist in Swiss-German and Dutch, has received less attention, but the available data also point to a decline in performance with increased levels of embedding (Bach et al.,; Dickey and Vonk,). Christiansen and MacDonald trained networks on sentences derived from one of the two grammars shown in Table 4. Both grammars contained a common set of recursive structures: right-branching recursive structure in the form of prepositional modifications of noun phrases, noun phrase conjunctions, subject relative clauses, and sentential complements; left-branching recursive structure in the form of prenominal possessives. The grammars furthermore had three additional verb argument structures (transitive, optionally transitive, and intransitive) and incorporated agreement between subject nouns and verbs. As illustrated by Table 4, the only difference between the two grammars was in the type of complex recursive structure they contained: center-embedding vs. cross-dependency.\\nThe grammars could generate a variety of sentences, with varying degree of syntactic complexity, from simple transitive sentences (such as 7) to more complex sentences involving different kinds of recursive structure (such as 8 and 9).\\n(7) John kisses Mary.\\n(8) Mary knows that John\\'s boys\\' cats see mice.\\n(9) Mary who loves John thinks that men say that girls chase boys.\\nThe generation of sentences was further restricted by probabilistic constraints on the complexity and depth of recursion. Following training on either grammar, the networks performed well on a variety of recursive sentence structures, demonstrating that the SRNs were able to acquire complex grammatical regularities (see also Christiansen,)4. The networks acquired sophisticated abilities for generalizing across constituents in line with usage-based approaches to constituent structure (e.g., Beckner and Bybee,; see also Christiansen and Chater,). Differences between networks were observed, though, on their processing of the complex recursive structure permitted by the two grammars.\\nTo model human data on the processing of center-embedding and cross-dependency structures, Christiansen and MacDonald relied on a study conducted by Bach et al. in which sentences with two center-embeddings in German were found to be significantly harder to process than comparable sentences with two cross-dependencies in Dutch. Bach et al. asked native Dutch speakers to rate the comprehensibility of Dutch sentences involving varying depths of recursive structure in the form of cross-dependency constructions and corresponding right-branching paraphrase sentences with similar meaning. Native speakers of German were tested using similar materials in German, where center-embedded constructions replaced the cross-dependency constructions. To remove potential effects of processing difficulty due to length, the ratings from the right-branching paraphrase sentences were subtracted from the complex recursive sentences. Figure 2 shows the results of the Bach et al. study on the left-hand side.\\nSRN performance was scored in terms of Grammatical Prediction Error (GPE; Christiansen and Chater,), which measures the network\\'s ability to make grammatically correct predictions for each upcoming word in a sentence, given prior context. The right-hand side of Figure 2 shows the mean sentence GPE scores, averaged across 10 novel sentences. Both humans and SRNs show similar qualitative patterns of processing difficulty (see also Christiansen and Chater,). At a single level of embedding, there is no difference in processing difficulty. However, at two levels of embedding, cross-dependency structures (in Dutch) are processed more easily than comparable center-embedded structures (in German).\\nChristiansen and MacDonald demonstrated that a sequence learner such as the SRN is able to mirror the differential human performance on center-embedded and cross-dependency recursive structures. Notably, the networks were able to capture human performance without the complex external memory devices (such as a stack of stacks; Joshi,) or external memory constraints (Gibson,) required by previous accounts. The SRNs ability to mimic human performance likely derives from a combination of intrinsic architectural constraints (Christiansen and Chater,) and the distributional properties of the input to which it has been exposed (MacDonald and Christiansen,; see also Christiansen and Chater, Forthcoming). Christiansen and Chater analyzed the hidden unit representations of the SRN:its internal state:before and after training on recursive constructions and found that these networks have an architectural bias toward local dependencies, corresponding to those found in right-branching recursion. To process multiple instances of such recursive constructions, however, the SRN needs exposure to the relevant types of recursive structures. This exposure is particularly important when the network has to process center-embedded constructions because the network must overcome its architectural bias toward local dependencies. Thus, recursion is not a built-in property of the SRN; instead, the networks develop their human-like abilities for processing recursive constructions through repeated exposure to the relevant structures in the input.\\nAs noted earlier, this usage-based approach to recursion differs from many previous processing accounts, in which unbounded recursion is implemented as part of the representation of linguistic knowledge (typically in the form of a rule-based grammar). Of course, this means that systems of the latter kind can process complex recursive constructions, such as center-embeddings, beyond human capabilities. Since Miller and Chomsky, the solution to this mismatch has been to impose extrinsic memory limitations exclusively aimed at capturing human performance limitations on doubly center-embedded constructions (e.g., Kimball,; Marcus,; Church,; Just and Carpenter,; Stabler,; Gibson and Thomas,; Gibson,; see Lewis et al.,, for a review).\\nTo further investigate the nature of the SRN\\'s intrinsic constraints on the processing of multiple center-embedded constructions, Christiansen and MacDonald explored a previous result from Christiansen and Chater showing that SRNs found ungrammatical versions of doubly center-embedded sentences with a missing verb more acceptable than their grammatical counterparts5 (for similar SRN results, see Engelmann and Vasishth,). A previous offline rating study by Gibson and Thomas found that when the middle verb phrase (was cleaning every week) was removed from (10), the resulting ungrammatical sentence in (11) was rated no worse than the grammatical version in (10).\\n(10) The apartment that the maid who the service had sent over was cleaning every week was well decorated.\\n(11) *The apartment that the maid who the service had sent over was well decorated.\\nHowever, when Christiansen and MacDonald tested the SRN on similar doubly center-embedded constructions, they obtained predictions for (11) to be rated better than (10). To test these predictions, they elicited on-line human ratings for the stimuli from the Gibson and Thomas study using a variation of the \"stop making sense\" sentence-judgment paradigm (Boland et al.,; Boland,). Participants read a sentence, word-by-word, while at each step they decided whether the sentence was grammatical or not. Following the presentation of each sentence, participants rated it on a 7-point scale according to how good it seemed to them as a grammatical sentence of English (with 1 indicating that the sentence was \"perfectly good English\" and 7 indicating that it was \"really bad English\"). As predicted by the SRN, participants rated ungrammatical sentences such as (11) as better than their grammatical counterpart exemplified in (10).\\nThe original stimuli from the Gibson and Thomas study had certain shortcomings that could have affected the outcome of the online rating experiment. Firstly, there were substantial length differences between the ungrammatical and grammatical versions of a given sentence. Secondly, the sentences incorporated semantic biases making it easier to line up a subject noun with its respective verb (e.g., apartment-decorated, service-sent over in 10). To control for these potential confounds, Christiansen and MacDonald replicated the experiment using semantically-neutral stimuli controlled for length (adapted from Stolz,), as illustrated by (12) and (13).\\n(12) The chef who the waiter who the busboy offended appreciated admired the musicians.\\n(13) *The chef who the waiter who the busboy offended frequently admired the musicians.\\nThe second online rating experiment yielded the same results as the first, thus replicating the \"missing verb\" effect. These results have subsequently been confirmed by online ratings in French (Gimenes et al.,) and a combination of self-paced reading and eye-tracking experiments in English (Vasishth et al.,). However, evidence from German (Vasishth et al.,) and Dutch (Frank et al.,) indicates that speakers of these languages do not show the missing verb effect but instead find the grammatical versions easier to process. Because verb-final constructions are common in German and Dutch, requiring the listener to track dependency relations over a relatively long distance, substantial prior experience with these constructions likely has resulted in language-specific processing improvements (see also Engelmann and Vasishth,; Frank et al.,, for similar perspectives). Nonetheless, in some cases the missing verb effect may appear even in German, under conditions of high processing load (Trotzke et al.,). Together, the results from the SRN simulations and human experimentation support our hypothesis that the processing of center-embedded structures are best explained from a usage-based perspective that emphasizes processing experience with the specific statistical properties of individual languages. Importantly, as we shall see next, such linguistic experience interacts with sequence learning constraints.\\nPrevious studies have suggested that the processing of singly embedded relative clauses are determined by linguistic experience, mediated by sequence learning skills (e.g., Wells et al.,; Misyak et al.,; see Christiansen and Chater, Forthcoming, for discussion). Can our limited ability to process multiple complex recursive embeddings similarly be shown to reflect constraints on sequence learning? The embedding of multiple complex recursive structures:whether in the form of center-embeddings or cross-dependencies:results in several pairs of overlapping non-adjacent dependencies (as illustrated by Figure 1). Importantly, the SRN simulation results reported above suggest that a sequence learner might also be able to deal with the increased difficulty associated with multiple, overlapping non-adjacent dependencies.\\nDealing appropriately with multiple non-adjacent dependencies may be one of the key defining characteristics of human language. Indeed, when a group of generativists and cognitive linguists recently met to determine what is special about human language (Tallerman et al.,), one of the few things they could agree about was that long-distance dependencies constitute one of the hallmarks of human language, and not recursion (contra Hauser et al.,). de Vries et al. used a variation of the AGL-SRT task (Misyak et al.,) to determine whether the limitations on processing of multiple non-adjacent dependencies might depend on general constraints on human sequence learning, instead of being unique to language. This task incorporates the structured, probabilistic input of artificial grammar learning (AGL; e.g., Reber,) within a modified two-choice serial reaction-time (SRT; Nissen and Bullemer,) layout. In the de Vries et al. study, participants used the computer mouse to select one of two written words (a target and a foil) presented on the screen as quickly as possible, given auditory input. Stimuli consisted of sequences with two or three non-adjacent dependencies, ordered either using center-embeddings or cross-dependencies. The dependencies were instantiated using a set of dependency pairs that were matched for vowel sounds: ba-la, yo-no, mi-di, and wu-tu. Examples of each of the four types of stimuli are presented in (14-17), where the subscript numbering indicates dependency relationships.\\n(14) ba1 wu2 tu2 la1\\n(15) ba1 wu2 la1 tu2\\n(16) ba1 wu2 yo3 no3 tu2 la1\\n(17) ba1 wu2 yo3 la1 tu2 no3\\nThus, (14) and (16) implement center-embedded recursive structure and (15) and (17) involve cross-dependencies. Participants would only be exposed to one of the four types of stimuli. To determine the potential effect of linguistic experience on the processing of complex recursive sequence structure, study participants were either native speakers of German (which has center-embedding but not cross-dependencies) or Dutch (which has cross-dependencies). Participants were only exposed to one kind of stimulus, e.g., doubly center-embedded sequences as in (16) in a fully crossed design (length x embedding x native language).\\nde Vries et al. first evaluated learning by administering a block of ungrammatical sequences in which the learned dependencies were violated. As expected, the ungrammatical block produced a similar pattern of response slow-down for both for both center-embedded and cross-dependency items involving two non-adjacent dependencies (similar to what Bach et al.,, Bach et al., found in the natural language case). However, an analog of the missing verb effect was observed for the center-embedded sequences with three non-adjacencies but not for the comparable cross-dependency items. Indeed, an incorrect middle element in the center-embedded sequences (e.g., where tu is replaced by la in 16) did not elicit any slow-down at all, indicating that participants were not sensitive to violations at this position.\\nSequence learning was further assessed using a prediction task at the end of the experiment (after a recovery block of grammatical sequences). In this task, participants would hear a beep replacing one of the elements in the second half of the sequence and were asked to simply click on the written word that they thought had been replaced. Participants exposed to the sequences incorporating two dependencies, performed reasonably well on this task, with no difference between center-embedded and cross-dependency stimuli. However, as for the response times, a missing verb effect was observed for the center-embedded sequences with three non-adjacencies. When the middle dependent element was replaced by a beep in center-embedded sequences (e.g., ba1 wu2 yo3 no3<beep> la1), participants were more likely to click on the foil (e.g., la) than the target (tu). This was not observed for the corresponding cross-dependency stimuli, once more mirroring the Bach et al. psycholinguistic results that multiple cross-dependencies are easier to process than multiple center-embeddings.\\nContrary to psycholinguistic studies of German (Vasishth et al.,) and Dutch (Frank et al.,), de Vries et al. found an analog of the missing verb effect in speakers of both languages. Because the sequence-learning task involved non-sense syllables, rather than real words, it may not have tapped into the statistical regularities that play a key role in real-life language processing6. Instead, the results reveal fundamental limitations on the learning and processing of complex recursively structured sequences. However, these limitations may be mitigated to some degree, given sufficient exposure to the \"right\" patterns of linguistic structure:including statistical regularities involving morphological and semantic cues:and thus lessening sequence processing constraints that would otherwise result in the missing verb effect for doubly center-embedded constructions. Whereas the statistics of German and Dutch appear to support such amelioration of language processing, the statistical make-up of linguistic patterning in English and French apparently does not. This is consistent with the findings of Frank et al., demonstrating that native Dutch and German speakers show a missing verb effect when processing English (as a second language), even though they do not show this effect in their native language (except under extreme processing load, Trotzke et al.,). Together, this pattern of results suggests that the constraints on human processing of multiple long-distance dependencies in recursive constructions stem from limitations on sequence learning interacting with linguistic experience.\\nIn this extended case study, we argued that our ability to process of recursive structure does not rely on recursion as a property of the grammar, but instead emerges gradually by piggybacking on top of domain-general sequence learning abilities. Evidence from genetics, comparative work on non-human primates, and cognitive neuroscience suggests that humans have evolved complex sequence learning skills, which were subsequently pressed into service to accommodate language. Constraints on sequence learning therefore have played an important role in shaping the cultural evolution of linguistic structure, including our limited abilities for processing recursive structure. We have shown how this perspective can account for the degree to which humans are able to process complex recursive structure in the form of center-embeddings and cross-dependencies. Processing limitations on recursive structure derive from constraints on sequence learning, modulated by our individual native language experience.\\nWe have taken the first steps toward an evolutionarily-informed usage-based account of recursion, where our recursive abilities are acquired piecemeal, construction by construction, in line with developmental evidence. This perspective highlights the key role of language experience in explaining cross-linguistic similarities and dissimilarities in the ability to process different types of recursive structure. And although, we have focused on the important role of sequence learning in explaining the limitations of human recursive abilities, we want to stress that language processing, of course, includes other domain-general factors. Whereas distributional information clearly provides important input to language acquisition and processing, it is not sufficient, but must be complemented by numerous other sources of information, from phonological and prosodic cues to semantic and discourse information (e.g., Christiansen and Chater,, Forthcoming). Thus, our account is far from complete but it does offer the promise of a usage-based perspective of recursion based on evolutionary considerations.\\nIn this paper, we have argued that there are theoretical reasons to suppose that special-purpose biological machinery for language can be ruled out on evolutionary grounds. A possible counter-move adopted by the minimalist approach to language is to suggest that the faculty of language is very minimal and only consists of recursion (e.g., Hauser et al.,; Chomsky,). However, we have shown that capturing human performance on recursive constructions does not require an innate mechanism for recursion. Instead, we have suggested that the variation in processing of recursive structures as can be observed across individuals, development and languages is best explained by domain-general abilities for sequence learning and processing interacting with linguistic experience. But, if this is right, it becomes crucial to provide explanations for the puzzling aspects of language that were previously used to support the case for a rich innate language faculty: (1) the poverty of the stimulus, (2) the eccentricity of language, (3) language universals, (4) the source of linguistic regularities, and (5) the uniqueness of human language. In the remainder of the paper, we therefore address each of these five challenges, in turn, suggesting how they may be accounted for without recourse to anything more than domain-general constraints.\\nOne traditional motivation for postulating an innate language faculty is the assertion that there is insufficient information in the child\\'s linguistic environment for reliable language acquisition to be possible (Chomsky,). If the language faculty has been pared back to consist only of a putative mechanism for recursion, then this motivation no longer applies:the complex patterns in language which have been thought to pose challenges of learnability concern highly specific properties of language (e.g., concerning binding constraints), which are not resolved merely by supplying the learner with a mechanism for recursion.\\nBut recent work provides a positive account of how the child can acquire language, in the absence of an innate language faculty, whether minimal or not. One line of research has shown, using computational results from language corpora and mathematical analysis, that learning methods are much more powerful than had previously been assumed (e.g., Manning and Schutze,; Klein and Manning,; Chater and Vitanyi,; Hsu et al.,; Chater et al.,). But more importantly, viewing language as a culturally evolving system, shaped by the selectional pressures from language learners, explains why language and languages learners fit together so closely. In short, the remarkable phenomenon of language acquisition from a noisy and partial linguistic input arises from a close fit between the structure of language and the structure of the language learner. However, the origin of this fit is not that the learner has somehow acquired a special-purpose language faculty embodying universal properties of human languages, but, instead, because language has been subject to powerful pressures of cultural evolution to match, as well as possible, the learning and processing mechanism of its speakers (e.g., as suggested by Reali and Christiansen\\'s,, simulations). In short, the brain is not shaped for language; language is shaped by the brain (Christiansen and Chater,).\\nLanguage acquisition can overcome the challenges of the poverty of the stimulus without recourse to an innate language faculty, in light both of new results on learnability, and the insight that language has been shaped through processes of cultural evolution to be as learnable as possible.\\nFodor argue that the generalizations found in language are so different from those evident in other cognitive domains, that they can only be subserved by highly specialized cognitive mechanisms. But the cultural evolutionary perspective that we have outlined here suggests, instead, that the generalizations observed in language are not so eccentric after all: they arise, instead, from a wide variety of cognitive, cultural, and communicative constraints (e.g., as exemplified by our extended case study of recursion). The interplay of these constraints, and the contingencies of many thousands of years of cultural evolution, is likely to have resulted in the apparently baffling complexity of natural languages.\\nAnother popular motivation for proposing an innate language faculty is to explain putatively universal properties across all human languages. Such universals can be explained as consequences of the innate language faculty:and variation between languages has often been viewed as relatively superficial, and perhaps as being determined by the flipping of a rather small number of discrete \"switches,\" which differentiate English, Hopi and Japanese (e.g., Lightfoot,; Baker,; Yang,).\\nBy contrast, we see \"universals\" as products of the interaction between constraints deriving from the way our thought processes work, from perceptuo-motor factors, from cognitive limitations on learning and processing, and from pragmatic sources. This view implies that most universals are unlikely to be found across all languages; rather, \"universals\" are more akin to statistical trends tied to patterns of language use. Consequently, specific universals fall on a continuum, ranging from being attested to only in some languages to being found across most languages. An example of the former is the class of implicational universals, such as that verb-final languages tend to have postpositions (Dryer,), whereas the presence of nouns and verbs (minimally as typological prototypes; Croft,) in most, though perhaps not all (Evans and Levinson,), languages is an example of the latter.\\nIndividual languages, on our account, are seen as evolving under the pressures from multiple constraints deriving from the brain, as well as cultural-historical factors (including language contact and sociolinguistic influences), resulting over time in the breathtaking linguistic diversity that characterize the about 6-8000 currently existing languages (see also Dediu et al.,). Languages variously employ tones, clicks, or manual signs to signal differences in meaning; some languages appear to lack the noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a proliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some languages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole sentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). Cross-linguistically recurring patterns do emerge due to similarity in constraints and culture/history, but such patterns should be expected to be probabilistic tendencies, not the rigid properties of a universal grammar (Christiansen and Chater,). From this perspective it seems unlikely that the world\\'s languages will fit within a single parameterized framework (e.g., Baker,), and more likely that languages will provide a diverse, and somewhat unruly, set of solutions to a hugely complex problem of multiple constraint satisfaction, as appears consistent with research on language typology (Comrie,; Evans and Levinson,; Evans,). Thus, we construe recurring patterns of language along the lines of Wittgenstein\\'s notion of \"family resemblance\": although there may be similarities between pairs of individual languages, there is no single set of features common to all.\\nEven if the traditional conception of language universals is too strict, the challenge remains: in the absence of a language faculty, how can we explain why language is orderly at all? How is it that the processing of myriads of different constructions have not created a chaotic mass of conflicting conventions, but a highly, if partially, structured system linking form and meaning?\\nThe spontaneous creation of tracks in a forest provides an interesting analogy (Christiansen and Chater,). Each time an animal navigates through the forest, it is concerned only with reaching its immediate destination as easily as possible. But the cumulative effect of such navigating episodes, in breaking down vegetation and gradually creating a network of paths, is by no means chaotic. Indeed, over time, we may expect the pattern of tracks to become increasingly ordered: kinks will be become straightened; paths between ecological salient locations (e.g., sources of food, shelter or water) will become more strongly established; and so on. We might similarly suspect that language will become increasingly ordered over long periods of cultural evolution.\\nWe should anticipate that such order should emerge because the cognitive system does not merely learn lists of lexical items and constructions by rote; it generalizes from past cases to new cases. To the extent that the language is a disordered morass of competing and inconsistent regularities, it will be difficult to process and difficult to learn. Thus, the cultural evolution of language, both within individuals and across generations of learners, will impose a strong selection pressure on individual lexical items and constructions to align with each other. Just as stable and orderly forest tracks emerge from the initially arbitrary wanderings of the forest fauna, so an orderly language may emerge from what may, perhaps, have been the rather limited, arbitrary and inconsistent communicative system of early \"proto-language.\" In particular, for example, the need to convey an unlimited number of messages will lead to a drive to recombine linguistic elements is systematic ways, yielding increasingly \"compositional\" semantics, in which the meaning of a message is associated with the meaning of its parts, and the way in which they are composed together (e.g., Kirby,).\\nThere appears to be a qualitative difference between communicative systems employed by non-human animals, and human natural language: one possible explanation is that humans, alone, possess an innate faculty for language. But human \"exceptionalism\" is evident in many domains, not just in language; and, we suggest, there is good reason to suppose that what makes humans special concerns aspect of our cognitive and social behavior, which evolved prior to the emergence of language, but made possible the collective construction of natural languages through long processes of cultural evolution.\\nA wide range of possible cognitive precursors for language have been proposed. For example, human sequence processing abilities for complex patterns, described above, appear significantly to outstrip processing abilities of non-human animals (e.g., Conway and Christiansen,). Human articulatory machinery may be better suited to spoken language than that of other apes (e.g., Lieberman,). And the human abilities to understand the minds of others (e.g., Call and Tomasello,) and to share attention (e.g., Knoblich et al.,) and to engage in joint actions (e.g., Bratman,), may all be important precursors for language.\\nNote, though, that from the present perspective, language is continuous with other aspects of culture:and almost all aspects of human culture, from music and art to religious ritual and belief, moral norms, ideologies, financial institutions, organizations, and political structures are uniquely human. It seems likely that such complex cultural forms arise through long periods of cultural innovation and diffusion, and that the nature of such propagation depends will depend on a multitude of historical, sociological, and, most likely, a host of cognitive factors (e.g., Tomasello,; Richerson and Christiansen,). Moreover, we should expect that different aspects of cultural evolution, including the evolution of language, will be highly interdependent. In the light of these considerations, once the presupposition that language is sui generis and rooted in a genetically-specified language faculty is abandoned, there seems little reason to suppose that there will be a clear-cut answer concerning the key cognitive precursors for human language, any more than we should expect to be able to enumerate the precursors of cookery, dancing, or agriculture.\\nPrior to the seismic upheavals created by the inception of generative grammar, language was generally viewed as a paradigmatic, and indeed especially central, element of human culture. But the meta-theory of the generative approach was taken to suggest a very different viewpoint: that language is primarily a biological, rather than a cultural, phenomenon: the knowledge of the language was seen not as embedded in a culture of speakers and hearers, but primarily in a genetically-specified language faculty.\\nWe suggest that, in light of the lack of a plausible evolutionary origin for the language faculty, and a re-evaluation of the evidence for even the most minimal element of such a faculty, the mechanism of recursion, it is time to return to viewing language as a cultural, and not a biological, phenomenon. Nonetheless, we stress that, like other aspects of culture, language will have been shaped by human processing and learning biases. Thus, understanding the structure, acquisition, processing, and cultural evolution of natural language requires unpicking how language has been shaped by the biological and cognitive properties of the human brain.\\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.',\n",

He was a full-time resident at an assisted living nursing home, and his baseline mental status was awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time (AAOx3). Upon arrival in the emergency department, he was oriented only to self. Prior to this admission, the patient was being treated for a urinary tract infection and was on day seven of nitrofurantoin and cefepime. On examination, he was hypotensive at a blood pressure of 81/59 mmHg, pulse rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 78% while breathing ambient air. He was in visible respiratory distress and was lethargic, but arousable. He received a nebulizer treatment and was placed on a non-rebreather mask at 6 liters, after which his oxygen saturation rose to 99%. A chest X-ray was taken and revealed left lower lobe pneumonia. His urinalysis was positive for an infection despite current antibiotic compliance. He began vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for health care-associated pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Respiratory status worsened, and he required intubation.\\nDespite these interventions, on his second day of admission, he continued to have copious clear secretions. Pulmonology diagnosed him with aspiration pneumonia and sputum cultures were obtained, which demonstrated moderate white blood cells, rare epithelial cells, few Gram-positive cocci in clusters, and rare yeast. His antibiotics were adjusted for sensitivities to vancomycin and meropenem. To further evaluate his ongoing pulmonary issues, a chest CT scan was obtained, revealing increasing bilateral pleural effusions and patchy sclerotic foci concerning for possible bone metastases, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and nodular infiltrate in the right mid- and upper lung fields. Gastroenterology was consulted for colonoscopy to identify a primary tumor, but the patient was deemed too unstable for a nonemergent procedure. Thoracocentesis revealed exudative pleural effusions negative for malignancy. Abdominal and pelvic CT demonstrated hydronephrosis and a right-sided staghorn renal calculus but no masses.\\nWith these interventions, our patient began to improve, yet daily sedation interruptions and spontaneous breathing trials failed. Initial blood culture results showed Gram-positive bacilli, and further speciation of the organism was requested. On day 13, blood cultures were finalized and grew Clostridium subterminale. Sputum and stool testing showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile, so metronidazole was started. Gastroenterology again stated that the patient was too unstable for colonoscopy and suggested a bone biopsy, which he underwent the following day. The preliminary pathology report stated that the bone biopsy was likely malignant adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed on hospital day 21. Biopsy indicated that the tumor was positive for markers CK7 and CA19-9; primary sites with this immunophenotypic profile include the upper GI tract and pancreaticobiliary system. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated at 73.8 (normal CEA nonsmokers < 5.1; smokers < 6.6) and CA19-9 was 3,146 (normal < 45). Per oncology, he was not a candidate for any interventions due to his comorbidities.\\nOn day 23, he had increasing secretions and was agitated despite completion of his antibiotic course. The patient's three daughters decided on terminal extubation, and comfort measures were initiated. At 21 : 12 on hospital day 23, the patient was pronounced dead.\",\n",

He also developed Kluyvera bacteremia followed by VRE bacteremia.\\nFour months after transplant, the patient presented with altered mental status and severe volume overload. On admission, the patient was lethargic, afebrile, and normotensive but tachycardic. Physical examination revealed severe anasarca and asterixis with no focal deficit. Diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy was entertained. Urgent hemodialysis for uremia was started. His lactulose was increased for presumed hepatic encephalopathy without any improvement.\\nOn the 5th hospital day, the patient suddenly became unresponsive, hypotensive with shock, hypoxic, and febrile. He was intubated and started on vasopressors. Chest X-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation, but did not reveal cardiomegaly. His ECG showed diffuse ST segment elevations. PR segment depressions, electrical alternans, and low QRS voltage were absent. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate size pericardial effusion localized circumferentially. This was accompanied by right ventricular compression with tamponade physiology. The patient had emergent pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement. A total of 320 ml of purulent fluid was drained. His blood pressure improved and he was taken off vasopressors. He was also started on daptomycin and cefepime.\\nOn the 6th hospital day, the patient continued to be lethargic. A CT scan of the head showed evidence of multifocal infarctions. Subsequent MRI of the brain revealed multiple septic emboli (Figure 1). These results raised suspicion of infective endocarditis for which a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed. TEE showed possible small mitral valve vegetations (Figure 2) and resolution of the pericardial effusion. Blood cultures grew vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The hemodialysis catheter was changed over the wire and culture of the catheter tip was subsequently found to be negative. Cefepime was switched to ceftaroline for better daptomycin binding to bacterial membrane.\\nOn the 7th hospital day, mold grew in pericardial fluid culture. Amphotericin B was initiated to cover both Aspergillus and Mucor. The patient continued to clinically deteriorate and went into septic shock. The family gave him a do-not-resuscitate status and he expired on the 7th hospital day. The mold was eventually identified as Aspergillus fumigatus 10 days after the patient died.\\nCardiac aspergillosis remains a diagnostic challenge especially without prior established pulmonary aspergillosis. A high degree clinical suspicion on an immunocompromised patient is needed to direct the clinical investigation. There are currently thirty-two cases of pericardial aspergillosis found in literature. Eight had clinical signs of cardiac tamponade. Only three, including our case, did not have established pulmonary or other forms of aspergillosis. Most diagnoses were postmortem. Only six out of the thirty-two were cured.\\nAmong patients predisposed to aspergillosis, cancer is the most common underlying medical condition (44%), followed by bone marrow transplant (25%), solid-organ transplant (13%), HIV/AIDS (3.8), autoimmune (2%), and systemic steroid use (3.5%). Our patient is a renal transplant patient with concurrent immunosuppressant use. His clinical course was complicated by acute decompensated liver cirrhosis, acute renal allograft dysfunction, and severe infections within two months of renal transplant. These extensive comorbidities made him susceptible to opportunistic infections. Four months after his renal transplant, he had aspergillosis pericarditis with tamponade that eventually led to his demise.\\nWeiland et al. studied the clinical pattern of aspergillosis in renal transplant patients. The median time between aspergillosis infection and transplantation was found to be three and a half months. For patients with history of acute rejection, aspergillosis occurred within two months of treatment of acute rejection. These data are consistent with the clinical course of our patient. Weiland et al. also found that aspergillosis took place alongside other illnesses. The most common associated infection was CMV followed by bacterial infections. One-fourth of patients affected were also multiple transplant recipients. Weiland et al. concluded that for renal transplant patients, patients with CMV, recent acute rejection and recipients of multiple transplants appear to be more susceptible to aspergillosis.\\nThe clinical features of cardiac aspergillosis are nonspecific and often depend on which part of the heart is involved. Myocardial aspergillosis is the most common form of the infection and can account to up to 83% of cases. It may occur alone but often with endocarditis or pericarditis. It is often asymptomatic, although it can manifest as a conduction abnormality and is usually diagnosed during autopsy.\\nAspergillosis endocarditis occurs in 17% of patients and presents as fever, embolic episodes, or heart murmur. Unlike Aspergillus endocarditis where large vegetations are easily seen in echocardiography, myocardial or pericardial aspergillosis are harder to detect. Our patient had septic emboli to the brain, a frequent sequelae of endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiogram did reveal possible small valvular vegetations. This shows that the patient may have accompanying infective endocarditis. Embolic events in the setting of aspergillosis without significant valvular vegetations may also signify mural endocarditis. Aspergillus mural endocarditis is not always apparent in echocardiograms and may start off as a subendocardial focus before developing into an abscess.\\n Aspergillus is difficult to grow in blood cultures. Our hospital uses Bactec Fx culture system and requires 5-7 ml of blood sample per culture bottle. In this patient, a bottle of blood culture on admission did not grow any organism. On day 5, when the patient was clinically deteriorating, repeat blood cultures consisting of two bottles only grew Enterococcus faecium. On day 6, repeat blood cultures again showed no growth in one bottle and E. faecium in the second bottle. It was only in the pericardial fluid fungal culture collected on day 5 that Aspergillus fumigatus was demonstrated and grown.\\n Aspergillus pericarditis occurs in multisite infections and is seen in 17% of cardiac aspergillosis. It presents as chest pain, hypotension, tamponade, or pericardial friction rub. In our patient, diffuse ST segment elevations and hypotension pointed towards cardiac tamponade. Before this, his lethargy was attributed to metabolic encephalopathy. The patient, however, quickly deteriorated and eventually expired.\\nThe initial therapy for invasive aspergillosis is voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal. It has been shown to be more effective than amphotericin B and is associated with lower mortality rate. Our patient, on the other hand, was started on amphotericin B when pericardial fluid revealed mold. This is to cover for both Aspergillus and Mucor. Mucor is another mold infection that occurs in transplant patients and voriconazole does not have anti-Mucor activity. Furthermore, for patients who have liver disease like ours or for patients who cannot tolerate voriconazole, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B is the next alternative to voriconazole.\\nOther treatment strategies involve combination therapy of voriconazole and echinocandins. The combination therapy may be used as primary treatment or as salvage therapy. The dual therapy was shown to have superior outcomes than voriconazole alone in one study. Echinocandins, however, are not used as initial monotherapy of aspergillosis. They can be used as salvage therapy for those who cannot tolerate or are refractory to triazoles.\\nInvasive aspergillosis portends a poor prognosis and has a case fatality rate (CFR) of 58%. The CFR for liver transplant patients is 67.6, while kidney transplant patients' CFR is 62.5%. For pericardial aspergillosis, only six out of thirty-two patients of the cases published in literature have been cured. Factors that contributed to the survival of the six patients were early detection, recovery from immunosuppression, pericardiectomy, and combination antifungal therapy.\\nIn conclusion, pericardial aspergillosis is a rare and fatal disease in immunosuppressed patients. It is often insidious and has nonspecific clinical manifestations. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required for early detection and diagnosis. Once diagnosed, aggressive treatment is warranted.\",\n",

The patient was being maintained on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone for immunosuppression (Table 1). Due to loss of previous graft from rejection, she was maintained on a high-dose triple drug immunosuppressive regimen to prevent recurrence of rejection. One month prior to diagnosis, she presented with acute left leg pain and swelling felt to be secondary to chronic pain from hardware repair of extremity several years ago. She continued to experience extremity pain and was subsequently admitted. On this admission, the patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for fasciotomy (Figure 1). No necrotic tissue was found, and she was sent home with a wound vacuum. Upon follow-up with her outpatient wound clinic, fat necrosis was noted on the affected leg and a debridement was completed. A rapid genetic sequencing swab (MicroGen Diagnostics ) was run at the clinic showing 94% Enterococcus faecalis, 93% Rhizopus oryzae, and 5% Aspergillus flavus. The patient presented to our hospital for further work up of polymicrobial infection and potential invasive fungal disease.\\nOn hospital day 2, she was started on intravenous (IV) isavuconazole 372 mg daily and returned to the OR for debridement. Preliminary tissue, fungal, and anaerobic culture reports from the OR grew diphtheroids, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, and an unidentified mould. On hospital day 5, the cultures identified the mould as Rhizopus spp. Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/kg daily was added. The same day she went back to the OR for debridement, and a biopsy sample was sent to pathology. The pathology report confirmed organisms consistent with mucormycosis. On hospital day 15, she went back to the OR for another serial debridement and biopsy. That same day, fungal susceptibilities returned, displaying isavuconazole resistance (Table 2). She was switched to oral posaconazole 300 mg daily and IV micafungin 150 mg daily in addition to amphotericin B. Three days later, her wound vacuum was replaced, and the pathology report showed multifocal fungal elements seen on a Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver stain consistent with clinical history of 'Mucor/Rhizopus.' There was necrotic tissue with no definite involvement of vessels or margins. Dermal and subcutaneous tissue displayed necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrosis, granulation tissue, and foreign body giant cell reaction. The wound vacuum was left in place, and on hospital day 20, another wound culture grew mould. At this point, given the aggressive nature of the disease, it was decided to utilize amphotericin B deoxycholate irrigation in the wound vacuum and continue systemic antimicrobials. Amphotericin B 50 mg in 1000 mL sterile water for irrigation was added to the Veraflo  wound vacuum, and pulse lavages were administered to the affected area twice daily. Nine days later, the patient went back to the OR for another debridement and repeat pathology report from that sample showed no evidence of fungus. The patient received amphotericin wound vacuum irrigation with pulse lavages for a total of 20 days. She was discharged on oral posaconazole 300 mg every 8 hours and ascorbic acid 1000 mg tablet daily to help with absorption and therapeutic drug monitoring (Table 3) with plans to follow-up for the skin graft of the area.

MELD-Na at time of transplant was 42. There were no immediate complications that occurred throughout the procedure. Immunosuppression consisting of a corticosteroid taper, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (Table 1) was started on day of transplant per institution protocol. Infection prophylaxis consisted of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (POD3), valganciclovir (POD1), and voriconazole (started 5 days prior to transplantation per protocol for high MELD-Na pretransplant patients in intensive care units).\\nOn POD10, department of infectious diseases was consulted for persistent leukocytosis and abdominal cramping. Notable findings included an endoscopy exhibiting ulcerations and old blood on POD18 and an indium scan exhibiting increased uptake in the abdomen; however, leukocytosis resolved and the patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. Patient was then readmitted on POD30 for increased abdominal pain, and a computed tomography (CT) scan exhibited free air in her abdomen suspicious for gastric perforation (Figure 2). The patient was emergently taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy with findings of a large necrotic ulcer in the antrum causing spillage of gastric contents. An OR biopsy sample resulted in Rhizopus spp., and on POD33, the patient was initiated on IV liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/kg daily, micafungin 150 mg daily, and isavuconazole 372 mg every 8 hours. After 48 hours of therapy, the patient was transitioned from isavuconazole 372 mg every 8 hours to daily. In conjunction with the antifungal regimen, weekly OR debridement and washouts were performed which resulted in persistently positive margins. After two weeks of treatment (POD46), fungal susceptibilities resulted exhibiting azole resistance with amphotericin B minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 mcg/mL (Table 4). Due to these results, amphotericin B was increased to 5 mg/kg and oral terbinafine 500 mg every 12 hours was added. Additionally, liposomal amphotericin B 250 mg/500 mL OR irrigation dwells for 30 minutes were performed by a four-quadrant wash with abdomen oscillation with each dwell taking place 5 days a week. After a total of 8 OR amphotericin B irrigation dwell completions and continued systemic combination antifungal therapy, the patient's abdominal wall was closed on POD49. On POD53, isavuconazole was switched to IV posaconazole 300 mg every 12 hours with dose adjustments per therapeutic drug monitoring (Table 3) and nystatin 100,000 unit/mL suspension to be swallowed was added. The closure of the abdomen was complicated by dehiscence and necrotic appearing tissue at the incision site. After debridement, advancement of fasciocutaneous flap, and incisional wound vacuum placement, the amphotericin dose was transitioned to 7.5 mg/kg three times a week in preparation for discharge. Amphotericin B was continued outpatient until POD213 and posaconazole for a year from discharge. The patient remained Rhizopus spp. free at 1-year postdiagnosis.\",\n",

Due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage from ongoing coagulopathy, the patient's abdomen was packed with a planned second operation for completion of the biliary anastomosis on POD2. Immunosuppression with a corticosteroid taper, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil was started on the day of transplant per institution protocol (Table 1). Infection prophylaxis consisted of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (POD3), valganciclovir (POD1), and voriconazole (started 24 days prior to transplant). Hepatitis B total core antibody resulted positive, and tenofovir disoproxil was initiated POD6.\\nOn POD6, empiric antimicrobials were broadened in response to increased leukocytosis. A minibronchoalveolar lavage was performed on POD8, and cultures resulted mould on POD 10. Prophylactic voriconazole was increased to treatment dosing, and inhaled amphotericin B was started. POD12 observation of a lesion on the patient's nose raised suspicion for mucormycosis, and that same day, the cultures resulted in Rhizopus spp. Triple antifungal therapy was initiated (IV liposomal amphotericin B 7.5 mg/kg, posaconazole 300 mg every 12 hours, and micafungin 150 mg daily). MRI findings showed persistent marked pansinusitis with focal left nasal bridge ulceration and extension of inflammation into the postseptal inferomedial extraconal fat of the left orbit with no acute intracranial abnormality identified (Figure 3). In POD13, the patient underwent extensive surgical intervention including a partial rhinectomy, bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery with left medial maxillectomy, resection of intranasal contents, septectomy, inferior and middle turbinate resection, bilateral ethmoidectomy, right maxillary antrostomy, and resection of left lamina papyracea (Figure 4). Multiple returns for debridement occurred until the patient was found to have extensive necrotic tissue involving the skull base. Given involvement of the skull base, further debridement was stopped as this was unresectable. Susceptibilities resulted showing azole resistance and amphotericin B MIC of 0.25 mcg/mL (Table 5). Due to limitations of further surgical debridement and continued positive biopsy samples for 5 months postdiagnosis despite triple antifungal therapy, nasal packing was impregnated with amphotericin B deoxycholate 50 mg (1 mg/mL) and exchanged every 24 hours to accomplish a higher, localized concentration to combat the lack of tissue perfusion. The amphotericin B nasal packing was in addition to the triple antifungal therapy previously described. Three weeks after initiation of amphotericin B nasal packing, an obtained biopsy sample resulted negative for invasive fungal disease. Nasal packing was discontinued 4 days after negative results, and triple antifungal therapy was continued.

She reported no back pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, or any constitutional symptoms. She was transferred to an outside hospital and underwent an MRI, which as read by an attending senior radiologist who suggested an epidural hematoma concentrated around the T4-T9 levels (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). She was reversed for an INR of 3.6 and then transferred to Albany Medical Center for further management. On examination, the patient was comfortable without any pain. She had a loss of bowel and bladder function and had no sensory or motor function below T5.

The results of published case series are shown in Table 1 .\\nMost notable are the cases with a complete remission of brain metastases. In the largest case series that included 27 patients who had asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastases, two of 20 evaluable patients had a response in the brain, with complete remission in one patient. In another case series described in two separate publications by Cappuzzo et al, eight patients with NSCLC and brain metastases were treated with gefitinib (; [a & b] ICE abs). One patient had a complete response and seven had partial responses in the brain, all within 3 months of treatment. The complete response in the brain was observed 6 weeks after treatment with gefitinib started in a patient who had completed whole-brain radiotherapy 3 months prior to the beginning of gefitinib (Figure 1). All eight patients experienced improvements in neurological and systemic symptoms.\\n described the case report of a patient who had achieved a complete response in the brain following treatment with gefitinib. This particular patient was diagnosed in July 1999 with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the left lung. In March 2001, after treatment with three different chemotherapy regimens, asymptomatic brain metastases were detected and subsequently treated with whole-brain radiotherapy. However, by October 2001 the patient's condition had deteriorated, with progressive brain metastases, and the patient was readmitted to hospital. Treatment with gefitinib started in November 2001 after which computed tomography scans showed that brain metastases had disappeared and that there was a marked regression of the lung tumour. The patient was then discharged in December 2001 and was able to resume full-time work for nearly 8 months. Two other published case reports also describe patients whose brain metastases responded to treatment. In all three of these cases, patients had worsening neurological symptoms and deteriorating performance status before treatment with gefitinib. Following treatment, a significant clinical improvement was seen in all three patients: brain metastases disappeared in the patient already described and the sizes of the other two patients' lesions decreased. Quality of life was improved in all three patients.\\nOne patient described at the ICE meeting showed good tolerance of concurrent gefitinib and radiotherapy (van Zandwijk [b], ICE abs, personal communication). In this case study, a 55-year-old male exsmoker with stage IV NSCLC and multiple pulmonary (lymphangitic) metastases developed multiple brain metastases (approximately 20 small lesions) after receiving treatment with gefitinib for >1 year (Figure 2). Radiotherapy to the brain (10 x 3 Gy) and continued treatment with gefitinib resulted in disease stabilisation and symptom improvement and the patient was able to return to work. Delayed imaging 9 months later showed almost complete resolution of the brain metastases (Figure 3). Thus, although gefitinib did not prevent the development of brain metastases, concurrent treatment with radiotherapy and gefitinib resulted in a durable clinical response.\\nIn total, 25 case reports of gefitinib use in patients with brain metastases and NSCLC were described at the ICE meeting (including the eight patients described by Cappuzzo et al) (Awada, ICE abs; Cappuzzo [a & b], ICE abs; Dieriks, ICE abs; Stein, ICE abs; de la Cruz [a & b], ICE abs; Maione, ICE abs; Martinez, ICE abs; Diaz-Canton, ICE abs; van der Kamp, ICE abs; van Zandwijk [b], ICE abs; Petruzelka [a], ICE abs; Azemar, ICE abs; Roggero, ICE abs; Kowalski, ICE abs; Martin-Algarra, ICE abs; Pavlakis, ICE abs). Of these, three patients had a complete response, 10 a partial response, eight had stable disease and four patients had progression of their brain metastases. In all of these case reports, treatment with gefitinib appears to have been well tolerated. Any reported adverse events are consistent with the adverse-event profile of gefitinib established in Phase II trials in patients with advanced NSCLC. There was also no unexpected or cumulative toxicity described for the patient who received concurrent gefitinib and radiotherapy (van Zandwijk [b], ICE abs).\",\n",

The illness began in the latter part of August 2008, initially presenting with diarrhea and fever. He was an MSM and the serology for HIV antibody was positive. He had no history of traveling abroad, alcoholism, any medication or intravenous drug use. His vital signs on admission were; conscious, blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, pulse late 146 beats/min, respiration, 45 breaths/min, saturation O2 (room air), 88% and body temperature 39 C. The notable findings of a physical examination included emaciation (BMI 16.1), oral candidasis and decreased breath sounds on the right side of his chest. A chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a large amount of right pleural effusion (Figure 1). A CT scan of the abdomen detected large liver abscess (Figure 2). The laboratory data included a leukocyte count of 10,320/muL with 89% neutrophils, 8% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL, C-reactive protein 23.6 mg/dL, aspirate aminotransferase 95 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 74 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 478 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 134 U/L, albumin 2.1 g/dL, total cholesterol 57 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 18.4 mg/dL, creatine 0.57 mg/dL and hyponatremia (123 mEq/L). The findings of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody tests were positive for enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and also based on the Western blot method. Thoracentesis revealed milk chocolate or cafe au lait colored pleural fluid (Figure 3). In an examination of the pleural fluid, cytology, bacterial culture, smear and polymerase chain reaction to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA were negative, the adenosine deaminase activity was 240 IU/L. The pleural fluid showed a cell count of 40125/mL (74.3% neutrocytes, 25.7% monocytes). Other examinations of the laboratory findings detected cysts of Entamoeba histolytica in the patient's stool. The CD4 lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood was 179/muL (repeated counts for CD4 lymphocytes ranged from 286 to 359/muL) and the amount of HIV-RNA was 3700 copies/muL (repeated counts for HIV-RNA ranged from 43,000 to 90,000 copies/mL). Although E. histolytica was not identified from the pleural fluid, antibodies (fluorescence antibody technique) against E. histolytica were demonstrated in the serum (200x). The patient was thus diagnosed to have amoebic colitis, amoebic liver abscess and amoebic empyema complicated with an HIV infection. The right side pleural effusion was drained using a chest tube and he was administered metronidazole (2250 mg/day) orally for 28 days in total. A large volume of pus was drained from the right thoracic space. A small volume remained. The right lung was re-expanded. His fever, dyspnea and general condition significantly improved thereafter. The patient was therefore administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and itraconazole to prevent fungal infections. However, he developed agranulocytosis 22 days after administration. The absolute neutrophil count was 0/muL. Agranulocytosis in this case was therefore considered to have been caused by the administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. After the discontinuation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) drug filgrastim was administered daily at a dose of 200 mug/m2 intravenously. Following 4 days of treatment with G-CSF, the patient's absolute neutrophil count was above 9/muL, while after 7 days of treatment it was 2990/muL (white blood cell count 4600/muL, neutrophils 65%). The patient did not demonstrate any further infection during the clinical course. He was discharged 45 days after admission.\",\n",

History taking revealed that she had moved from her birthplace in Kumamoto prefecture of southwestern Japan to Nagano prefecture after marriage. She had no other remarkable history of disease, transfusion, medication, or drug abuse.\\nOn presentation, patient's body temperature was 37.2 C with a heart rate of 127 bpm and peripheral artery oxygen saturation of 92% in ambient air. Her vesicular sounds decreased without crackling on chest auscultation. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly. Systemic lymphadenopathy and pretibial edema pitting were noted.\\nBlood examination (Table 1) disclosed a lymphocyte count of 680/muL and less than 1% morphological flower cells. Peripheral laboratory tests were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase, 37 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 6 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 622 U/L; total bilirubin, 1.5 mg/dL; soluble IL-2 receptor, 27,500 U/mL (normal range: 135-421 U/mL); and calcium, 12.9 mg/dL. HTLV-1 antibody was positive. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and the abdomen revealed bilateral pleural effusion and ascites with lymphadenopathy (Figure 1). Bilateral pleural effusion samples appeared chylous (Figure 2) with high triglyceride concentrations (Table 2) and class III cytology. A biopsy obtained from the right inguinal lymph node showed diffuse infiltration of moderate- to large-sized lymphoid cells with a pleomorphic nucleus and prominent nucleoli (Figure 3) that were CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD8-, CD20-, and CD21- on immunohistochemistry (Figure 4). Two monoclonal bands for HTLV-1 provirus DNA were observed in lymph node specimens by Southern blot hybridization analysis (Figure 5). Tumor cell infiltration into the bone marrow was negative in an aspiration biopsy. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having lymphomatous ATL.\\nThe clinical course of the patient is summarized in Figure 6. High-dose methylprednisolone therapy was deemed ineffective for her chylothorax since continuous pleural effusion drainage of 500 to 1,000 mL/day was necessary. The patient was soon shifted to a reduced-dose LSG15 chemotherapy regimen with prophylactic hydration, rasburicase, and bisphosphonate. After the first course of modified LSG15 (consisting of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisolone, vindesine, etoposide, ranimustine, and carboplatin), she required pleural effusion drainage of less than 200 mL/day. Her systemic lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion disappeared over the two subsequent LSG15 treatment courses as confirmed by CT and normalization of LDH and calcium levels.\",\n",

She was able to pass flatus, but with cessation of bowel movements. She was diagnosed to have ulcerative colitis (UC) in the past for which total colectomy was performed, followed by a manual side-to-end ileorectal anastomosis. She had previous episodes of partial SBO that resolved with antispasmodics and had an untreated menometrorrhagia for the past year.\\nShe was hemodynamically stable and her abdomen was not distended. Multiple scars from previous abdominal surgery were visible. There was tenderness in all four quadrants, but no signs of peritonism. No anterior wall defects were palpated. Bowel sounds were hyperactive. Parents rejected vaginal and rectal examination.\\nPlain abdominal X-ray showed multiple radiopaque shadows within the small bowel, no air-fluid levels or dilated loops. We further proceeded with plain computed tomography scan to reach to a final diagnosis of multiple enterolithiasis in the small bowel (Figure 1).\\nLaparotomy was done after 48 h of poor response to conservative management. Abdominal exploration revealed multiple dense and cohesive adhesions predominantly in the distal small bowel. An anastomotic ileorectal stricture was found, along with multiple stones. The size of the enteroliths averaging 1 cm did not allow manual \"milking\" of the stones into the rectum (Figure 2). In the pelvic cavity, a cystic mass in the left ovary was found. No communicating fistula was identified between gallbladder and duodenum. Next, left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, stricture was excised, stones were removed, and intestinal continuity restored with manual end-to-end ileorectal anastomosis at a distance of 12 cm from the anal verge. This was followed by dilation and curettage (D&C).\\nIn the post-operative period, marked malnutrition was detected with a decrease in serum albumin; for this reason, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was initiated; 5 days after ex-lap, she presented abundant discharge of succus through the wound. Urgent relaparotomy was performed. Anastomotic leak was found and was managed by dismantling of the anastomosis with closure of the rectal stump and end-ileostomy. Analysis of the biochemical composition of the intestinal stones showed the presence of calcium dihydrate oxalate (85%), calcium monohydrate oxalate (10%), and carbonate apatite (5%).

The patient mentioned a history of weight loss, decreased appetite, and generalized weakness. There was no significant medical or family history or any relevant past interventions.\\nClinical findings: the physical examination was unremarkable. The temperature was 37.3 C, blood pressure 124/84 mmHg, and pulse rate regular at 86 beats/min. In palpation, we revealed mild tenderness in the right flank but without any palpable mass.\\nDiagnostic assessment: abdominal computer tomography (CT) scan revealed a heterogeneous right renal mass measuring 86 x76x 68 mm and arising from the upper and middle pole (Figure 1), with a lymph node of 8 mm diameter detected in the renal hilum as well as a multi lithiasis gallbladder (Figure 2). Laboratory tests did not detect any alterations, and gave the following results: white blood cell count was 79.000/mm3, red blood cell count 5,3.106/mm3, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, hematocrit 39.1%, platelets 19.6 x 104/microL, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 25 IU/L, alanine transaminase 19 IU/L, albumin 4.25 g/ dL, lactate dehydrogenase 240 IU/L, beta-glutamyltransferase 27 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 201 IU/L, amylase 129 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen 11.6 mg/dL, creatinine 8 mg/L, C-reactive protein 3 mg/L, urinalysis pH 7.0, no uric protein, no urinary sugar, no ketone body, no uric blood, no bilirubin, and no white blood cell, and no bacteriuria. A chest CT was done and did not show any metastasis. The presumptive diagnosis was a renal tumor classified T2a-N2-M0, associated with a multi lithiasis gallbladder.\\nTherapeutic interventions: a right open radical nephrectomy via subcostal incision with lymph node dissection and cholecystectomy was performed. The surgical exploration showed a right renal large superior polar exophytic mass with two palpable hilar lymphadenopathies. The wall of the gallbladder appeared normal except for its lithiasis content. The surgical intervention was performed successfully without adhesion or local invasion.\\nFollow-up and outcome of interventions: the postoperative course was without complications, and the patient was uneventfully discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Pathological assessment of the specimen showed the tumor was well-circumscribed, measuring 9 x 7 x 5 cm and subtotally effacing the kidney. At sectioning, it was tan-yellow with large necrotic areas. The gallbladder was thin-walled with a 0.4 x 0.3 submucosal nodule. Microscopically the renal tumor consisted of a tubulopapillar lined by pseudostratified layers of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and high nucleolar grade. It was a clear cell RCC with the pathologic stage of pT2a, Fuhrman 3. The polypoid lesion of the gallbladder was identical to those of the renal tumor population, made up of large, plant-like cells with clear cytoplasm, adopting an acinar or solid architecture within a stroma rich in small vessels (Figure 3A, Figure 3B). Immunohistochemistry was positive for cytokeratin CK7, AMACR (a-Methylacyl Coenzyme A Racemase), cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and vimentin (Figure 3C, Figure 3D). The morphologic and phenotypic profiles were consistent with synchronous metastasis from renal carcinoma. Additionally, the histopathological study found several lymph nodes to be invaded. So, the final stage of the tumor was pT2a-N2-M1. The follow-up was carried out by CT scan at six months, and then after one year, the patient did not present a recurrence, and the renal function remained normal.\\nPatient perspective: the patient was informed about the all procedure, complication and outcome, and she was agreeing about it. The patient was pleased with the care she received throughout therapy.\\nInformed consent: written informed consent was obtained from the patient for participation in our study.',\n",

Those undertaking the evaluation are not connected with the organisations or individuals who have developed, or are in the process of developing the employability interventions so no competing interests arise. Within the CASE-study each existing or innovative intervention will be compared with usual care for work-disabled employees or those at risk of work disability due to medical restrictions. At the start of the CASE-study, nine programmes were interested in participating in the project. Unfortunately four programmes could not collaborate because they were unable to provide the minimum required number of participants eligible for the study, or could not provide a comparable control group. The remaining five employability interventions have the ability to comply to the minimal requirements and focus on primary care, secondary or specialist care, and/or on the interaction between the employer and employee. Two existing employability interventions (called 'Best Practices') and three newly developed employability interventions are included in the study. The employability intervention focussing on primary care aims to acknowledge the importance of employability in general practice. This intervention is under development at the University of Nijmegen (UMC St Radboud). The employability intervention in specialist care is being developed jointly by the VU University Medical Centre Amsterdam (VUMC) and the Institute for Health and Care Research (EMGO+) and focuses on employability among patients who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. The third newly developed intervention aims at improving the interaction between the employee and his/her employer by appointing an independent mediator. The intervention is being developed by a separate team at Maastricht University. One of the 'Best Practice' interventions, developed by Health & Motion Nederland, offers patients with physical health complaints the ability to implement a range of exercises learned at the physiotherapeutic setting in their working environment by means of a workplace-intervention. The fifth and final intervention is developed by Second Care/Care for Companies (Best Practice) and aims at achieving sustainable employability among patients with physical and/or psychological health complaints using a multidisciplinary approach. An overview of these interventions is provided in Figure 1.\\nIt is beyond the scope of this design article to describe the precise content of each employability intervention in detail. This will be done when the results of the economic evaluation per employability intervention are published. What is of importance in this paper is that the employability interventions use an innovative, systematic approach in order to support work participation in employees with health complaints. These are innovative because both the healthcare system and the private/work life of the employees are considered in the intervention. The features of the interventions differ according to the patient population, but the aim remains the same: to reduce sickness absence and increase the potential of achieving sustainable employability.\\nThe protocol for this study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Psychology (ECP107) at Maastricht University, the Netherlands.\",\n",

Subgroup analysis considering indication for surgery revealed a statistically significant postoperative vision improvement for patients with aphakia due to complicated cataract surgery (P=0.028), subluxated IOL due to closed trauma (P=0.028), non-traumatic, non-PEX-related subluxated IOL (P=0.028), and PEX-related subluxated IOL (P=0.043). Visual improvement was noted for patients in the remaining subgroups, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Subgroups of silicone-induced IOL opacification and aphakia post-endophthalmitis included a single eye, and statistical significance could not be calculated.\\nDuring the study period, 1 eye (2.7%) had postoperative visual deterioration of 2 lines in the Snellen chart, and 7 eyes (21.6%) had no change in VA.\\nThere were 3 eyes (8.1%) with reported intraoperative complications: one iatrogenic retinal hole done during vitrectomy; a flat peripherical serous choroidal detachment; and an intraoperative vitreous hemorrhage.\\nPostoperative complications included ocular hypertension (27.0%; n = 10), transient corneal edema (18.9%; n = 7), cystoid macular edema (18.9%, n = 7), self-limited hypotension (5.4%, n = 2), self-limited vitreous hemorrhage (2.7%, n = 1), one case of central retinal vein occlusion (2.7%), one case of late retinal detachment (2.7%), and one case of Akreos IOL opacification (2.7%). Retinal detachment was managed with PPV with gas endotamponade; Akreos opacification is awaiting surgery to replace the IOL; the central retinal vein occlusion has been receiving intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab and 2 cases of macular edema resolved after intravitreal injections of corticosteroids (one case with intravitreal 2 mg triamcinolone alone, and the other with 2 mg triamcinolone, followed by 0.7 mg dexamethasone intravitreal implant). All of the other complications were managed medically, with topical treatment. No suture-related complications were observed, namely, suture breakage, IOL displacements, or suture-related inflammation. Also, there were no cases of postoperative endophthalmitis, choroidal detachment, or uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome.\\nClinical outcomes are reviewed in Table 2.',\n",

He had developed productive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge three weeks before, muscle pain two weeks before, and fever and dyspnea three days before his admission. He had no medical, family, or social history of note, and no close contact with infected people. He was an ex-smoker (10 pack-years). His vital signs included a body temperature of 37.6  C, heart rate of 116 beats/min with a regular rhythm, and blood pressure of 137/84 mmHg. On physical examination, fine crackles were audible on the dorsal side of the bilateral lower lung regions, but no other remarkable findings were seen. Chest X-ray showed consolidation and reduced volume of the right lung (Fig. 1-A). Computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 2) on admission showed bilateral consolidation (right dominant), ground-glass opacities (GGOs) around the consolidations, and air-bronchogram accompanying traction bronchiectasis within the consolidations. The GGOs in part had non-segmental distribution. His arterial blood gases under ambient air showed a pH of 7.45, PaO2 of 70.2 Torr, PaCO2 of 35.7 Torr, and bicarbonate of 24.3 mmol/L, and biochemical examination of his blood and urine showed elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Pneumococcal and Legionella urinary antigen test, Mycoplasma antigen from throat swab specimens, and influenza antigen from nasal swab specimens were all negative. Autoantibodies were negative. No bacteria other than oral flora were cultured in the sputum cultures. We performed bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the right middle lobe (with 20 of 150 mL recovered). The total cell count of the BAL fluid was 5.3 x 105 cells/mL, including 44.7% lymphocytes (cluster designation [CD]4/CD8 ratio, 3.16), 7.1% eosinophils, and 23.9% neutrophils. BAL fluid yielded no bacteria, and adequate specimens for evaluation could not be collected from transbronchial lung biopsy.\\nWe diagnosed him as having CAP and started antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam + clarithromycin). Consolidation and volume reduction of the right lung continued to deteriorate, reaching a peak on the 8th day of hospitalization, but they gradually improved (Fig. 1-B, C). Serum antibody titers against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella sp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, adenovirus, human parainfluenza virus, RS virus, and influenza virus in the convalescent phase did not significantly increase compared with those measured in the acute phase. Pneumonia has not recurred as of 2 years after discharge, but the reduced volume of the right lung has remained (Fig. 1-D). Multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) with a commercially available kit (FTD Resp 21 Kit; Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta) for respiratory viruses using frozen-stored BAL fluid was performed later and was positive only for HPeV.

       "    'case_text': \"A 49-year-old Japanese woman (gravida 4, para 3) was diagnosed with AIP at the age of 27. Our patient had repeatedly visited the hospital for stomachaches beforehand; however, approximately 2 years of consultations passed before she was accurately diagnosed. Afterwards, she avoided elements known to precipitate acute attacks, and had not experienced an acute porphyria attack since she was 33 years of age. In addition, she began hypertension treatment with amlodipine besylate at the age of 40 years, and her last pregnancy had spontaneously aborted 4 years prior to the present event. In July 2011, this patient visited a local private clinic for atypical vaginal bleeding and was referred to a general hospital because of suspected spontaneous abortion. She was subsequently diagnosed with a acute intermittent porphyria hydatidiform mole via dilatation and curettage (D&C).\\nOne month after D&C, our patient presented with an elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level (Fig. 1). As fertility preservation was deemed impossible, she underwent an abdominal total hysterectomy. Pathological study of the resected specimen revealed an invasive mole, but no metastasis was observed. However, our patient's serum hCG level was again elevated 1 month after hysterectomy, and she was referred to Saitama Medical Center for chemotherapy to address expected AIP-associated complications. An X-ray computed tomography scan of her chest, performed at our institution, revealed a lung metastasis. The FIGO 2000 staging and risk factor scoring system indicated a stage III:41 gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) (Tables 1 and 2), and our patient was accordingly diagnosed with a low-risk GTN. Her treatment strategy included intramuscular MTX administration at a dose of 20 mg/day for 5 days every 2 weeks.\\nMTX chemotherapy was initiated after our patient provided informed consent, which included an understanding that MTX had not been implicated as either porphyrinogenic or nonporphyrinogenic. Our patient experienced small eruptions on the hands and epigastric region on day 3 of chemotherapy. However, a dermatologist did not interpret these eruptions as drug-related, and thus treatment was continued. On day 5, the eruptions expanded over her whole body and worsened, with ulcers developing on the oral mucosa (Fig. 2). Our patient was unable to eat or drink owing to the severe pain caused by mucosal erosion; moreover, she complained of painful micturition because of a sore on her vulva. A skin biopsy revealed drug eruption instead of a porphyric skin lesion. In particular, microabscesses had formed under the stratum corneum, with neutrophilic and eosinophilic invasion, and neutrophilic exocytosis was observed in the epidermis. Liquefaction was also observed between the epidermis and dermis, and eosinophilic, neutrophilic, and lymphocytic invasion from the layer between the epidermis and dermis to the superficial layer of the dermis was noted (Fig. 3). No changes in our patient's urinary coproporphyrin or uroporphyrin levels were observed despite the appearance of skin lesions (Fig. 1). She received intravenous prednisolone at 60 mg/day beginning on day 5 to treat the drug eruption.\\nOn day 11, our patient experienced febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] on day 8 was 1,380/muL but decreased to 12/muL on day 11) and was treated subcutaneously with 75 mug/day of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 3 days beginning on day 11. However, as she was unable to recover from neutropenia (ANC remained at 12/muL on day 13), additional subcutaneous G-CSF at 150 mug/day was administered for 2 days beginning on day 13, and her neutropenia finally resolved on day 15 (ANC, 1598/muL). During that time, her skin lesions and stomatitis also began to improve, and the prednisolone dose was reduced to 40 mg/day. As she was able to eat on day 17, oral prednisolone administration at 20 mg/day was started on day 20 and tapered on day 24. She was discharged on day 25.\\nAlthough our patient's serum hCG level decreased with MTX treatment, it became elevated during treatment interruption. Chemotherapy with ACT-D was therefore considered. After providing informed consent to ACT-D treatment and acknowledging that ACT-D was not implicated as either porphyrinogenic or nonporphyrinogenic, our patient received intravenous ACT-D at a dose of 1.5 mg/day on days 1-5 of every 2-week period, starting on day 70 of her clinical course. As shown in Fig. 1, her serum hCG level effectively decreased, and the lung metastasis disappeared without any porphyric attacks. After five cycles of ACT-D, her serum hCG level stabilized at 3.2 mIU/mL. Although other chemotherapeutic drugs were considered, a negative serum hCG level was achieved and maintained for the following 3 years.\",\n",

On jugular venous examination, giant systolic pulsations with prominent V-waves, known as the Lancisi sign or C-V waves, were noted (Fig. 1a, Video appendix 1 and 2). On auscultation, a loud first heart sound was audible, with a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound along with an apical mid-diastolic rumble. A holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that increased during inspiration was also noted. Lower limb edema, ascites and an enlarged, pulsatile liver were present. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55 % and a normal function of the mitral valve. It also confirmed the presence of a dilated right atrium and right ventricle and a severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with a moderately reduced right ventricular function. The patient was referred for a surgical tricuspid annuloplasty, but given an increased operative mortality risk refused to undergo the operation. \\nTR is a relatively common abnormality. Since this condition is frequently asymptomatic and may not be detected on routine physical examination, it is often diagnosed solely by echocardiography. Usually, there are no specific signs or symptoms. Yet, in case of severe TR, giant C-V waves or the Lancisi sign can be found on the jugular venous examination. With increasing tricuspid regurgitation, there is an increased backflow of blood to the right atrium during systole. In patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, the V wave of tricuspid regurgitation merges with the C wave forming a single prominent C-V wave that is often mistaken for the large carotid-pulse wave of severe aortic regurgitation. Other signs and symptoms include painful hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Auscultation reveals a loud first heart sound with a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, an apical mid-diastolic rumble, and a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Generally, tricuspid valve disease occurs secondary to left-sided heart valve disease, in particular mitral valve disease (i.e., functional TR) (Appendix 3). It is a marker of adverse outcome, and patients with moderate/severe TR have a worse prognosis. Primary TR (Appendix 3) is treated surgically if severe, and the patient is symptomatic. However, during concomitant left-sided heart valve surgery, a moderate/severe secondary TR with either raised pulmonary artery pressures or tricuspid annular dilatation should also be treated.',\n",

Her body height was 140 cm, and her weight was 39 kg. Tenderness was noted in the left buttock, but no lower limb muscle weakness or sensory disorders were observed. Plain radiographs showed an osteolytic lesion involving the left L5 vertebra with a winking owl sign observed on anteroposterior(AP) views (Fig. 1a). Computed tomography (CT) revealed pathological fractures of the L5 vertebral body and left pedicle along with osteolytic changes (Fig. 1b). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated lesion with fluid-fluid levels in the left vertebral arch, pedicle, and vertebral body of the L5 vertebra with high and low signal intensities on T2- and T1-weighted images, respectively. (Fig. 2a, b).\\nAn aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) of the L5 vertebra was suspected from the image findings. We performed preoperative arterial embolization of the bilateral L4 lumbar arteries and the left iliolumbar artery to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage (Fig. 3a). Using intraoperative navigation to identify tumor margins, a thorough curettage was performed to remove the tumor (Fig. 3b). Rapid intraoperative diagnosis supported the diagnosis of ABC. The final pathological diagnosis of ABC was made by confirming the fibrous connective tissue accompanied by capillary proliferation and partial fibrin deposition, with no signs of malignancy (Fig. 3c, d). Pedicle screws were inserted into L4 and S1, and an expandable cage packed with autologous bone chips was placed between the vertebral bodies to reconstruct the lumbar spine's anterior strut (Fig. 4a).\\nAfter surgery, she had complete pain relief. At two years follow up, CT and MRI showed no apparent signs of recurrence (Fig. 4b, c).\\nABC frequency is reported to be approximately 1.4% of all primary bone tumors, with 3-30% of the cysts originating in the spinal column). In the spine, ABCs mostly occur in the thoracic or lumbar spines of young patients aged 10-20 years, with approximately 60% affecting the posterior spinal column components). The treatment options for ABC are surgical curettage and bone transplantation), embolization), radiotherapy), and drug injections). Recently, the effective treatment of ABC with embolization alone was reported), but there is a risk of spinal cord infarction due to inadvertent embolization of the Adamkiewicz artery. Therefore, surgery has been selected in most cases to treat ABC that arise in the spine, but there are reports of severe intraoperative hemorrhage,). Therefore, recent reports on ABC treatment often include accounts of surgical treatment with preoperative arterial embolization,). Along with the therapeutic effects of embolization, the reduction in intraoperative hemorrhage allows the surgeon to operate safely and precisely. In this case, arterial embolization was suitable because the ABC was localized in the L5 vertebra, where there is a low risk of embolizing the Adamkiewicz artery. Since she had a pathologic fracture of L5, we selected surgery instead of observing the effects of embolization.\",\n",

Patients with Turner syndrome are mainly characterized by a short stature and lack of secondary sexual characteristics). The risk of gonadoblastoma, colon cancers, and central nervous system tumors have been reported to be greater in patients with Turner syndrome than in the normal population, possibly due to the allelic losses of the X chromosome which has been shown to contains genes related to immunity and cancer. Growth hormone therapy, to treat these patients' short stature, may also increase the risk of cancer). Since this patient had received previous growth hormone therapy to increase her growth rate, it is possible that the growth hormone therapy may have lead to the onset of ABC.

After initial resuscitation and advanced trauma life support (ATLS) care, he was intubated and put on ventilator support. He was diagnosed with bilateral hemothorax and his right lower limb X-rays showed fracture lower one-third femur with extensive metadiaphyseal comminution and fracture ipsilateral proximal tibia extending to metaphysis. A locking distal femoral locking plate was present and had bent (Fig. 1). As per records, he had 3*2cm wound on anterior aspect of thigh which was thoroughly washed, debrided, and sutured and damage control surgery was done in the form of knee-spanning fixator (Fig. 2)and the patient was put on intravenous antibiotics. He stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 7 days, after which he was shifted to our center. As a part of repeat evaluation, all his necessary X-rays were retaken(Fig. 3)which revealed resolution happening in bilateral hemothorax. The right lower limb X-rays revealed knee-spanning external fixator with fracture of lower end femur and proximal end tibia with bent implant in situ (Fig. 2). The patient was kept in the ICU till he was fit for subsequent intervention and appropriate treatment in the form of intravenous antibiotics and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was given. During this period, the patient had low-grade fever, but his inflammatory markers were normal and the wound over the thigh was healthy. On the 8thday, he was taken up in the operation theater with intubation on. Before removing external fixator, the wound present on anterior aspect of distal thigh was again debrided and found to be clean; then, the decision to proceed further was made and the external fixator was removed. The distal femur was opened through lateral approach using liberal skin incision(Fig. 4). After splitting the distal part of tensor fasciae latae, the distal locking screws were removed. Since the plate was bent, a bone hook was used to pull out the proximal end of plate laterally. Now, the position of the proximal screws was marked under C-arm control using an artery forceps. Each screw head was cleared causing minimal muscle damage and they were removed in a minimally invasive fashion, thus preserving the biology of zone of comminution and the plate was gently levered out. Following implant removal, we identified that there was another fracture line in coronal plane just posterior to plate application in the articular block which was identified as lateral condyle Hoffa fracture. The articular reconstruction was first done and the Hoffa fracture was fixed using single partially threaded cancellous screw. Manual linear traction was applied to the limb after reconstructing articular block and grossly comminuted fragments were seen to be aligned, so no attempt was made to open the comminuted area. The length of the limb was maintained by giving linear traction and an electrocautery was used to ensure that the center of femoral head, patella, and second toe lie in same line and checked under C-arm to maintain the correct rotation of the limb. The longest available distal femur locking plate (A.O SYNTHES) in the set was slid in a MIPPO fashion bypassing the zone of comminution after reconstructing the articular block. Same incision was extended below knee to expose proximal tibia and the longest available lateral tibia locking plate(A.O SYNTHES) was slid in a MIPPO manner bypassing the comminution. Now, after fixing both the fractures, the knee was examined for ligamentous instability and it was found to be globally unstable in both the planes. Considering the gross comminution in both femur and the tibia, and the being an open fracture, it was decided to wait for ligamentous reconstruction till bony union was achieved. Wound was sutured in layers over negative drain and a long knee brace was given to the patient since the knee was unstable in both the planes. The patient was shifted out of theater in an intubated state. Immediate post-operative X-rays revealed satisfactory alignment of both fractures, (Fig. 5). During the next 7 days, the patient remained intubated and during this period, the passive movement of joints was given, the limb was elevated and the stitch line was carefully monitored. Once the patient was extubated on the 8th day, it was found that there was an associated foot drop which was missed preoperatively since the patient was in an intubated state. The foot drop splint was applied accordingly and physiotherapy in the form of guarded ROM and muscle strengthening exercises was started. We could not ambulate the patient as he had another fracture in the wrist in the recent past, (Fig. 6). The wound healing was bit delayed but it was ultimately uneventful. An X-ray was taken at 6 weeks post-operative which revealed satisfactory alignment(Fig. 7) and toe touch weight-bearing with long knee brace was started under supervision of trained physiotherapists. The patient was further followed up at 1 month interval and during this rehabilitation period, special attention was given to his psychiatric care. At the latest follow-up of 6 months, the patient had radiological and clinical evidence of union (Fig. 8). At the last available follow-up, the ligamentous instability still persisted, and with long knee brace, he was able to stand and walk. The foot drop was also recovering and there was no extension lag and knee flexion was upto 90  (Fig. 9). At this moment, he was properly counseled and explained in detail about all the available options in the form of arthrodesis, hinged knee arthroplasty, and ligamentous reconstruction, but the patient opted for non-operative management in the form of long knee brace for the time being.',\n",

However, 2 years before the onset of the current episode, a decompensation while on a single antipsychotic agent had motivated the initiation of a mood stabilizer (Valproate semisodium, 2,000 mg/d, with serum valproate concentration of 62 mg/L, within the therapeutic range of 41-100 mg/L) combined with antipsychotic treatment with paliperidone ER (100 mg/28 d).

Six months prior to the onset of the current episode, dual therapy with valproate semisodium (2,000 mg/d) + paliperidone ER (100 mg/28 d) was re-initiated, with a well-tolerated dosage increase (to 2,500 mg/d and 150 mg/28 d, respectively, accompanied by an elevation in serum valproate levels from 67 mg/L before to 97 mg/L after drug dosage increase) without any further adjustment in the 4 months preceding this episode.',\n",

When clinical deterioration (acute manic psychosis with grandiose delusions and psychomotor agitation) again occurred under effective treatment [i.e., despite a serum valproate level within the therapeutic range (91 mg/l)], a change in mood stabilizer was proposed in an overlap-and-taper strategy, after pre-therapeutic assessment (with no outstanding features).

As the patient's symptoms worsened, a right inguinal hernia was suspected and diagnosed by the family doctor but was not treated further. 2 days later, there was skin itching in the right inguinal area, accompanied by redness, swelling and discomfort of the right scrotum, and he went to the local hospital again. Ultrasound examination showed that a contusion of the right testis may have been complicated with orchitis (no specific medical data). Rest was recommended. The pain was not relieved by oral levofloxacin but resolved on its own 3 days later; nevertheless, it became aggravated and unbearable after exercise. At the same time, the scrotal swelling had significantly increased. He came to the emergency room of our hospital, where a plain CT scan showed scrotal enlargement of unknown cause. Upon admission, the right scrotum was obviously enlarged and tender. It had a high surface temperature, normal skin color, negative scrotal elevation test, negative light transmission test, normal sex hormones and normal tumor markers (including Alpha-fetoprotein, chorionic gonadotropin, carbohydrate antigen-199, carbohydrate antigen-125, serum ferritin, and carcinoembryonic antigen). After admission, the patient was treated with levofloxacin, but the pain was still not relieved. On the second day after admission, ultrasound showed heterogenous echo of the right testis. Considering the possibility of inflammatory lesions, neither testicular tuberculosis nor a tumor could be ruled out. A plain + enhanced abdominal CT scan suggested that inflammatory lesions of the testis with necrosis were possible. In addition, there were some secondary changes in the spermatic vessels, and the spermatic vessels could be seen more clearly (Figure 3). After communicating with the patient and his family, he gave informed consent for exploration of the right scrotum, which was performed under general anesthesia.\\nWe made a right groin incision and cut the skin subcutaneously and each layer of muscle in turn, exposing the spermatic cord.

We rotated the testis approximately 90 degrees, lifted the testis out of the scrotum, opened the testicular sheath, and observed a small amount of bloody fluid within. We opened the tunica albuginea, where we observed a large amount of bloody fluid and a fish-like tissue bulge. The whole testicular boundary was unclear, the epididymis was enlarged, and the tunica albuginea had a visible tear of approximately 1.5 cm in length (Figure 4).

The pathological diagnosis was rhabdomyosarco-ma of the right testis. The postoperative chromosome karyotype analysis showed that there was no Y chromosome microdeletion. Positron emission tomography (PET) examination showed no systemic metabolic abnormalities and no systemic metastasis. These findings suggested that the patient should be treated with a VAC regimen (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide).

       "    'case_text': 'A 31-year-old man with a past medical history of intravenous drug use (IVDU), specifically heroin and cocaine, and untreated hepatitis C virus infection presented to the emergency department for the evaluation of chest pain. The patient\\'s chest pain began approximately 5 days prior to presentation as a sharp, non-radiating, persistent pain, which was worse with inspiration and on movement. The pain progressed to 10/10 in intensity below the nipples bilaterally. Our patient endorsed exertional dyspnea mostly because of the inability to inspire without significant pain and subjective fever. He also reported worsening cough productive of light green sputum and, at times, a scant amount of blood. Moreover, approximately a week prior, the patient missed a vein while injecting the drug in the right side of his neck which led to swelling and redness of the area. The remainder of the review of systems was noncontributory. As for his past medical history, our patient reported being informed he was positive for hepatitis C 10 years prior, but he did not seek treatment nor did he follow up with medical providers for the same. The patient has a smoking history of 15 pack years and has been injecting \"speedball\", a mixture of cocaine and heroin, almost daily for the last 10 years. Our patient reported using \"a bundle and a half\" of heroin together with \"few grams\" of cocaine in powder form with water daily. When the patient was not able to acquire cocaine, he used crack which comes in solid \"rock\" form. He reported crushing the rock form and diluting it with vinegar. He heated the mixture after filtering through cotton-wool before injecting himself using a syringe. The patient generally uses his neck and left arm veins to inject drugs. Our patient used the same syringe for up to a month. He reported that, at times, the needle tip would break off in tiny fragments and it would become difficult to acquire access through it. The patient\\'s last use of these drugs was the day of admission. Our patient admitted to being homeless and has been living on the streets for the last 3 years.\\nInitial vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 98.7  F, pulse of 135/min, respiratory rate of 19/min and blood pressure of 108/72 mmHg. He appeared to be in mild distress, with poor inspiratory effort due to pain. Physical examination was significant for poor dentition including a few chipped and missing teeth but no oral lesions or thrush. There was an area of erythema, induration and tenderness on the right side of the neck, about 4 x 10cm in size. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Examination of the extremities revealed track marks on left antecubital fossa and onychomycosis of the nail beds. Stigmata of bacterial endocarditis were not seen.\\nInitial laboratory data was significant for a normal white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.5 K/muL, hemoglobin of 10.2 gm/dL and platelet count of 106 K/muL. The patient\\'s mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 73.6 fL, with red cell distribution width of 15.3%. Serum sodium was 129 mEq/L, with otherwise unremarkable basic metabolic panel. Serum lactic acid was 1.2 mmol/L (normal 0.5-2.2 mmol/L) and D-dimer was 1197 ng/mL (normal 0-230 ng/mL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 95 mm/hr (normal 0-15 mm/hr) and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 15.2 ng/dL (normal <1.0 ng/dL). Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine and opiates but negative for amphetamines. Chest X-ray indicated a patchy increased density in the left lower lobe, lingula, and right middle and lower lobes (Fig. 1). Given a significantly elevated d-dimer in the setting of tachycardia, CT angiography of the chest was performed which excluded pulmonary embolism. However, multiple, fluffy, nodules of varying size and ill-defined margins were seen throughout both lungs (Fig. 2). Some of these nodules were cavitary. Larger coalescent areas were seen in the left lower lobe and the lingula. These findings were concerning for septic emboli or metastatic disease. As a result, CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed which did not show any masses. The only finding was splenomegaly, measuring 18cm in length. Furthermore, given the findings of tenderness on the right side of the neck, CT of the neck with contrast performed to exclude septic jugular vein phlebitis or Lemierre\\'s syndrome was unremarkable.\\nMeanwhile, blood cultures were drawn and our patient was empirically administered intravenous (IV) Vancomycin 1 g and Piperacillin-Tazobactam 3.375 g. Emergent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed which did not show valvular vegetation or abscess. Given a high suspicion of bacterial endocarditis (BE), trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed which also did not show any vegetations or abscess. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to IV Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours. IV Vancomycin was continued to achieve a therapeutic vancomycin trough level. Pulmonology was consulted and, based on the findings on high resolution CT scan of the chest (Fig. 3), the decision was made to perform navigational bronchoscopy to obtain endobronchial and transbronchial lung biopsies. Specimens were obtained from the right lower lobe using a needle biopsy, and near the pleura using the forceps. A few specimens were also obtained using triple needle brush. In addition, specimens from bronchial washings were sent for cytologic analysis, routine cultures, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture and fungal culture.\\nAdditional diagnostic evaluation included HIV testing, QuantiFeron TB, hepatitis panel, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (DsDNA) antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and complement levels. Results were unremarkable.\\nHistopathology report of right lower lobe biopsy specimen was normal with no mononuclear infiltration. A brush tip specimen was also obtained from right lower lobe. Moreover, approximately 55 cc of thick pale orange fluid was obtained via bronchial wash of right lower lobe which showed scattered refractile material surrounded by dense neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltration (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative.\\nThe patient\\'s maximum temperature was 100.1  F five days after the admission on antibiotics. The patient\\'s heart rate normalized to 70-90/min and WBC count remained in between 6 and 8 K/muL throughout admission. The patient\\'s chest pain improved over the course of days but mild discomfort with breathing persisted. Blood, respiratory and bronchial wash cultures for bacteria, AFB and fungi remained negative. Because of ongoing concern for bacterial septic emboli, the patient was continued on IV Vancomycin and IV Cefepime for a total of 6 weeks. The patient completed the final 3 weeks of antibiotics at a sub-acute facility.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 20-year old male patient with genetically confirmed DMD with known associated dilated cardiomyopathy was transferred to our supraregional stroke unit due to a wake-up stroke with severe right-sided sensomotoric hemiparesis and aphasia as he was right-hand dominant. Due to status post detection of a thrombus in the left ventricle in August 2015, the patient was on an anticoagulation regime with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), which was interrupted in error because of a misapprehension the day before. In addition to LMWH, the patient was treated with bisoprolol, magnesium and vitamin D. A moderate- to high-grade hypotonic tetraparesis due to the DMD-related muscle weakness was already known. The acute presentation of the patient was due to a substantial worsening of the preexisting weakness on the right side, including a new facial weakness and aphasia, resulting in a formal NIHSS score of 20 points. The time at which the new symptoms were recognized was 08:15; last-seen-normal (LSN) was about 03:00. Initially the patient was brought by paramedics to the pediatric hospital at which he is best known. An immediate transfer to our department was performed, and the patient arrived at 08:56 in our emergency room.\\nVital parameters were stable, the international normalized ratio was 0.9 measured by CoaguChek  (Roche Diagnostics) in the emergency room. Cerebral CT scan revealed only slight early ischemic changes in the LMCA territory (ASPECT-Score = 8 points) but with hyperdense media sign on the left (Figure 1(a)). Subsequent CT angiography confirmed a proximal occlusion of the LMCA (Figure 1(b)).\\nPatient education took place, including the patient's mother as his legally authorized representative, so MT started quickly at 09:23 (door-to-groin time = 27 min). Considering the specific risks of general anesthesia in DMD, the procedure was performed with propofol, remifentanil and rocuronium. At 24 min after groin puncture, the recanalization was successfully completed (TICI grade 3) by direct thrombus aspiration using the Penumbra System  (Penumbra Inc. Alameda, CA, USA). Since the patient formally exceeded even the extended time window of 6 h after LSN, no additional IV thrombolysis was performed.\\nShortly after successful recanalization (Figure 1(c-d)) and directly after recovering from anesthesia, the half-sided motoric worsening of the preexisting hypotonic tetraparesis improved, but the aphasia persisted to a reduced extent (NIHSS score of 14 points). With logopedic speech therapy, the aphasia resolved almost completely in the further course of his hospitalization. The daily NIHSS score showed an improvement up to 12 points within 9 days.\\nTransthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed no evidence of an intracardial thrombus, but a relevant reduced ejection fraction. No atrial fibrillation was detectable via prolonged ECG monitoring. Laboratory investigations found high creatine kinase at 1883 U/L (38-174), high lactate dehydrogenase at 321 U/L (135-225) and a high creatine kinase-muscle/brain at 144.5 U/L (<24). Due to the low muscle mass, creatinine serum level was extremely low at 0.25 mg/dl (0.70-0.12), so it could not serve as a reliable kidney retention parameter in this case. Consequently, we determined the kidney function via cystatin C, where a concentration of 1.10 mg/L (0.61-0.95) with a resulting glomerular filtration rate of 83 ml/min (>=90 ml/min) was shown. Further hemostaseological investigations revealed no thrombophilia.\\nFollow-up CT scans revealed a demarcation of the ischemia in the left area of the basal ganglia with a mild edema (Figure 1(e-f)). After discussing the specific considerations of indicated anticoagulation with the patient and his mother, oral anticoagulation with dabigatran (150 mg bid) was initiated for secondary prophylaxis.\\nAt discharge from our stroke unit and transfer to a rehabilitation center after 9 days of hospitalization, the patient showed a complete recovery from the ischemia-induced central hemiparesis. Only a slight aphasic component was present, resulting to an NIHSS score of 12 points at discharge, which was mainly due to his preexisting DMD symptoms.\",\n",

He smoked for 40 years and had a smoking index of 20 pack-years. He was admitted to the hospital for a physical examination, during which a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left hilar occupancy measuring approximately 5.9x3.6 cm, obstructive atelectasis in the left lung field, and a small pleural effusion. Further fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed that the left main bronchus was blocked by new organisms, the surfaces of which oozed blood. This location was the site of the biopsy, which revealed lung squamous cell carcinoma ( Figure 1A ). P40 (+), CK56 (-), ki-67 > 25%, TTF-1 (-) ( Figures 1B-F ) in immunohistochemistry. The patient ceased chemotherapy because he could not endure the adverse effects of nausea and vomiting after one cycle of perfusion chemotherapy (40 mg nedaplatin via bronchial artery infusion administration) and paclitaxel systemic intravenous treatment. After 7 months, the patient developed hemoptysis with a daily volume of about 10-20 mL, and chest CT scan revealed a left deviation of the mediastinum, left lung consolidation and atelectasis, a soft tissue mass in the left hilum with a size of about 8.1x4.6 cm, left main bronchial obstruction, and enlarged lymph nodes in the left cervical root and mediastinum. No obvious metastatic lesions had been found after head MRI, whole-body bone imaging, whole-abdomen enhancement CT. We took the disease's progression into consideration (Clinical Stage, cT4N3M1a, stage IVA). Subsequently, the BRCA2 EXON15 G25085 mutation was detected by blood next-generation sequencing, and the tumor mutation load TMB was 5.98 mutations/Mb. Based on the sequencing test results, we immediately started aggressive treatment and decided to use the PARP inhibitor Olaparib (300mg twice a day) with the PD-1 inhibitor Cindilimab. After one week, the patient's hemoptysis stopped. A repeat chest CT revealed that the left hilar mass was substantially smaller than before, with a long diameter of around 4.5 cm, and that the left lung was recruiting and the pleural effusion was absorbed after receiving Olaparib for two months and PD-1 inhibitor for two immunotherapy sessions. At this time, the patient appeared new symptoms, puffy eyelids, decreased urine volume, and generalized weakness. In further testing of common serological indicators, we found that blood creatinine increased from normal value at the beginning of the disease to 163.90mumol/L. Meanwhile, urine precipitation microscopy showed urine protein (+) without a tubular pattern. Routine blood, liver function, inflammation indicators, tumor indicators were normal, and autoantibodies were negative. Following the multidisciplinary team's discussion, we took into account the kidney damage caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors, which was graded as 2, and stopped using the PD-1 inhibitor in accordance with the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) 2022 recommendation. One month after quitting the PD-1 inhibitor, the serum creatinine level was back to normal. Six months after starting Olaparib monotherapy, the patient was more advanced.

She was diagnosed as a malignant tumor of the gastric body by electronic gastroscopy and biopsy pathology. The abdominal enhanced CT shows multiple lymph nodes enlargement in the abdominal and retroperitoneum in the outpatient clinic of our hospital ( Figures 1A, B  ). The patient received six cycles of chemotherapy in another hospital (SOX regimen for 1 cycle; S-1 and oxaliplatin. Paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, S-1, and Sintilimab for 5 cycles). After the end of chemotherapy, the effect of chmotherapy was evaluated as partial remission (PR). The patient asked for surgical treatment in our hospital. Physical examination showed that the abdomen was flat, the abdominal muscles were soft, the upper abdomen was mild deep tenderness, there was no rebound pain, and there was no obvious abdominal mass. Laboratory results showed that hemoglobin content decreased: 97g/L (normal range 110-150g/L). CA72-4:4.90U/mL (normal range 0-6.9U/mL), AFP: 1.30ng/mL (normal range 0-8.1ng/mL), CEA:1.13ng/mL (normal range 0-10ng/mL), CA199:17.71U/mL (normal range 0-37U/mL), CA125:2.85U/mL (normal range 0-30.2U/mL). There was no significant increase in serum tumor markers. After the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we performed a PET-CT examination for the patient. 18F-FDG PET-CT showed that the mass showed changes after chemotherapy, slight thickening of the lesser curvature of the stomach, the mass did not significantly absorb FDG, and it was found that the left axillary lymph node was enlarged, and the mass uptake of FDG increased slightly, but it was considered as an inflammatory lesion ( Figures 1C ). After multidisciplinary tumor consultation, we decided to perform the radical total gastrectomy on the patient, and regular examination of the enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla. After obtaining the consent of the patient and her family, the patient underwent radical total gastrectomy (Roux-en-Y digestive tract reconstruction) in August 2021. Postoperative pathology showed that the area of ulcerative gastric cancer was about 4 x 3cm. The main tumor cells were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, local invasion of the deep muscular layer of the gastric wall, and tumor cells can be seen in the lymphatic vessels but no definite nerve invasion. Lauren's classification was the diffuse type ( Figure 2A ). Only one of the 21 lymph nodes had metastasis, which was located on the lesser curvature of the gastric wall, and no obvious tumor metastasis was found in the rest of the lymph nodes (ypT2N1M0 IIA). Immunohistochemical staining showed that tumor cells expressed CK8/18, individual cells expressed Syn, and did not express CgA, CD56, SALL4, Oct3/4, C-erb-B-2, and Ki-67 proliferative index was approximately 90%. The patient recovered smoothly without obvious postoperative complications and was discharged 13 days after radical total gastrectomy.\\nOne month after radical total gastrectomy, the patient found that the left axillary mass grew faster than before and was accompanied by the limitation of left upper limb movement. Physical examination showed that the left axillary mass was about 4 x 2cm in size, hard, had an unclear boundary, and had a poor range of motion. Ultrasound examination of the bilateral breast and axilla showed that there was no obvious mass in the bilateral breast, and several hypoechoic lesions were found in the left axilla, the size of which was about 4.3 x 1.9cm, the boundary was clear, the cortex was thickened, the medulla was eccentric and the blood flow signal was abundant ( Figure 3A ). No obvious abnormality was found in mammary gland molybdenum target X-ray ( Figures 3B, C  ), mediastinal and supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes were not found in CT, and no obvious bone metastasis in whole-body bone scintigraphy ( Figure 3D ). The patient underwent the axillary lymph node biopsy in October 2021. During the operation, the enlarged lymph nodes were located next to the axillary vein, fused into clumps, hard texture, and closely combined with the surrounding tissues. Intraoperative frozen sections showed that there were 5 lymph nodes in the left axilla, and all of them had cancer metastasis. After that, we performed radical axillary lymph node dissection and 14 of the 18 lymph nodes had metastases. Pathology showed that the tumor cells were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. immunohistochemical staining showed that most of the tumor cells expressed Caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), CK20, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3), and a small amount of sequence-binding protein (SATB) 2 and Mucin-5AC (MUC5AC), but no expression of CK7 and TTF-1 was found ( Figures 2B-E ). After communicating with pathologists, considering the immunohistochemical results and the history of gastric cancer, we considered that the left axillary lymph node tumor was metastasized by gastric cancer.\\nThe patient received docetaxel and fluorouracil chemotherapy after radical axillary lymph node dissection, and a progressive increase in CEA, CA19-9, and CA72-4 was found (  Figure 4  ). Three months after the second operation, the MR examination of cervical and thoracic vertebrae due to back pain revealed secondary malignant tumors of the spine, but the patient refused to undergo whole-body bone imaging. CT of the chest and abdomen showed double clavicular and mediastinal enlarged lymph nodes, considering the malignant tumor. But the patient refused any treatment and died 11 months after the second operation.\",\n",

She had a soft, smooth, non-tender hepatomegaly, 4cm below the right costal margin and no other abdominal organ was palpably enlarged.\\nDiagnosis: electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 112 bpm, QRS axis of +300, predominant left ventricular forces and an incomplete right bundle branch block. Echocardiography showed a 7mm perimembranous ventricular septal defect partially restricted by the tricuspid valve septal leaflet aneurysm, shunting left to right (Figure 1). The peak interventricular pressure gradient was 80mmHg and the left atrium, left ventricle and pulmonary arteries were dilated with good biventricular function.\\nTherapeutic interventions: the child underwent successful transcatheter VSD device closure with a 0608 Lifetech CeraTM duct occluder (Lifetech Scientific Corporation, Shenzhen, China) under general anaesthesia using a laryngeal mask airway. Both arterial and venous femoral accesses were obtained, and 100 units/kg of intravenous heparin was administered. The intravenous antibiotic was administered as per the institution\\'s protocol. Pre-procedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a PmVSD measuring 7.0mm and was restricted to 4.0mm by the tricuspid septal leaflet aneurysm. A left ventriculogram done in left anterior oblique (LAO) 400 cranial 200 view using a 5Fr pigtail catheter confirmed the echocardiography findings (Figure 2). The VSD was crossed retrograde from the aorta with a 5F Judkins Right catheter and 0.035\" 260cm Terumo wire combination and the wire manoeuvred into the superior vena cava and then the innominate vein. It was then snared using a 4F 10mm LifetechTM snare catheter (Lifetech Scientific Corporation, Shenzhen, China) and exteriorised from the right femoral vein forming an arteriovenous (AV) loop. The femoral venous short sheath was exchanged for a 6F Steer Ease introducer sheath (Lifetech Scientific Corporation, Shenzhen, China) which was passed antegrade over the venous limb of the AV loop and the sheath tip placed in the left ventricle. The duct occluder device was prepared, loaded in the delivery sheath, and deployed across the PmVSD under fluoroscopic and TTE guidance and released (Figure 3). The procedure time was 77 minutes and the fluoroscopy time was 24.3 minutes.\\nFollow-up and outcome of interventions: there were no procedural complications. Post-deployment TTE showed the device in a stable position with no residual shunt and no aortic valve regurgitation (Figure 4). Post-procedure electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm. The child was discharged 24 hours after the procedure in good health. Oral Aspirin 5mg/kg was prescribed for 6 months. By the third month following the procedure, activity had significantly improved, and she had gained 1.0 kg. She has been seen severally on follow-up; the last being two years post-intervention and has no complications.\\nPatient perspective: \"we are happy that our child can now live a normal life after this procedure\". The parents expressed profound gratitude to the entire health team and were grateful to have had the benefit of state-of-the-art cardiovascular care in the country.\\nInformed consent: written and informed signed consent to publish de-identified data of the child was obtained from both parents.',\n",

The caecum was found to be gangrenous and had sloughed off (Figure 2) and there were multiple perforations in the ascending colon and transverse colon. Initially, right hemicolectomy was done but the resected end of the transverse colon showed multiple sloughed off ulcers in the mucosa with transmural involvement. The proximal sigmoid colon was also found to be perforated into the retroperitoneum. There was no evidence of thrombosis of mesenteric vessels. In view of intraoperative findings, the procedure was converted into subtotal colectomy with proximal ileostomy and exteriorization of the distal end of the sigmoid colon.\\nGross examination of the resected colectomy specimen showed sloughed off caecum with multiple perforations in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon (Figure 3). On cut section examination, there were patchy segments of extensive transmural necrosis with multiple defects ranging from 0.5-2 cm throughout the large bowel (Figure 4). Histopathological examination of the specimen showed findings of multiple mucosal ulcerations with liquefactive necrosis with normal intervening mucosa, associated with full-thickness perforations and extensive diffuse transmural inflammation. The ulcers were typically flask-shaped, with a narrow neck and broad, undermined base. In the colon, there was no evidence of architectural distortion or any evidence of crypt destructive colitis or granulomas to support the presence of Crohn's disease. The colonic mucosal ulcers were covered with neutrophilic debris within which E. histolytica were identified (Figure 5). Pathogenic Entamoebae trophozoites were recognized by the presence of phagocytosed ingested intracellular red cells. Periodic acid-Schiff staining was positive (Figure 6).

An intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in the pancreatic head was also found during the preoperative assessment for cholecystectomy. Because hyperglycemia (565 mg/dl) was detected, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and insulin was immediately administered. As the patient's hyperglycemia improved, his general fatigue, pollakiuria, and thirst disappeared. At first, he did not complain of any abdominal symptoms, and a physical examination showed unremarkable results, but back pain thereafter slowly appeared. A urinalysis revealed glycosuria but not proteinuria. A blood test showed a marked elevation of the patient's hemoglobin A1c level (11.8%, range 4.6-6.2%) and slightly decreased levels of hemoglobin (12.6 g/dl, range 13.6-18.3 g/dl) and amylase (36 U/l, range 39-134 U/l), but normal liver and renal function. However, his cancer antigen 19-9 (381.6 U/ml, range 0.0-37.0 U/ml) and carcinoembryonic antigen (6.6 ng/ml, range 0.0-5.0 ng/ml) levels were elevated. Because pancreatic cancer was suspected based on the rapid progression of diabetes mellitus and high level of cancer antigen 19-9, a radiological examination was also performed. Computed tomography revealed a 4.6-cm solid mass in the pancreatic tail with ring enhancement and a 4.2-cm multilocular cystic mass in the pancreatic head (fig. 1). In addition, three liver metastatic masses and three abdominal lymph node metastases with ring enhancement, which were similar to the tumor in the pancreatic tail, were detected. Therefore, we suspected unresectable pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastases that was concomitant with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas. To get a second opinion, the patient was discharged and visited another hospital. He eventually came back to our hospital 1 month after the first administration. The patient's back pain worsened and his cancer antigen 19-9 level increased (507.8 U/ml, range 0.0-37.0 U/ml) in comparison to his first presentation. We re-evaluated his disease using computed tomography, which revealed progression of the primary pancreatic cancer and increased numbers of liver and abdominal lymph node metastases. Notably, two solid masses were detected in the gastric wall of the upper body and the antrum. Both of them were separated from the primary pancreatic cancer and seemed to be located in the submucosal layer (fig. 2). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor with normal mucosa in the posterior wall of the upper body of the stomach, suggesting the gastric hematogenous metastasis of pancreatic cancer (fig. 3). Pathological examinations, such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration or percutaneous liver biopsy, had not been performed because the patient declined additional examinations and due to the seemingly rapid progression of the disease.

However, she had no other medical history, including psychiatric disorders. There was no family history of psychiatric disorders or neurodegenerative disorders. Following graduation from high school, she began working in a nightclub. She got married in her twenties and had a daughter. She divorced a few years later. Following her daughter gaining employment, she started living alone. She was on public income support during her visit to our clinic. She gradually felt a lack of motivation for outdoor activities at the age of 82 years. Simultaneously, she started facing difficulty with housework and complained of mild amnesia. A few months later, she informed her daughter about the delusional thought that the family doctor drew her blood to kill her. Despite the delusion of persecution, she continued visiting the clinic. Her daughter pointed out that her thought was delusional as it was impossible. Despite all evidence to the contrary, it remained unchanged. However, the delusion suddenly changed a month later, without any specific cause. She believed that her family doctor had fallen in love with her and proposed marriage to her. The delusional conviction seemingly strengthened with time. Moreover, she gradually made up her mind to accept the proposal. Considering the gradual progression of cognitive impairment and apathy, her daughter proposed living together. She refused her daughter's proposal and continued living alone because she was convinced that she would live with her family doctor in the near future. Her daughter recommended that she visit a memory clinic. Although she did not have any insight into her delusional beliefs, she was aware of her cognitive impairment. Therefore, she visited our memory clinic and was admitted to our hospital for examination and treatment at the age of 83 years.\\nOn her first visit to our hospital, we did not observe any apparent depressive or manic symptoms. Neurological examinations revealed mild bradykinesia, mild rigidity of the left upper and lower limbs, and chronic constipation. The results of her cognitive assessment were as follows: Mini-Mental State Examination score was 20/30, a Japanese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score was 10/70, the index of subtests of the digit span of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III was 5, and Mayo Fluctuation Questionnaire score was 5 out of 8, which indicated mild recent memory impairment, attention deficit, and cognitive fluctuation (Table 1). We conducted the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 12 to assess her neuropsychiatric symptoms. She scored 20 points, involving the categories of delusion (12/12) and apathy (8/12) (Table 1). Blood test results, including vitamins, thyroid function, and infections, were all normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed mild diffuse cortical atrophy and mild bilateral hippocampal atrophy, compatible with her age (Figure 1). Perfusion single photon emission computed tomography revealed mild hypoperfusion in the bilateral parietal lobe. Myocardial accumulation of metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) was low (H/M = early: 1.72, delayed: 1.34) (Figure 2). The aforementioned results indicated a probable diagnosis of DLB.\\nFollowing the examinations, she was prescribed 3 mg of donepezil, the dose of which was gradually increased to 10 mg. She was simultaneously prescribed 25 mg of quetiapine (at night) for the treatment of delusions. However, we soon discontinued quetiapine because of its adverse reactions, such as drowsiness and dizziness. We also prescribed brexpiprazole (1 mg/day) and risperidone (0.5 mg/day). However, their side effects, such as drowsiness, were extremely severe, without any amelioration of her delusion. While she did not refuse the medications, she still had no insight to her delusion. Moreover, she occasionally claimed to visit her family doctor following her discharge. We then prescribed blonanserin (4 mg/day) and continued it, with extremely mild side effects. After 2 weeks, her attitude to the delusional beliefs began to change. She gradually lost passion for her family doctor. Based on our suggestions, she changed her family doctor and was discharged from our hospital. During follow-up, she rarely talked about the previous doctor, who had been the subject of her delusion. She still lives alone, and her delusion has not recurred. She is currently on donepezil (10 mg/day) and a small amount of an antipsychotic agent, with coordination of the circumstances (non-pharmacotherapy).\",\n",

Results of blood sampling showed that serum glycosylated antibody 125 was increased with a value of 62.98 u/mL, as well as the fasting blood glucose was slightly increased again with a value of 6.51mmol/l. As such, we supplemented the immunohistochemistry test, and the result indicated that the expression of SSTR2 was positive. Abdominal enhanced CT and upper abdomen MRI showed multiple liver nodules (May 2019). Thus, the first cycle of chemotherapy was given on May 11, 2019 (capecitabine: 1000mg BID day 1-14 + temozolomide 200mg QD day 10-14, 4 weeks as a cycle; octreotide 40mg QD day 1, 4 weeks as a cycle). On the 27th day of treatment, the skin lesions on the face of the patient were disappeared, and pigmentation remained on the skin of the legs. Up to now, this patient has received this therapeutic regimen for 5 cycles. On October 10, 2019, the patient underwent transarterial embolization with local anesthesia. Follow up to October 31, 2019, no tumor progression was observed for this patient. Finally, the written informed consent has been provided by this patient, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of West China Hospital.',\n",

His vital sign was stable (pulse rate 80 beat/min, respiratory rate 20 times/min, blood pressure 140/70 mmHg) and no signs of visible injury were found. But a CT scan revealed a widening mediastinum and a massive left pleural effusion. He had undertaken medical treatment and monitoring.\\nOn the seventh day of admission, he complained a severe chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed a ventricular fibrillation. A defibrillation was successful, but the ST segment remained elevated on the lead V1-V5, with cardiac enzyme: CK3 974 U/L and CK-MB 469 U/L. Echocardiography showed no contraction of the anterior cardiac wall and ejection fraction (EF) 36%, indicating a myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed a disruption of the proximal left anterior descending artery with a 95% stenosis. A PTA was unsuccessful.\\nTwenty days later, the patient was transferred to our department, and MRI revealed a spindle-shaped aneurysm at the aortic isthmus with an irregular inner contour. A rupture of interior wall was suspected (Figure 1(a)). On May 19, 2001, from right femoral approach, a 32 mm x 120 mm individualized indigenous endograft (stainless steel stent with silk membrane) was made and successfully deployed under fluoroscopic observation. Angiography showed a successful treatment (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). The patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition seven days later, with EF improved to 47.9%. Follow-up MRI was obtained two years later (Figure 1(d)).\\nIn October 2010, the patient came back for checkup, informing that he had resumed working shortly after discharge, not as a driver, but as a security guard. He enjoyed such a good health that it took him only six minutes to run 1000 meters. Even though his echocardiography still showed no movement of the anterior cardiac wall, he was in good shape. A computed tomographic angiography (CTA) followup confirmed that the endograft was in the same position vis-a-vis the isthmus. Although the middle portion of the graft was slightly dilated, it was acceptable at this point (Figure 2). In July 2012, eleven years after endograft deployment, he remained healthy, with all functions normal.',\n",

This mass had a well-distributed calcified wall wrapping around the homogeneous content with point calcifications. The content showed mild enhancements during arterial phases (Figure 1B). The primary diagnosis was abdominal AE disease. This patient underwent laparotomy surgery for a mass resection. During surgery, we found a large calcified mass located near the upper right kidney arising from the right adrenal gland adjacent to the lower right hepatic lobes.

This patient recovered smoothly and was discharged uneventfully 20 days after the operation.\\nThe resected specimen had a calculated shell (Figure 1C), which wrapped around the homogeneous necrotic content with point calcifications (Figure 1D). The pathological examination revealed calcification of the surface, necrosis and sclerotization of the contents. The immunohistochemical examination revealed positive expressions of CD-34, CD-31 and D2-40 but no expression of CK. These findings supported a pathologic diagnosis of adrenal lymphangioma with hemorrhage and hematoma formation.

Three days later, the patient visited our hospital and was admitted because of a Jefferson fracture and basilar impression revealed during the XP, CT, and MRI of the craniocervical junction (Fig. 1). After hospitalization, lower cranial nerve palsies involving the ninth, tenth, and twelfth cranial nerves were observed. The gap in the fractured anterior arch of the atlas was over 5 mm, and CT sagittal images showed a basilar impression. The tip of the odontoid process was located above the Chamberlain\\'s line (a line from the hard palate to the base of the skull). Furthermore, strong radiating pain occurred when swallowing from the pharynx to the larynx. The pain and the dysphagia made food intake extremely difficult. As bone fusion was expected to be unlikely by external fixation with a halo vest, a posterior fixation surgery was performed.\\nOn the eleventh day after the accident, occipitocervical posterior fixation was performed (day X). The O-C2 angle was kept approximately 5 degrees wider than the preoperative O-C2 angle to prevent postoperative dysphagia and dyspnea, and the basilar impression was slightly reduced. The surgery was uneventfully; however, pharyngeal palsy and airway obstruction occurred. Consequently, tracheostomy was performed using a single-lumen cuffed tracheostomy tube.\\nOn the X+2 day, bradyesthesia and bradykinesia of his epipharynx and hypopharynx were found with a nasopharyngeal fiberscope, and tube feeding with a nasogastric tube was initiated.\\nOn the X+8 day, SLP therapy was started for tracheostomy decannulation.

In our patient, pharyngeal and swallowing reflexes were absent. He had dysphagia, velopharyngeal incompetence, vocal fold palsy, and hypoglossal nerve palsy. The strength of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles was difficult to assess because of pain. The patient did not show any facial sensory disturbance. The patient\\'s MASA score was 94/200, indicating severe dysphagia.\\nOn the X+8 day, training was initiated to induce vocalization by injecting air from the side tube (the side tube is used for vocal practice and suction of deposits on the cuff) using a 50-cc syringe. On the X+10 day, the patient could utter vocal sounds using the training tube.

Moreover, on the X+12 day, the swallowing reflex improved and the MASA score increased to 115/200. The tracheostomy tube was changed to a double-lumen, fenestrated cuffed tube, and the decannulation advanced to the step of tube occlusion with a one-way valve. On the X+14 day, the patient was able to extend his tongue to the upper lip, and pharyngeal reflex appeared. The patient was able to breathe using a one-way valve during the day. On the X+17 day, his cough reflex improved and the MASA\\'s score increased to 142/200; moreover, the patient could clear all the \"Multidisciplinary decision chart for evaluating readiness for decannulation used in the Rehabilitation Basel\") criteria with the deflated cuff; hence, tube occlusion training was initiated.

Nine months later, she developed pain in the right thigh which progressively increased in severity over time. She presented with a pathological fracture in the neck of the right femur. 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan showed increased osteoblastic activity in the right humerus, iliac bones, sacrum, shaft of the right femur, and the scan findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic disease. Concurrently, serum electrophoresis revealed monoclonal gammopathy. With the diagnostic possibilities of metastases from unknown primary site and myeloma, 18F-FDG PET/CT scan was done. 18F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed moderate-to-intense abnormal FDG uptake in the bulky uterine cervix with intensely FDG avid osteolytic skeletal lesions [Figure 1]. The possibility of carcinoma cervix was considered; however, extensive skeletal metastases with no lymph nodal involvement being unusual encouraged us to entertain other diagnostic possibilities. Hence, a biopsy from the uterine cervix was done which revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Further, the patient underwent surgical fixation of the pathological fracture of the right femur, and histopathology from this fracture site again came as DLBCL. Thus, she was diagnosed as having extranodal lymphoma (DLBCL) with skeletal and uterine cervix involvement. She was then started on steroids and chemotherapy. Unusual pattern of involvement of uterine cervix and multiple osteolytic skeletal lesions in 18F-FDG PET/CT scan triggered us to search for other differential diagnoses and also helped in guiding the site of biopsy to reach a final diagnosis and initiate the appropriate treatment.',\n",

After being discharged from observation in the neurology ward he was refferred to the ENT department, where the CT scan showed a foreign body that had penetrated through the external acoustic meatus, invaded the middle ear and went down the Eustachian tube. There was an injury in the carotid canal and thrombosis in the internal carotid artery (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 6a, Figure 7, Figure 7a), in its furcation, proven by arteriogram (Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 9a). The patient refused a complete audiologic workup, and we noticed only a profound hearing loss on the right side. Internal medicine doctors examined him and aproved him for general anesthesia for foreign body removal. He was conscious and able to converse, however because of his dementia he did not make sense when he spoke.\\nUnder general anesthesia we noticed a foreign body that appeared to be a wood stick used to make barbecue. With a strong forceps we mobilized it in an attempt to remove it, and because of the carotid thrombosis it would be very unlikely to have profuse bleeding. The foreign body did not move. We did a retro-auricular approach with incision in the meatus skin. Since it filled the whole space, we did a mastoidectomy, through which we noticed incus dislocation towards the mastoid cavity. It was removed, together with the malleus. We did a canal wall down approach and in the mastoid cavity we noticed that the wood stick filled the entire middle ear and seemed to progress towards the Eustachian tube. We tried to remove it again, unsuccesfully. We decided to cut it with the burr and keep on using the burr all the way to the begining of the Eustachian Tube. We did not see the stapes. At this point we noticed that the stick penetrated the tube like a locking wedge used in ship building. With the burr we proceeded in cutting all the bone around but especially the wood stick itself which was cut from inside and then pushed inside the lumen made by the burr. There were no reference points, but we saw the carotid canal erosion. We progressed like this for about six centimeters, always drilling down on the stick itself and removing a little of the adjacent bone. Our attempts to remove it were unsuccesful. After this course we noticed the bone had ended and there was soft tissue ahead (cartilaginous portion of the tube). At this point the tip of the wood stick felt loosen and could be removed. Medially we observed a small central nervous system dehiscence. Under the surgical microscope we observed a larger space that would open inferiorly and that was later confirmed as being the nasopharynx after we used the nasal endoscope to look at it. The broad cavity left behind in the tube was filled with muscle and the surgical wound was similar to that left after a canal wall down mastoidectomy (Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14). We rebuilt the meatus and sutured the retroauricular incision.\\nIn a later CT scan we noticed na erosion of the inferior semicircular canal and of the carotid canal, and part of the central nervous system exposure.',\n",

Midface volumization brought the cheek apex into a more superolateral position, creating a soft and feminine ogee curve, as well as a more oval shape to the face. Brow elevation gave her a slight arch to the lateral one-third of her eyebrow. Her nose became smoother, straighter, and more delicate via tip elevation and camouflage of the dorsal hump. Lastly, the lower face was feminized by lip augmentation, as well as tapering and narrowing of the chin.\",\n",

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, pelvis, and lumbothoracic spine showed multiple hypodense liver lesions and diffuse sclerotic bone lesions within the thoracic and lumbar spine, ribs, sacrum, and ischium suspicious for metastatic malignancy. Fine-needle aspiration of the liver lesions yielded immunochemistry positive for focal CA 19-9 staining suggestive of adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal (GI) origin. Serum CEA and CA 19-9 were within normal limits. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not reveal an upper GI tumor; however, a metal object was seen in the hypopharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter (Figure 1). It appeared to be fixed and could not be moved with grasping forceps. The adult gastroscope could not be advanced beyond the object; however, the ultraslim could. A sagittal CT view of the neck with contrast showed the offset of the anterior cervical internal fusion plate with direct communication to the hypopharyngeal airway and suggesting erosion through the posterior hypopharyngeal soft tissue (Figure 2). Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and presumably metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, neurosurgery service recommended medical management rather than surgical management. A 6-week course of intravenous ertapenem was initiated due to the high risk of abscess formation. The patient underwent gastric tube placement for feeding and was eventually discharged under hospice care.\\nDysphagia is an underrecognized but significant complication of cervical fusion surgeries. The incidence of esophageal perforation after anterior cervical spine surgery is estimated to be between 0.02% and 1.49% with a mortality rate of 6%. Most esophageal erosions occur in the intraoperative or immediate postoperative setting, although there has been an increase in cases with delayed presentation, which often lead to dramatic clinical deterioration with a higher mortality risk of 20-50%. Most esophageal injuries are due to iatrogenic injury intraoperatively from inappropriate placement or dislodgement of retractors or hardware migration. Delayed injuries are typically due to chronic compression, abscess formation, repetitive friction of the plating system, or hardware dislodgement and chronic migration. Diagnosis can be made with cervical radiographs; however negative imaging does not rule out esophageal injury. Operative intervention is recommended, but conservative medical treatment is appropriate depending on the patient and the clinical circumstances.\\nAlthough cervical endplate erosion of the esophagus has been well documented in the literature, hypopharyngeal erosion has only been reported once previously. It is imperative that health care providers are vigilant and complete a thorough workup in patients with persistent or worsening dysphagia who have undergone a previous anterior cervical surgery.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 58-year-old patient presented molar and canine Class II relationships on both sides (Figure 1). Maxillary and mandibular interincisal midlines did not coincide. Clinical intraoral examination showed the maxillary arch quite aligned, with mild rotations of the left incisors. On the other hand, the mandibular arch presented a multibraided fixed retainer bonded to all six anterior teeth with the right canine root lingually torqued. The root was exposed, almost revealing the apex, and the element was not vital. Elements 3.2 and 3.3 resulted retroclined, withdiastemas between elements 3.1-3.2 and 3.2-3.3, a 90  rotation of 3.3. Calculus in the fifth sextant, multiple recessions, and restorations were present.\\nA cone-beam computed tomography (Orthophos SL 3D, Sirona, Bensheim, Germany) was performed, confirming the former periodontal findings (Figure 2(a)). The root of the right canine was not covered by cortical bone anymore (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)).\\nClinicians suggested different solutions to the patient. The first alternative involved the extraction of all lower incisors and the right canine, followed by the placement of dental implants with guided surgery and, finally, a prosthetic rehabilitation. However, this alternative would have not solved the rotation of element 3.3. The second alternative considered every other prosthetic solution without implant placement, but it would have led to treatment failure as extracting lower cuspids would have meant removing the anchor teeth or pillars for the prosthetic rehabilitation. These alternatives were too invasive and radical, in particular, the former alternative could have led to failures and peri-implantitis.\\nThe most conservative solution was fixed orthodontic treatment with multibracket appliance aiming at preserving the affected teeth. This option was the least invasive, but it could have been complex from a biomechanical point of view and challenging for the retrieval of the right canine, with poor prognosis. Consequently, after being informed of all risks and having signed an informed consent, the patient chose to undergo orthodontic treatment only for the lower arch.\\nThe primary objective was to correctly reposition the mandibular right canine, in order to avoid the placement of a dental implant or fixed dental bridge. As the patient requested a noninvasive treatment, it was decided to start fixed orthodontic treatment only on the lower arch.\\nAfter the removal of the fixed retainer, periodontal probing, supra and subgingival professional oral hygiene was performed. Periodontal probing and supragingival oral hygiene sessions were repeated if needed for calculus accumulations during all orthodontic treatment. A multibracket treatment was performed with the MTB technique. Brackets (3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA) were bonded from elements 3.5 to 4.5, and molar bands with double tubes (3M Unitek) were cemented to elements 3.6 and 4.6. On the lingual side of molar bands, Wilson 3D lingual tubes (Rocky Mountain Orthodontics, Denver, USA) with vertical insertion were welded. In order to obtain additional torque on the right mandibular canine, a lower second premolar bracket (3M Unitek) was bonded. A 0.012-in NiTi archwire 3M (Figure 3) was ligated. A Wilson 3D sectional archwire (Rocky Mountain Orthodontics) was inserted on element 4.6 (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)) as an additional lingual/apical force became necessary to help the root apex return in the alveolar bone base. Its mesial extremity was placed on the most apical point of the root of the right canine, distant from lingual mucosa. The lingual sectional was removed after three months of treatment. Meanwhile, the following arch sequence was used: 0.014-in NiTi (Figure 5), 0.016-in NiTi, and a 0.019 x 0.025-in NiTi (3M Unitek). Light archwires were used for a long time in order to achieve a good alignment; considering the age of the patient, continuous and light forces were exerted to respect periodontal tissues. Subsequently, a 0.019 x 0.025-in TMA (3M Unitek) was used. Additional torque was progressively added on the right canine for the next three months. Treatment continued with the addition of radicular-vestibular torque on the IV quadrant and an elastic chain (3M Unitek) applied to close spaces.\\nThe multibracket treatment lasted a year and a half. The mandibular right canine was repositioned (Figure 6) and a periodontal examination showed probing pocket depth values of 3 mm. In addition, the general dentist decided to perform root canal treatment of the canine one year after the beginning of orthodontic treatment as the tooth was not vital and not symptomatic. Elements 3.2 and 3.3 were repositioned too, and spaces were closed (Figure 7).\\nA spring retainer was delivered to the patient (Figure 8). It consisted of an anterior stainless-steel wire with vestibular and lingual resin components. The latter extended to the molars to improve stability.\\nThe patient was visited after 1, 5, 12, and 18 months from the end of the orthodontic treatment. The stability of the results was observed after 18 months (Figure 9). The patient was satisfied by the result of the therapy but was aware that unwanted tooth movement could occur in the upper arch anyway as she excluded every kind of retention. The patient will continue to be under close observation through regular follow-up examinations.',\n",

He underwent an uneventful ACL reconstruction ten years before, with total functional recovery and no instability or pain symptoms after full rehabilitation postoperative program. For ACL graft fixation, a bioabsorbable crosspin was used at the femur and a bioabsorbable interference screw was used at the tibia. The patient reported that he did not suffer any trauma, increased sports activity level, or other remarkable events in the weeks or months prior to the moment when pain and effusion started. The patient was first treated at another centre where femoral crosspin loosening was noted. After a magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed an intact ACL graft and no other complications, the patient underwent surgery for the removal of a femoral crosspin.\\nOne month after femoral crosspin removal surgery, effusion and pain persisted. Then, the patient was evaluated at our hospital for the first time. Physical exploration showed swelling at the lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle (Figure 1). A rounded, cyst-like mass with well-defined borders was evident at palpation. No local signs of infection were found. Lachman, pivot-shift, and anterior and posterior drawer tests were negative, with a full range of motion and no valgus or varus instability at physical exploration. Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the knee showed adequate tunnel position and no tunnel widening.\\nSuspected diagnosis was postsurgical seroma. Treatment included percutaneous drainage, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). Samples from the drained seroma were sent for microbiological analysis and culture, with no bacterial ingrowth. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment was prescribed until a negative result of synovial fluid cultures was obtained. Initial evolution was satisfactory, with complete symptom release for 6 months. After this period, recurrent swelling at the lateral aspect of the knee reappeared and remained despite percutaneous drainage. A cyst-like rounded mass was palpable at the same location of previous episodes. Physical exploration was similar to our first evaluation; no local or systemic infection symptoms were found.\\nMRI showed a cyst formation at the lateral aspect of the knee, with fluid signal in the graft femoral tunnel and around the crosspin tunnel entrance at the lateral cortex of the lateral femoral condyle (Figure 2).\\nSurgical treatment in collaboration with plastic surgery was carried out. With the patient in supine position and under ischaemia of the leg, standard knee arthroscopy was carried out. Full knee arthroscopic exploration showed an intact ACL graft with no meniscal or articular cartilage lesions. No widening of the femoral or tibial ACL graft tunnels was noted, and neither was there any graft loosening. During arthroscopy, as a result of fluid inflow to the knee, the lateral cyst increased in size, making it more perceptible at the lateral aspect of the knee. This finding confirmed that a fistula was connecting the knee joint to the lateral condyle; as noted in the previous MRI, this fistula was the origin of the cyst. No signs of septic arthritis were found. After knee arthroscopy, the operation proceeded with open surgery through a lateral approach using the previous surgical scarf from the crosspin removal surgery. The lateral cortex of the lateral femoral condyle was exposed. The hole at the cortical bone of the lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle, caused by the drilling carried out to introduce the crosspin used for femoral ACL graft fixation, persisted (Figure 3) with rounded soft tissue burn. At the lateral aspect of the femoral condyle, a cyst-like cavity was found. Once opened, it was filled with synovial fluid and no capsule or synovial tissue surrounded the cyst; however, it has dissected a cavity between bone cortical and deep muscular fascia. No signs of local infection were present. At the lateral end of the femoral tunnel, where the tunnel from the removed crosspin persisted, a burned bone was also noted. The bone tunnel end was surrounded with devitalized bone with negative paprika sign and sclerotic edges; bone edges and surrounding soft tissues were darkened due to burning during drilling. Owing to a small tunnel width of 10 mm, arthroscopic exploration introducing an arthroscope through the tunnel was not possible. The cyst was excised, and burned bone was refreshed until a bleeding marrow bone bed was obtained.\\nThe bone tunnel was filled with autologous marrow bone graft before covering the cortical bone defect with local fascial flap. Postoperative course was uneventful and total recovery was achieved.\\nThree years after the femoral tunnel revision surgery, the patient remained with full functional recovery and without any clinical symptoms, effusion, or pain recurrence.',\n",

His pretreatment best corrected visual acuity was 20/30-1 OD and 20/30 OS. \\nPer review of the records, crosslinking was performed in both eyes using an epithelium-on protocol. Riboflavin was instilled every 5 minutes, as was proparacaine every 10 minutes, for 90 minutes until saturation of the corneal stroma was noted using a hand light. Fractionation was performed at 15 seconds on and 15 seconds off of UV light at a 3.0 inch distance with an energy of 3.0 mW/cm2 (measured by an energy meter). There were no reported complications. The corneal epithelium was intact after the procedure. A bandage contact lens (BCTL) was placed over both eyes and the patient was prescribed moxifloxacin 0.5% QID OU for 1 week, bromfenac 0.07% QID OU for 1 week, and prednisolone acetate 1% QID OU over 4 weeks that would be tapered slowly. \\nOn post-treatment day 4, the patient returned to the outside clinic complaining of severe pain OS starting the night before. There were new superficial corneal opacities, a hypopyon, and possible corneal perforation OS. A culture was performed, the BCTL was removed, bromfenac and prednisolone were discontinued OS and the patient was transferred to the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute (GHEI) for further care.\\nWhen the patient arrived at GHEI his vision was 20/70 OD and hand motion (HM) OS. The left eye exhibited diffuse conjunctival injection, a diffuse corneal infiltrate with gross ectasia and perforation along with a diffuse hypopyon. The right eye appeared to be unaffected. An emergent penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and anterior chamber washout was recommended. The transplantation and washout were performed without complication and the patient was started on prednisolone acetate 1% and moxifloxacin 0.5% QID OS and ordered to continue prednisolone acetate 1% QID OD and moxifloxacin 0.5% QID OD per the referring doctor.\\nOn postoperative day one from the PKP OS, the patient complained about new pain, irritation, and decreased visual acuity OD as well. He was using all recommended medications as described above. His visual acuity was HM OD and 20/80 OS. The right eye conjunctiva was injected and its cornea had a new 5 mm central infiltrate with an equally sized epithelial defect, an apical bulge and new purulent discharge. All of these findings were felt to be consistent with impending perforation. The left was healing appropriately. There was no evidence of recurrent infection OS and his IOP measured 21 mmHg by Tonopen. Given that the patient had a new epithelial defect, infiltrate and impending corneal perforation, we recommended a penetrating keratoplasty OD. \\nOn postoperative day one PKP OD, postoperative day two PKP OS, cultures returned from the first PKP OS showing many colonies of pan-resistant methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient was recommended to undergo directed topical fortified vancomycin every 2 hours, topical trimethoprim/polymyxin B ointment every 2 hours OU, topical prednisolone acetate 1% QID OU, aggressive lubrication with nonpreserved artificial tears along with oral doxycycline and ascorbate. \\nGiven the severity of the patient's course and no clear source for the MRSA, we recommended that the patient and his family be tested for MRSA, noting that his daughter had a tracheostomy. The patient later reported that he and his daughter wer positive for MRSA. He was given a course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol (TMP/SMX) by his primary care physician.\\nBy post-PKP month 3, his CDVA was 20/20 OU with a rigid gas permeable CTL.

He had been undergoing hemodialysis for past 15 years for chronic kidney disease of unknown origin. Computed tomography (CT) showed a poorly enhanced tumor within the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 1.4 cm x 3.6 cm x 2.2 cm with multiple-lymph node involvement including para-aortic, retrocrural, and supraclavicular lymph nodes ( Figure 1 ). Metastasis to distant organ was not detected. A clinical diagnosis of RCC (cT3aN1M1) was made, and the patient was referred to our hospital for treatment.\\nAs the patient was symptomatic from the local disease and was already on hemodialysis, radical nephrectomy and para-aortic lymph node biopsy were performed. The pathological characteristics of this case has already been published. Histologically, the tumor consisted of rhabdoid cells, with notable lymphocyte infiltration and large areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was negative for SMARCB1, and PD-L1 expression was observed in 20% of cells ( Supplementary Data 1 ). All sampled lymph nodes were positive for malignancy. Because the patient had no evidence of sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, he was diagnosed as having RCCU-MP (pT3a, pN1).\\nOne month after nephrectomy, the baseline CT scan showed para-aortic lymph node measuring 40 mm x 30 mm, retrocrural lymph node measuring 27 mm x 19 mm, and left supraclavicular lymph node measuring 23 mm x 21 mm. We administered a combined immune checkpoint blockade therapy with nivolumab at a dose of 240 mg and ipilimumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks as induction therapy for the management of residual lesions. After four cycles of induction therapy without grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events, follow-up CT revealed partial responses with a substantial decrease in the size of the affected lymph nodes ( Supplementary Data 2 ). The patient became afebrile, and his performance status evidently improved by the induction therapy. In addition, there was a significant reduction in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.\\nTaking the results into consideration, we considered induction therapy to be effective, and the patient continued maintenance therapy with nivolumab at a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks. After 15 months of maintenance nivolumab therapy without disease progression, the patient presented with left lower limb edema because of left common and external iliac lymphadenopathy. Palliative radiation therapy at a dose of 50 Gy relieved the patient's symptoms.\\nHowever, after 1 month, his blood test results showed abnormal liver function, and CT revealed obstructive jaundice requiring biliary drainage. We considered this situation as disease progression, discontinued nivolumab, and switched the therapy to chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Chemotherapy was discontinued after two cycles due to declined performance status and side effects of myalgia. The patient received best supportive care and died 2 months later due to disease progression. The total time span between diagnosis and death was 28 months.\\nTo explore the longitudinal change in the profile of circulating T lymphocytes during ICI treatment, we performed mass cytometry and multicolor flow cytometry analysis of PBMCs isolated from the patient's blood samples, which were obtained at three different time points: beginning, end of induction therapy, and when the disease had progressed. This analysis was conducted according to the protocol described by Kagamu et al..\\nPBMC samples obtained before treatment and at the completion of induction therapy, when treatment response was evident, were subjected to mass cytometry. Mass cytometry data visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) technique revealed an apparent increase in stem cell memory and central memory CD8+ T cells expressing CD62L, CCR7, and CD27 ( Figure 2A ) . This finding was supported by multicolor flow cytometry analysis showing an increase in the proportion of central memory (CD45RA-CCR7+) and naive (CD45RA+CCR7+) CD8+ T cells after induction therapy, whereas the proportion of effector (CD45RA+CCR7-) and effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-) CD8+ T cells decreased ( Supplementary Data 3A ). A similar increase in the stem-like population was also observed in CD4+ T cells ( Figure 2B ). Upon treatment resistance, the proportion of effector T cells increased significantly and the proportion of central memory and naive CD8+ T cells decreased ( Supplementary Data 3A ). Multicolor flow cytometry analysis also revealed that the population expressing exhaustion markers such as PD-1+, LAG-3+, and CTLA-4+ consistently increased upon treatment resistance across all CD8+ T cells and Th1 CD4+ cells ( Supplementary Data 3B ). In addition, the fraction of CD62LlowCD4+ T cells among total CD4+ T cells before treatment, a parameter previously reported to be associated with response to ICI in non-small cell lung cancer, was 39.6%, classifying the present case to the responder group.\",\n",

The pain started gradually but was constant and sharp in nature. Upon physical examination, she was jaundiced. The abdominal exam was remarkable for hepatomegaly and a gravid uterus. The neurological exam was normal. The patient denied use of any hepatotoxic medications. Her labs were completely normal about three weeks earlier. Initial laboratory workup showed a leucocyte count of 12.0 x 109/L (70% neutrophils), platelet count of 450 x 109/L, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, total bilirubin of 6.4 mg/dl (direct fraction 5.0 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 83 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 87 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 319 U/l, glucose of 66 mg/dL, LDH of 679 U/L, uric acid of 4.2 mg/dL, and total serum bile acids of 71 mumol/L (ref. 0-19 mumol). Prothrombin time was 17 seconds with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4. Viral hepatitis serology, autoimmune marker, and ceruloplasmin test results were unremarkable. The urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was elevated with 24 hours of collection for urine protein, 1300 mg/day; her 24-hour urine protein was 180 mg/day prior to pregnancy. Ultrasonography showed marked hepatomegaly (~27 cm), fatty infiltration of the liver, and a right hepatic hypoechoic 2.8 cm mass (Figure 1). Moreover, the liver exhibited heterogenous echotexture along with areas of nodular contour. Given the patients' clinical presentation, biochemical profile, and imaging findings, the obstetricians suspected AFLP. The patient underwent delivery by Cesarean section; however, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels gradually increased after delivery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was obtained three days after delivery for further evaluation of the mass and worsening liver function (Figure 2). MRI showed a heterogeneous T2 hyperintense mass involving the majority of the left hepatic lobe, measuring approximately 11.2 x 9.2 x 5.8 cm. There was an additional similar, smaller lesion within the right hepatic lobe, measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.1 cm. There were additional satellite lesions within the left hepatic lobe. There was mild, diffuse intrahepatic biliary dilation. Serum tumor markers were obtained and showed elevated cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) of >10,000 U/ml, CEA of 160.5 ng/mL (normal up to 5.20), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of 1,135 ng/mL. US guided biopsy tissue obtained from the smaller right hepatic mass showed adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. A CT scan of the chest showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastasis. Total bilirubin started to increase gradually, up to 14.0 mg/dL. The patient underwent placement of percutaneous biliary drains with subsequent improvement of her total bilirubin to 4.0 mg/dL. She was then started on palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine; however, this was complicated by recurrent episodes of cholangitis with multidrug-resistant organisms. She also developed progressive disease and peritoneal carcinomatosis and was subsequently transitioned into hospice care. She died around six months after her original presentation.\",\n",

In the patient's four previous births, the first and second children were delivered by full-term spontaneous deliveries at another hospital without ANC, and the third and fourth children were delivered at the patient's home without medical assistance. The mother and her children had not been diagnosed with syphilis. During the examination, the patient appeared healthy with a blood pressure of 118/81 mmHg, a pulse rate of 78 bpm, and a body temperature of 37.2 C. The gestational age was estimated by her last menstrual period to be approximately 31 weeks. Abdominal examination revealed a soft, nontender uterus. Ultrasound evaluation confirmed a single fetus in cephalic presentation with an estimated body weight of 1,500 g and no evidence of placental abruption. Vaginal examination showed the cervix to be 30% effaced and 2 cm dilated with an intact membrane. Laboratory findings revealed elevated white blood cell counts (11,670/muL) and C-reactive protein levels (1.63 mg/dL).\\nFHR monitoring at the initial evaluation showed several early decelerations and bradycardia to 50 bpm for a one-minute period prior to recovery to normal baseline in association with a painless uterine contraction. The patient was immediately placed in the lateral position followed by the administration of oxygen via a face mask and a rapid intravenous infusion of fluid. The baseline variability was within a normal range. Twenty-five minutes later, another prolonged bradycardia to 70 bpm for a 7-minute period prior to recovery to normal baseline occurred without a uterine contraction. A decision was made to deliver immediately by cesarean section. Tocolysis was not performed during the course of treatment. A female neonate covered with a thick meconium weighing 1,423 g with Apgar scores of 2 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes was delivered. Umbilical arterial pH was 7.28. After resuscitation, the neonate was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. The neonate was assessed to be 31 weeks at birth using the Dubowitz score and was diagnosed with an intrauterine infection. Routine investigations were performed to determine the nature of the infection. \\nFollowing cesarean section, the mother was diagnosed with syphilis by a serological test. Congenital syphilis was confirmed by serology of the neonate: rapid plasma region 32x, Treponema pallidum hemagglutination 1280x, and a positive immunoglobulin fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test. Histopathological examination of the placenta, umbilical cord, and membranes revealed severe CAM and necrotizing funisitis; inflammatory cells could be seen on the surface of the cord and within Wharton jelly. Numerous T. pallidum were detected by IHC, which uses an antibody against T. pallidum (Figure 1). Both mother and neonate were treated with penicillin with good results. The neonate did not have any skin lesions or radiological bone changes and was discharged after 56 days with no evidence of sequela.\",\n",

Additional demographic information appears on Table 2.\\nIt is important to mention that Conductor A, once the interviews were completed, joined the research team to contribute to the data analysis. While she was unaware (during the time she was conducting one of the virtual bands) that the transition from in-person rehearsals to virtual ones would become a specific focus for research within this context, her contribution to the analysis provided a valuable insider perspective and significantly enriched the credibility and trustworthiness of the analysis.\\nThe virtual bands\\' rehearsals were recorded and made available to ensemble members during the semester. Permission to record was asked at the beginning of each semester and participants who felt uncomfortable being recorded were suggested to keep their camera off. Unlike regular in-person rehearsals, the majority of the online band rehearsals were held in a sectional format, with musicians being split into their instrument families (woodwinds; Brass and percussion). Full band rehearsals were held three times during the semester:one at the beginning, one approximately in the middle, and one at the end of the term. Typical rehearsals usually started with announcements (if needed) or a question period, which was followed by a brief warm-up done with the full band. While most of the time all musicians had to be muted to adequately hear the conductor\\'s sound source, for warm-ups and slower chorale-like pieces, it was possible to have everyone unmute and play together. The ensemble was then separated into break-out rooms for sectionals or stayed together during full band rehearsals to work on pieces. Repertoire chosen for online music instruction were mostly flex band1 arrangements to allow more freedom regarding parts assignments. The rehearsal ended with a run-through of a piece (time permitting) or a question period. During rehearsals, musicians played along with either the conductor on keyboards or with recordings of the repertoire. Recordings were manipulated to be slower tempi using AudioTrimmer. Occasionally, musicians also received music theory and music history lessons during rehearsals. Both bands concluded their semesters with members individually recording themselves playing a selected piece to be put together for a \"virtual concert\" video (for more details on rehearsal structure, please refer to Supplementary Appendix 1).\\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted in French or English, based on the mother tongue of participants, and lasted approximately 45 min. All interviews occurred in July 2021, during summer break, after the end of all online activities. Interviews were transcribed in their original language. French quotes that were selected for analysis were translated to facilitate interpretation using DeepL, checked for clarity by a researcher fluent in French, and validated by the research team. Quotes that were selected to be included in the analysis were then sent back to each participant individually, to ensure that the written transcriptions were a representative depiction of his/her thoughts and experience.\\nThe format of the interview consisted of 13 open-ended questions (Supplementary Appendix 2) that addressed three themes: (1) intergenerational relationships, (2) digital literacy and access in later-life, and (3) online music-making in a pandemic context. The intent was to seek participants\\' perspectives in relation to these themes, with questions such as: \"You participated in a virtual ensemble that was intergenerational. Do you feel that this intergenerational context may have improved your learning experience? If so, how?\" (Theme 1); \"How can virtual music-making maximize equitable access in later-life to creative musical expression, engagement in learning, digital literacy and quality of life amongst older citizens?\" (Theme 2); or \"What implications has the shift to an online environment had for you as a musician (or teacher)? What new skills or resources have you had to develop, in response to opportunities or challenges raised by the pandemic?\" (Theme 3).\\nFollowing the guidelines set out by, p. 83-85), theoretical thematic analysis was undertaken, meaning that data analysis was based on the researchers\\' specific areas of interest and focused on specific aspects of the data rather than the entire dataset. Analysis was undertaken primarily at the \"semantic\" (or explicit) level, establishing patterns between extracts, and then attempting to understand their significance and establish their broader meanings in an iterative process. A research assistant, in charge of coding the data, was supervised by the main researcher through the first stage of analysis. Afterward, a second researcher checked the coding process and contributed to its improvement. Codes were reorganized as needed, based on a deductive approach. Participants\\' perceptions of transitioning from in-person rehearsals to online rehearsals was examined from two perspectives: those of the teachers (adult band conductors) and those of the students (older adult band members). Results were combined to facilitate interpretation when trends were observed.',\n",

In the preceding three days, she had noted asthenia and had fallen at home three times. Her past history included Crohn's disease treated by sulfasalazine and a beta-Lactam allergy. She also had congestive heart failure due to valvular disease and hypertension. She had not received influenza vaccine. Physical examination on admission revealed a temperature of 39 C. Her pulse rate was 110 beats per minute and her blood pressure was 150/60 mmHg. She had dyspnea with orthopnea, and her respiratory rate was 30 per minute. On auscultation, there were wheezing, rhonchi, and crepitations at the bases of both lungs. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable except for severe functional decline. Laboratory studies showed a white cell count of 14.600 x 109/L (with 12.900 x 109/L neutrophils), a C-reactive protein level of 154 mg/L and a B-type natriuretic peptide of 770 ng/L. Arterial blood gases on room air were pH 7.34, pO2 67 mmHg, pCO2 37 mmHg, and O2 saturation of 90%. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. It was concluded that the patient had congestive heart failure and acute febrile illness without localizing symptoms. Therapy was initiated with oxygen, diuretics, and intravenous erythromycin.\\nOver the two next days, the patient remained febrile (38.5 C) despite antibiotic treatment and had abdominal pain. She had no signs of severe sepsis or circulatory failure. She had a blood pressure of 150/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 per minute, and O2 saturation of 93% on room air. On chest examination, there were persistent rhonchi with cough which produced white sputum. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Her white count cell was 8.100 x 109/L (6.900 x 109/L neutrophils) and the C-reactive protein level was 275 mg/L. A chest x-ray showed right basal consolidation. Urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were negative. Abdominal echography was performed and was within normal limits. It was finally concluded that the patient had pneumonia with persistent fever despite antibiotics. Antibiotic cover was extended to include ofloxacin and the patient was admitted the following day to our acute geriatric ward. On admission, her temperature was 38 C and chest examination was the same as described earlier. Sputum for viral examination was collected because the patient had a productive cough, but bacteriologic examination was not performed due to antibiotics. A rapid detection test on sputum by direct fluorescent antibody assay was positive for influenza A in a few hours, with confirmation a few days later by culture. The patient's condition deteriorated on the same day and she succumbed to fatal respiratory distress syndrome.\",\n",

The blood pressure was measured routinely and was within normal range.\\nThe initial laboratory hormonal analysis and tumor markers aimed to identify hormonal activity by the tumor or possible malignancy (Table 1). The results did not reveal any deviation from the normal values.\\nThe computer tomography images showed a well-defined capsulated retroperitoneal extrarenal oval lesion with heterogeneous cystic structure measuring 7.5 x 8.5 cm, native HU 5 to 95 without change after contrast enhancement (Fig. 1).\\nUltrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed and a pig-tail drainage was placed due to the cystic appearance of the formation and the lack of certain diagnosis from the non-invasive diagnostic test. Cytological examination revealed a monomorphic population of cells with loose-textured cytoplasm and central lymphocytic-like cores with small nucleoli around a multitude of erythrocytes. No signs of cellular and nuclear atypism were observed. The drain discharged 80 ml of hemorrhagic fluid in the first 24 h and after being inactive in the next 24 h it was removed. The diagnosis of benign endothelial cyst with spontaneous hemorrhage was suggested due to imaging data suggesting a cystic lesion, the hemorrhagic characteristics of the drained fluid and the cytology analysis. The patient was observed for two days and discharged with no complains, normal vital signs and no significant change in the blood cell count. The hormonal status was to be evaluated on follow-up.\\nTwo months later further increase in patients BMI to 30.2 kg/m2 was observed. Striae and inner thighs acanthosis remained. Additional hormonal laboratory tests ruled out adrenal pathology (Table 2). The elevated 24 h urine cortisol was related to obesity.\\nAbdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed and demonstrated decrease of the cyst dimensions to 52 x 50 mm (Fig. 2). The patient was scheduled for elective surgery, but due to the COVID-19 pandemics and cancellation of elective surgical procedures on national scale, the treatment was postponed.\\nThe patient underwent surgery 3 months after the initial hospitalization. Despite the initial plan to perform cystectomy, the intimate adhesion of the lesion to the adrenal gland and vena cava inferior necessitated en-bloc adrenalectomy to prevent spillage of the cyst content (Fig. 3). The specimen was extracted with an EndoBag.\\nNo postoperative adverse events and complications were registered and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day.\\nThe gross pathological description was of a lesion with dimensions 50 x 42 x 43 mm. The tumor appeared black-brown with a shining surface due to its cellular pigmentation (Fig. 4).\\nThe pathomorphological description was of a tumor formation with fibrous capsule composed of drained Schwann-like cells with fasciculation, vesicular nuclei with relatively small nucleoli visualized, mitosis 6/10 high-power field (HPF), with varying amount of melanin pigment in single and groups of cells. Connective tissue stroma separated tumor cell aggregates with an abundance of psammoma bodies (calcium deposits) and foci of necrosis and hemorrhage in the tumor parenchyma. The adrenal gland was intact with no tumor infiltration (Fig. 5).\\nThe markers S100 protein, melan-A and melanosome clone HMB45 had high-intensity expression in the tumor. Individual cells expressed inhibin alpha, Chromogranin A and Ki 67 to about 10 to 15% (Fig. 6).\\nThe findings were conclusive of malignant psammomatous melanotic schwannoma.

       "    'case_text': \"A 30-year-old female presented to our hospital on December 4, 2017 due to a 4-month-old mass on her left breast. She did not complain of pain, dizziness, headache, or any other discomfort, and did not report any relevant family history. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass, 6x5 cm in size, at 3 o'clock on the left breast. No enlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the armpit. Ultrasound light scattering breast examination revealed a hypoechoic nodule, approximately 3.68x2.77 cm in size, in the outer quadrant of the left areola and an areola with indistinct borders. Multiple, enlarged, left axillary lymph nodes were also observed and the tumor was graded as 4C according to the breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS). No obvious abnormalities were observed in the right breast. A needle biopsy of the mass in the left breast was performed on December 18, 2017 and pathological analysis revealed that it was an invasive carcinoma (non-special type III) (Figure 1) that was HER-2 2+, ER 10%, PR 5%, Ki-67 30%, and FISH test positive. Therefore, further whole body assessment was performed, and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and head (Figure 2A) revealed a mass with abnormal density or shadows in both breasts, with bilateral multiple enlarged axillary lymph nodes and circular low-density plaques with a diameter of about 3 cm in the right frontal lobe. Moreover, because head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 2B) showed that the right frontal lobe was abnormally enhanced and occupied, the possibility of metastasis was considered based on her medical history.Further, needle biopsy of the tumor on the right breast and pathological test results revealed the absence of cancerous tissue. Other related tests such as bone scan and abdominal CT did not reveal any remarkable results. Based on the above observations, she was diagnosed with HER-2 positive breast cancer (left) according to the eighth edition of the American Cancer Society (AJCC) standard diagnosis. Meanwhile, the cancer was staged as T3N2M1 stage IV. As the patient was young and had no history of childbirth, Goserelin (3.6 mg, subcutaneous injection) was immediately initiated with a 28-day cycle. She also underwent four cycles of AC (cyclophosphamide + pirarubicin) chemotherapy on January 6 and 28, and February 10 and 26, 2018. Next, she was administered three cycles of TH (trastuzumab + docetaxel) chemotherapy on March 14, April 7, and April 29, 2018, along with antiemetic, white blood cell elevators, and other comprehensive treatments. Chemotherapy progressed without complications, and after seven cycles of chemotherapy, the mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast was found to be significantly smaller than before (2 x 1 cm) upon physical examination. CT scans of the chest (Figure 2C) suggested that the axillary lymph nodes and abnormal mass in the left breast had reduced in size. The patient underwent a modified radical mastectomy for left breast cancer on May 15, 2018, in the breast surgery department of our hospital and evaluation of resected tissue (Figure 3) showed an invasive carcinoma (non-special type, grade III). Immunohistochemically, the tissue was typed as ER 20%, PR 10%, HER-2 (2+ -3+), and Ki-67 40%, and no FISH test performed. HP (Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab) regimen targeted therapy was given on May 24, 2018 and tamoxifen 20 mg, once a day, was prescribed as endocrine therapy from July 2018 onwards. Radiation therapy was initiated on July 28, 2018, and the sites were left chest wall, left upper and lower clavicle, and left axilla. PTV was set at DT5000cGy/25f with a dose separation of 200 cGy/session, five times a week. The patient complained of headaches, mostly located on the right side, with intermittent dull pain in October 2018, and MRI of the head showed no change in abnormal enhancement of the right frontal lobe. Therefore, she was transferred to the neurosurgery department of our hospital and an intracranial mass was resected on October 23, 2018. Postoperative analysis of the resected tissue (Figure 4) showed that the tumor cells were small sized, arranged tightly, and localized, with significant proliferation of small blood vessels. Immunohistochemically, the tissue was ckp (-), GFAP (3+), Ki-67 (<5%), p53 (-). Morphology and immunohistochemistry supported glial cell proliferation, consistent with a localized glioma (WHO Grade I). The patient was regularly followed-up after surgery and her condition remained stable during this period. Further, during follow-up consultation on May 6, 2020, she did not complain of dizziness or headache. However, a repeat head MRI showed (Figure 2D) that the right frontal lobe was abnormally enhanced and that it was slightly larger than before. Therefore, a frontal lobe tumor resection was performed again in the neurosurgery department on May 14, 2020. Postoperative examination of the tissue (Figure 5) showed that the tumor cells were extremely diverse, ie, they were oval, fusiform, or star-shaped, and both sparse or dense with some having less cytoplasm and others having more. Some tumor cells were atypical, a few had large and darkly stained nuclei with visible nucleoli and occasional mitotic structures, while others showed hypertrophy or an offset nucleus, or were rich in cytoplasm or interstitial blood vessels. However, no clear necrosis was seen. Immunohistochemically the resected tissue was S-100 (3+), sox10 (mildly +), Ki-67 (5%, local 5-10%), p53 (mildly +), CD34 (vascular endothelium +), ckp (-), GFAP (small part +), and NSE (-), and when combined with morphology, these findings supported a diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II). CT imaging of the chest and abdomen performed (Figure 2E) at follow-up on November 23, 2020 revealed expected postoperative changes in the left breast with no obvious abnormal masses or shadows. However, an abnormally enhanced shadow, approximately 20x20 mm in size, was observed on the liver (S6 segment). Given the patient's disease progression, liver metastasis was diagnosed and she underwent two cycles of chemotherapy with pyrotinib and capecitabine. Repeat chest and abdominal CT performed on January 13, 2021 showed abnormal enhancement and enlargement of the right lobe of the liver. Hence, two cycles of TPH (trastuzumab + docetaxel + cisplatin) chemotherapy were administered on January 22, 2021 and February 17, 2021. A whole abdomen enhanced CT on March 11, 2021, revealed (Figure 2F) that the abnormal enhancement of the lobe was about 35x26 mm in size and larger than that seen previously. A liver biopsy was performed and pathology reported (Figure 6) that the tissue was relatively fragmented with little liver tissue seen in some areas. The tumor tissue was composed of short spindle or oval cells arranged in diffuse sheets with abundant blood vessels and a small amount of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunohistochemically the tissue was ckp (-), Her-2 (-), vimentin (+), Ki-67 (15%), SMA (-), Desmin (-), CD34 (vascular +), CD31 (vascular +), Hepatocyte (-), GPC-3 (-), CK19 (-), HMB45 (+), Melan-A (+), GFAP (-), sox10 (-), S-100 (-), GATA- 3 (-), ER (-), PR (-), and CD117 (focal 1+); therefore, a vascular tumor was suspected and the patient was transferred to the General Surgery Department of our hospital, where she underwent laparoscopic resection of the liver lesions on March 24, 2021. No tumor tissue was seen at the resection margin of the liver and the patient recovered well after surgery. Postoperative pathological report (Figure 7) described the liver structure as destroyed with unclear tumor tissue boundaries and no capsules. Tumor cells were spindle shaped with visible pathological mitoses and the nucleus was fusiform or polygonal with an increase in both cell number and volume. The ratio of nucleoplasm was also greater with more megakaryocytes and strange nuclei that were arranged in strips or were diffuse. Additionally, infiltrating growth, bleeding, and small lamellar necrosis, tissue congestion, edema, and lymphocyte infiltration were visible. The tissue was immunohistochemically characterized as Desmin (-), H-caldesmon (-), D2-40 (-), NSE (-), inhibitor-alpha (-), Syn (-), ckp (-), EMA (-), CD31 (vascular +), CD34 (vascular +), fli-1 (vascular +), ERG (vascular +), Ki-67 (10%), p53 (-), S-100 (-), Melan-A (+), HMB45 (-), CD117 (-), Hepatocyte (liver cell +), and CD68 (histocyte +). Morphological and immunohistochemical results were consistent with a malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa). After discharge from the hospital, goserelin once/28 days and letrozole 2.5 mg once/day were prescribed for treatment. The patient has been currently instructed to undergo chest and abdominal CT and head MRI every 3 months. At present, the patient's overall condition is good and she remains stable However, she refused to undergo genetic testing owing to economic reasons.\",\n",

However, she had no history of gastrointestinal problems. On admission, hyperpigmentation was observed on her lips, tongue and skin. Her speech and motor development were slightly delayed. Laboratory examinations revealed markedly elevated plasma ACTH (1,160 pg/ml), low serum cortisol (<1.1 mug/dl), low serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (<2 mug/dl), normal rennin activity (8.6 ng/ml), slightly low plasma aldosterone (21.4 pg/ml) and normal serum electrolyte levels (serum sodium 140 mmol/l, serum potassium 4.2 mmol/l, serum chloride 107 mmol/l). A rapid ACTH test revealed ACTH insensitivity (Table 1). Hydrocortisone replacement therapy was therefore started. Barium esophagography was unremarkable at this time. Although she had just two main features of ACTH-resistant adrenal insufficiency and alacrima, Allgrove syndrome was suspected. Institutional review board approval for AAAS gene analysis was obtained from the National Research Institute for Child Health and Development. Blood samples from the patient and her parents were collected after informed consent. Sequencing analysis of the AAAS gene was then performed, and a novel homozygous mutation was identified in our patient, involving the first base of the donor splice site of IVS7 (IVS7+1 G>A) (Fig. 1). Her parents were heterozygous for the same mutation. A few months after the diagnosis was established, she was noted to vomit intermittently up to several times a day. Considering her genetic diagnosis and symptom, we again performed esophagography and manometry on her. Measurement of esophageal pressures showed the pattern of achalasia.',\n",

On examination, he presented with wide-based gait, uncoordinated limb movements, and nystagmus on extreme gaze. Radiological investigations disclosed two bilateral hemispheric cerebellar lesions, suggestive of metastases [Figure 1]. On April 2020, he was then admitted to the C. Besta Neurological Institute (Milan, Italy), which was appointed as reference center for the treatment of neurooncological patients from other departments in Lombardy during the COVID-19 emergency period. In line with our triage protocol, the patient performed a nasopharyngeal swab for viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 detection with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by Allplex  2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) for amplification of RdRP, N and E genes. The test was positive and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed. The patient had a history of family exposure (the two daughters tested positive) and reported in the previous month only hyposmia and hypogeusia without rhinorrhea or nasal obstruction, which had resolved at the time of admission. Blood tests at admission revealed no significant abnormalities. A chest computed tomography (CT) reported a left pulmonary lesion suggestive of tumor in the absence of inflammatory changes [Figure 2]. According to our classification of urgency in category A+, meaning patients with intracranial tumors with mass effect or with progressive neurological deficit, without deterioration of consciousness, for which treatment is deferred for up to 10 days, two swabs were resampled after 7 days and both were still positive. Considering the neurological and radiological stability, it was established to perform three new swabs after a period of 7 days with negative results, leading the way to surgery. The two cerebellar lesions were then surgically removed with a pathological result of pulmonary adenocarcinoma metastases. In the early post-operative period, the patient manifested acute onset of psychotic symptoms with hyperactive delirium. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, and antipsychotic therapy was administered with quetiapine (up to 1 g/day); chlorpromazine and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine until control of the neuropsychiatric picture were obtained. Four days after surgery, the patient suddenly developed fever (up to 38.5 C) and acute respiratory failure. Another chest CT scan disclosed a radiological pattern of ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, suggesting a viral pneumonia [Figure 2]. Laboratory findings revealed an increased inflammatory response with higher white blood cell counts (15.94 x 109/L), higher neutrophil counts (14.54 x 109/L), lower lymphocyte counts (0.79 x 109/L), lower platelet count (66 x 109/L), increased D-dimer (1.77 mg/L), and C-reactive protein (229.8 mg/L) levels. Serological tests were performed using LIAISON  SARSCoV-2 S1/S2 IgG kit (Diasorin S.p.A, Saluggia, Italy), an indirect chemiluminescent immunoassay serology test for detecting IgG antibodies against S1/S2 antigens. An antibody level of 133 kAU/L was found (positive: >15.0 kAU/L). The RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Under the strong radiological and laboratory suspicion of pneumonia from COVID-19, a new RT-PCR was performed after 72 h which confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Oxygen therapy with alternating cycles of high-flow nasal cannula and low-flow venturi mask was administered until full recovery.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'We identified a Chinese family with HSAN (Figure 1A). The proband (II:1) was admitted to the Department of Orthopedics, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, for an ulcer near the left ankle and diagnosed with HSAN. The proband was a 14-year-old boy with an identical twin brother (II:2). They were born at term via cesarean section. The height and weight of the proband were 145 cm (<3%) and 26.5 kg (<3%), respectively, without any growth hormone imbalances, and his brother was 150 cm (<3%) tall, and weighed 29.0 kg (<3%), suggesting that they had growth retardation (without hormonal abnormalities).\\nThe proband had severely impaired pain sensitivity (Table 1). He consistently could not perceive noxious thermal/gelid stimuli or innocuous warm stimuli, which had resulted in the ankle ulcer and necrosis of the astragalus (Figures 1B,C). A nerve conduction study revealed peripheral nerve damage in the extremities, especially of the sensory nerves (Supplementary Table 2). The proband had moderate scoliosis (with a Cobb angle of 33 ) without centrum malformation (Figure 1D). The younger brother also exhibited HSAN, but his condition was clearly milder. The brothers presented with arthrogryposes of the fingers, foot extroversion, knee recurvation deformities, and myasthenia; hence, they achieved independent ambulation at 3 years of age (Figures 1E,F). The proband had thin blue scleras and corneal ulcers and was subsequently diagnosed with a cataract (Figure 1G). He also displays urinary incontinence. Furthermore, the proband was diagnosed with vascular structure abnormalities via centesis at 18 months of age. Their parents (I:1 and I:2) were unaffected.\\nAfter filtering the common variants from the 1000 Genomes Project, YH, ExAC, dbSNP132, and ESP databases, 571 unique SNPs were detected in the proband. The variants were filtered against 18 genes known to be involved in HSAN (Supplementary Table 1), and a set of three variants in two genes were identified in the proband (Table 2). By analyzing the bioinformatic predictions, inheritance patterns, OMIM clinical phenotypes, and American College of Medical Genetics classification (Richards et al.,) of these three genes, we strongly suspected that variants in DST (c.3304G>A, p.V1102I and c.13796G>A, p.R4599H) were the causative genetic variants in these patients.\\nSanger sequencing showed that the DST variant (c.3304G>A, p.V1102I) in the identical twins was inherited from their mother and the other (c.13796G>A, p.R4599H) was inherited from their father (Figures 2A,B). This finding indicates that the compound heterozygosity co-segregated within the affected family members. Neither variant was identified in the 200 control cohorts previously studied by our group. The amino acid sequence alignment analysis suggested that these two variants were both located in a highly evolutionarily conserved site (Figures 2C,D).\\nBy sequencing the peripheral blood RNA from I:2, II:1, and II:2 and excluding immunity-related proteins, we detected the down-regulated expression of ANKRD22, ICAM1/3, and BIRC5 in the HSAN-VI patients, suggesting changes in cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton, which is in accordance with the expectation that DST variants can alter cytoskeletal filament networks (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure 1). However, we did not observe any change in DST expression by RNAseq or qPCR (Figure 2E).',\n",

Our initial exam was on 24 October 2016. On exam, BCVA with Cycloplegic refraction were OD = -0.75-0.25 x 120 = 20/100, and OS = -0.50-0.50 x 70 = 20/100. Stereopsis was 400 seconds of arc. No relative afferent pupillary defect was noted. Intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg in both eyes. Pachymetry were 520/520 in both eyes.\\nOn fundus exam, he had 3-4+ optic disc pallor with 0.75 cupping. Macular OCT showed extensive macular thinning with normal structure [Figure 1a]. Ganglion cell layer (GCL) OCT revealed nearly complete GCL loss including central loss OU [Figures 1b and c]. This GCL loss was responsible for macular thinning. Three-dimensional OCT of the optic disc showed optic atrophy and our Pattern 4 IIH, 75% specific for IICP [Figure 1d]. In Pattern 4 IIH, there remains a hint of temporal wings, secondary to cerebrospinal fluid in the temporal retina. The average nerve fiber layer (ANFL) were 66 microns OD and 54 microns OS. Using a technique we have previously described, we measured 400 microns of papilledema in the right eye and 560 microns in the left eye on OCT. Our routine optic neuropathy workup for adults was performed. Vitamin D level was low and treated while Vitamin B12 levels were normal (678). Tests for collagen vascular disease, parathyroid hormone and Lyme disease were negative. Genetic tests for mutations in the DNA of mitochondria that are associated with LHON, including MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes, were sent to another laboratory. Interestingly, 85% of females and 50% of males with these mutated genes never show signs of LHON.\\nBrain MRI was considered normal by radiologist. However, in one axial cut, we interpreted more than 2 mm of CSF in the optic nerve near the globe [Figures 2a and c] and a small hygroma, which is very unusual at a young age and may be a sign of increased ICP [Figure 2b]. With a tentative diagnosis of PTC, the patient was referred to a neurologist for a spinal tap. The opening intracranial pressure in lateral decubitus position was 180 mm-H2O (normal range in children is up to 210 mm-H2O).\\nAlthough this pressure was not considered high in recent reference intervals, other clinical signs were compatible with IIH, and there was no risk in initiating treatment with acetazolamide (125 mg PO QID). Two months later, the boy's headaches were completely absent and his BCVA had improved to 20/30 in each eye. At a four-month follow up, BCVA was stable at 20/30 per eye and stereopsis had improved to 80 seconds of arc. Repeat OCT of the macula showed consistent thinning as before [Figure 3a]. OCT of GCL showed improvement in GCL with a central opening, explaining the improved visual acuity in both eyes [Figures 3b and c]. On optic nerve OCT, ANFL decreased to 40 microns OD and 44 microns OS [Figure 3d].\\nExactly one year later, VA and OCTs [Figure 4] were stable, despite some increase in ANFL from the original improvement seen after four months of treatment, and some non-significant thickening of macula and thus increased GCL. Stereopsis improved to 50 seconds of arc. The patient remained on 125 mg Diamox (acetazolamide) PO QID.\\nConflict of Interest Statement: The authors have no conflict of interest in this article.\",\n",

Although initially she had relief with analgesics, subsequently did not respond and associated with swelling over the left ankle which affected her daily work and sleep. There were no pustules or sinuses with granules at this stage. She did not have fever, loss of appetite or loss of weight and denied of previous traumatic injury to the affected site.\\nBasic investigations, X ray, ESR and full blood count, were within normal range. Her symptoms did not improve with the initial management with analgesics and she was further evaluated radiologically with the clinical suspicion of malignancy of bone or soft tissue. The MRI findings of the left ankle showed multiple linear and rounded lesions in the left calcaneous. The lesions showed a contrast enhancing center with a hypointense rim. There was hypointense dot noted at the centre of the lesion in T2 weighted image giving rise to \"dot in circle sign\" (Fig. 1: MRI of the left ankle showing \"dot in circle sign\"). Cortical erosions noted in the superior, posterior and the lateral aspect of the calcaneous. There was no sinus tract to the skin. The rest of the tarsal bone and distal tibia and fibula were normal. All the above radiological features were suggestive for maduromycosis of the foot.\\nWith the radiological supportive evidence of maduromycosis, a punch biopsy of the skin was obtained and sent for mycological evaluation. Although both direct smear and culture were negative, she was started with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily and cotrimoxazole. It appeared to be responding and she was informed to continue the antimicrobials further. However, after about 4 months, she noted reappearing of throbbing pain and few pustular lesions over the affected area. These pustules subsequently ruptured and secreted clear fluid containing black dots. With the new clinical picture, a repeat biopsy was obtained for fungal studies. The direct smear of the biopsy with 10 % KOH revealed septate fungal filaments.\\nAfter 2 weeks, a scanty growth of filamentous fungi was seen in the Sabouraud Dextrose agar incubated in 26  C and 37  C. The obverse view of the colony was yellowish brown with wooly consistency. Reddish brown pigment was diffusing in to the medium. The lactophenol cotton blue mount of the growth revealed sterile dense melanized mycelia. No sporulation was noted. The slide culture also showed sterile mycelium. Based on above characteristics the diagnosis of M. mycetomatis was made.\\nOral itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) and terbinafine (250 mg daily) were started and continued for 7 months while monitoring liver functions. Her symptoms subsided gradually so that itraconazole dose was reduced up to 100 mg twice daily. After 16 months from the starting therapy, she was free from pain, swelling and discharging sinuses and she is being followed up at the clinic.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 15-year-old Argentinian Warmblood gelding was referred for treatment of a long-standing penile lesion affected by myiasis.\\nAt referral the main complaint was a florid, cauliflower-like ulcerated mass, measuring 10 cm in diameter that enclosed the glans penis together with penile urethra (Figure 1) with malodorous purulent and blood-stained discharge together with areas of necrosis. The mass was infested by muscae spp. larvae. Poor body condition score (BCS 4/9) and strangury were also present.\\nOnce penis prolapse was obtained by intravenous administration with acepromazine 30 mug/kg, palpation of the penis revealed a diffuse thickening of the penile shaft with multiple ulcerations involving the inner and outer laminae of the preputial fold. Due to the regional anatomical alterations related to the mass (phlegmon and oedema), inguinal lymph nodes were not palpable. For the same reason ultrasonographic examination of external genitalia and regional lymph nodes was not conclusive. Transrectal examination was unremarkable.\\nUrine analysis revealed the presence of leukocytes and nitrites, consistent with urinary tract inflammation. As the clinical condition of the horse and the primary lesion were severe, suggesting complete excision in any case, fine needle aspiration or excisional biopsies were not attempted; therefore surgical removal was combined with harvesting material for histopathological examination.\\nBased on clinical findings differential diagnoses were SCC of the penis and prepuce and/or habronemiasis. Due to the infiltrating pattern and the diffusion of the disorder and to the presence of multiple nonhealing lesions, leading, respectively, to difficulty at micturition and local infection, an en bloc resection of the penis and prepuce was decided; the eventuality of a penile retroversion or a permanent perineal urethrostomy was considered according to the intraoperatory findings and the degree of infiltration of the penis body. Systemic NSAIDS (flunixin meglumine, 1.1. mg/kg i.v. q24 h) and antibiotic (sulfadiazine-trimethoprim, 30 kg/kg p.o. q24 h) therapies were initiated before surgery.\\nSurgery was performed under general anaesthesia with isoflurane with the horse in dorsal recumbence. For the en bloc resection, a fusiform 40 cm long skin incision starting at the umbilicus was made along the midline. It extended caudally encircling the preputial orifice. Blunt dissection of subcutaneous tissue was performed around the penis until the abdominal fascia was reached and the body of the penis was released from its anatomic and vascular connections. Haemorrhage was controlled with electrocauterization and ligation of the major vessels (dorsal penis arteries and veins). The dissection plane was extended to both the external inguinal rings and the external pudendal arteries and vein were ligated. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes appeared enlarged and therefore were excised. At palpation the penile body was extensively thickened suggesting amputation as proximal as possible: so penile retroversion was excluded and perineal urethrostomy was performed. To this aim, a tourniquet was applied proximally to the shaft of the penis and an extensive resection was performed close to the ischiatic arch, dividing the suspensory ligament of penis. The proximal stump showed a normal macroscopic appearance and was sutured with double transfixing sutures (2 USP absorbable multifilament) placed through the penile body in a dorsoventral direction, to obtain adequate haemostasis. Once urethral lumen was clearly visible a urinary catheter was placed. The outer perimeter of the tunica albuginea was apposed in a simple interrupted pattern with a 2/0 USP monofilament absorbable suture.\\nFor permanent urethrostomy a 8 cm skin incision was created on the perineal raphe starting about 7-8 cm below the anus, ending at the level of the ischiatic arch. Blunt dissection of subcutis, penis retractor muscles, and bulbospongiosus muscles was achieved until the urethra was visualized. The penis retractor muscles were sutured to the subcutis in a simple continuous pattern, using a 0 USP monofilament absorbable material. Then the urethral wall was incised longitudinally for about 6 cm and the mucosa sutured to the skin in a simple interrupted pattern with a 2/0 USP monofilament nonabsorbable material.\\nThe subcutis of the abdominal wound was sutured with a 0 USP monofilament absorbable suture material in a simple continuous pattern and the skin was sutured with metallic staples. A multitubular drain was applied laterally to the midline to the abdominal wall suture at the scrotal region (Figure 2).\\nAfter recovery from anaesthesia the horse showed a moderate haemorrhage from the urethrostomy, which was particularly evident at the end of urination, leading after 48 h to a marked reduction of PCV (15%) and TP (4,5 g/dL). As the haemorrhage seemed to come from the corpus spongiosum penis and surgical haemostasis was not feasible, it was successfully managed by the administration of tranexamic acid (15 mg/kg i.v. q12 h) for 2 days. Oral support with vitamin B complex and folic and pantothenic acid was given for 10 days until PCV and TP reached, respectively, 30% and 6.8 g/dL.\\nStrangury but not pollakiuria was observed 3 days after surgery.\\nThree days after surgery, the horse showed a serosanguineous collection above the abdominal wound and a moderate purulent discharge from the skin incision that were managed with daily manual massage and local disinfection. Five days after surgery, the urinary catheter and the multitubular drain were removed without complications.\\nOn day 12 standing surgical revision of the urethrostomy was required to remove some necrotic urethral mucosa leading to a partial dehiscence of the wound.\\nHistopathology of the lesions confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of SCC of the penis and prepuce invading the subcutaneous tissue, not the albuginea. Lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltration of the corpus cavernosum suggested chronic balanitis; moderate subcutaneous eosinophilic infiltration was also detected but no evidence of Habronema spp. infestation was found. The margins of the excised tissues were free of neoplastic cells, and the regional lymph nodes were inflamed but not affected by the neoplastic process.\\nAfter skin staples removal 14 days after surgery, the horse was discharged. Urination was unremarkable from the perineal stoma. No urine scalding or subcutaneous infiltration could be observed. PCV and TP values were back to preoperatory values.\\nA clinical follow-up performed 2 months after surgery revealed reduction of the urethrostomy to a diameter of about 1.5/2 cm. Anyhow urination was unaffected with a mare attitude and no urine scalding was detected.\\nA 3-year follow-up showed no recurrence of the neoplasm with normal urination. Urethrostomy did not show any further stricture as well as no urine scalding (Figure 3).',\n",

Her gait was abnormal, secondary to the severe scoliosis.\\nShe was started on therapeutic enoxaparin, with the dose being adjusted on the basis of the antifactor Xa levels (goal of 0.5-1.0). Her syncope was attributed to the significant lymphedema and venous varicosities in the lower extremities, along with the consumption of very high-glucose containing fluids (juice and pop) resulting in osmotic diuresis. She also had an ECHO done which demonstrated low left ventricular function. Her compliance as an outpatient for taking heparin and antibiotics was poor. The decision was made, therefore, to keep her as an inpatient until delivery from about 24 weeks, which greatly improved her nutrition and compliance, as all medications were given under nursing supervision.\\nShe was seen by psychiatry and social work while in the hospital. She was counselled by prenatal genetics but declined testing for herself or on her newborn.\\nAn MRI of the abdomen and pelvis performed revealed marked hemihypertrophy of the subcutaneous soft tissues on the right side at the level of the lower abdomen (Figure 2(a)); pelvis and buttock and thigh region (Figure 2(b)), which contain innumerable venous vascular malformations and varicosities. No increase in vascularity was noted in perineal or uterine area. These changes were consistent with KTW syndrome.\\nThe MRI of the spine revealed marked levoconvex scoliosis with a marked leftward pelvic tilt. A developmentally narrow spinal canal was noted. Numerous venous channels were noted to cross at the potential epidural injection sites from L1 to L5. The thickness from the skin to the thecal space was 9.4 cm (Figure 2(c)). No intracranial or intraspinal vascular malformations were noted. Once the MRI was completed, anesthesiology was consulted. Their recommendation was for extreme caution for neuroaxial anesthesia and if to be given to be performed above the level of L1. Given the increased risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), several units of blood were to be cross-matched with two large bore intravenous access. Consideration for the use of cell-saver and the availability of a Trauma Pak if bleeding was a concern was proposed.\\nSerial scans on the fetus demonstrated as decrease in growth and along with a persistent breech presentation. A decision was made for an elective caesarian section at 37+3 weeks, given the intrauterine growth restriction with abnormal Doppler in a breech presentation. A multidisciplinary discussion between general surgery, neonatology, anesthesia, internal medicine, and nursing was arranged.\\nEnoxaparin was discontinued 24 hours prior to the elected time of the C-section. Four units of packed red blood cells had been placed in the OR in the event that there was a need to transfuse the patient. General anesthesia under fiber optic visualization was administrated. A midline vertical incision was made. Extensive varicosities were then found in the subcutaneous tissues closer to the level of the pelvis, which were ligated. The incision was extended superiorly to be away from the varicosities. The uterus was found to be bicornuate, which explained the breech presentation of the fetus. The neonate was at the 10th %ile for growth. No obvious stigmata of KTW syndrome were noted at the time of birth.',\n",

Biopsy was performed and final pathology reported a heavily pigmented malignant melanoma involving the nasal mucosa, positive for S100 protein. Maxillofacial CT scan without contrast showed an abnormal soft tissue density in the left nasal cavity extending into the proximal upper left maxillary sinus and obstructing the left ostiomeatal complex. On metastatic workup, PET/CT revealed an FDG-avid right middle lobe lung nodule. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule. Pathology reported typical carcinoid, a finding managed separately and irrelevant to this discussion. After negative metastatic workup, the patient underwent mapping biopsies and nasal/sinus endoscopic tumor debulking. During resection, the tumor was found to extend along the nasal floor from the inferior meatus to the level of the inferior nasal septum, with pigmented mucosal changes involving the lateral aspect of the nasal vestibule, the superior aspect of the nasal septum extending onto the skull base, and the area of attachment of the middle turbinate. Pathology of the fragmented resection specimen confirmed SNMM. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry returned as high expression, intensity 3+, and tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 50%. The consensus recommendation at the multidisciplinary tumor board was to initiate ImT (nivolumab) and RT, to be followed by ImT (nivolumab) alone. The patient received nivolumab monotherapy (480 mg on a q4 week schedule) with concurrent intensity modulated (IM) RT to a total dose of 60 Gy in 20 fractions targeting the left nasal cavity. The patient tolerated ImT/RT well and went on to receive three cycles of adjuvant nivolumab as scheduled. However, nasal endoscopy and interval MRI identified local disease progression. Anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) was added to the ImT regimen with a plan for four cycles. After Cycle 1, the patient developed elevated liver enzymes (AST 289 U/L, ALT 301 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 156 U/L), attributed to ImT-induced autoimmune hepatitis. ImT was discontinued and the patient was treated with intravenous solumedrol 150 mg followed by an extended course of prednisone (total duration, 30 days). Interval PET/CT showed no evidence of metastatic disease and the patient was followed closely in the clinic with radiographic surveillance. A repeat maxillofacial CT showed an increase in the size of the nodular enhancing soft tissue mass in the left posterior nasal cavity, and CT abdomen with contrast revealed a new 3.3-cm hypoenhancing liver lesion in segment 5, consistent with metastasis. CT biopsy of the liver lesion confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma. PET/CT showed rapid progression of numerous metastatic lesions within liver segments 2, 5, and 8, with the segment 5 lesion growing from 3 to 10 cm over 2 months. PET/CT also identified new FDG-avid lesions in thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae (T9, T12, L3, and S1) highly suspicious for spinal metastases.\\nAfter progression through two courses of ImT, the patient was presented again at tumor board and recommended to restart ImT with Opdualag (dual anti-PD-1 nivolumab combined with anti-LAG-3 relatlimab), and was referred to radiation oncology for concurrent stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SBRT) of the dominant hepatic lesion. The patient received the first cycle of Opdualag with a concomitant course of SBRT, delivering 50 Gy in five fractions to the segment 5 liver tumor. SBRT was performed on a hybrid magnetic resonance/linear accelerator (MR/Linac) platform using MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (MRgOART) ( Figure 2  ). \\nAfter the second cycle of Opdualag, the patient developed severe keratoconjunctivitis with corneal ulcerations. The patient had a history of ImT-induced hepatitis, and systemic therapy was discontinued out of concern for another severe ImT-related adverse event (irAE). Interval PET/CT 3 months after SBRT showed a CMR with no suspicious hypermetabolic activity within the surgical cavity and complete resolution of all FDG-avid lesions in the liver (including unirradiated ones) and axial spine where hypermetabolism had previously been identified ( Figure 3 ).\\nCT chest, abdomen, and pelvis 3 months after SBRT demonstrated a decrease in the size of all liver lesions, with the segment 5 lesion measuring 2 cm in maximum diameter down from 10 cm. Six months after SBRT, the patient's treatment response persisted despite discontinuation of all therapy for 4 months.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 50-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of a duodenal tumor. She had a 13-year history of left nephrectomy for RCC. The histologic diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma of grade 2, pT2N0M0, and pStage II (according to the current TNM staging of the Union for International Cancer Control, 7th edition). The postoperative course was uneventful, and no adjuvant therapy was administered.\\nThree years after nephrectomy, the patient underwent external beam radiation therapy (a total of 46 Gy) for a solitary metastatic bone tumor in the seventh thoracic vertebra. A further 7 years later, a solitary metastatic tumor was detected in the tail of the pancreas, and resection of the pancreatic tail and spleen was performed. Since the histologic findings of the pancreatic tumor were similar to those of the kidney, metachronous metastasis of RCC to the tail of the pancreas was assumed. A further 3 years after resection of the pancreatic tail, severe anemia was detected during a regular examination. The patient mentioned the presence of persistent tarry stools for 3-4 weeks. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and revealed a mass in the descending portion of the duodenum.\\nThe patient was admitted to our hospital and underwent detailed examinations. Her hemoglobin level was 7.5 g/dl. A subsequent EGD revealed an ulcerated polypoid mass in the descending portion of the duodenum; the mass was adjacent to the oral side, but did not involve the papilla of Vater (fig. 1a). Endoscopic ultrasonography showed the tumor to be partially invading the head of the pancreas (fig. 1b). Duodenography revealed a protruding lesion at the wall of the pancreatic side of the descending portion of the duodenum (fig. 1c). Abdominal enhanced computed tomography depicted a well-contrasted, hypervascular mass (fig. 1d). Magnifying endoscopy showed a diminished mucosal surface pattern of the gastrointestinal epithelium across the surface of the tumor (fig. 1e). Furthermore, combined with narrow-band imaging (NBI), it also showed a highly dense assembly of microvessels on the surface of the tumor that did not form a capillary network pattern (fig. 1f). A duodenal biopsy was performed, and the histopathologic diagnosis was inflammatory granulation with no malignancy. An additional duodenal biopsy for histologic confirmation was not performed to avoid uncontrollable duodenal bleeding from the biopsy site. Although partial resection of the pancreas had already been performed for a metastatic tumor of the pancreatic tail, the remnant pancreas was of rich volume (fig. 1d). There was no evidence of metastasis to the lung, liver, lymph nodes or other organs. Enterography showed no abnormal findings suggestive of metastasis to the small intestine. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography showed specific FDG uptake in the duodenal tumor (standardized uptake value [SUVmax] 6.1). No abnormally enhanced lesions were identified in the body. The levels of both carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were within normal ranges. Resultantly, our diagnosis was metachronous, solitary duodenal metastasis derived from RCC, and we therefore performed a pancreaticoduodenectomy.\\nThere were no findings of malignant ascites, carcinomatosis, omental implants or distant metastases to other abdominal organs; we therefore subsequently performed a subtotal, stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, choledochojejunostomy, pancreaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy with preservation of the left gastric artery and vein to maintain the supply and drainage blood flow to the stomach after splenectomy. The pancreas was dissected just above the portal vein. Regional lymph node dissection was minimized.\\nMacroscopic findings of the resected specimen indicated that the polypoid mass at the descending portion of the duodenum was ulcerative and friable (fig. 2a). Histologic findings revealed that the surface of the tumor was coated by granulation tissue consisting of inflammatory cells, fibrosis and edematous stroma (fig. 2b). Furthermore, the cancerous lesion comprised clear cells containing glycogen that were arranged in an alveolar pattern (fig. 2c). The tumor had invaded the duodenal muscle and partially invaded the pancreas at a depth of 2 mm. Although the tumor was located very close to the lower common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, histologic direct invasion was not observed in either duct. Immunohistology showed that the tumor cells were positive for vimentin and CD10 and negative for CK7 (fig. 2d-f). The histologic diagnosis was metastatic RCC.\\nThe patient experienced postoperative leakage from the gastrojejunostomy. After percutaneous drainage of the intra-abdominal abscess, she recovered and was discharged on postoperative day 59. One year after surgery, the patient maintained a good glucose tolerance and received only oral hypoglycemic agents and no insulin therapy.

The patient had discontinued cholesterol-lowering medication. The patient's blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were normal. Total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein were 7.1 and 5.5 mmol/L, respectively. Due to the uncharacteristic nature of the patient's symptoms, a CCTA was performed. The calcium score was 140 and CCTA revealed calcified and noncalcified coronary atherosclerosis with a mixed, stenotic plaque in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) [Figure 1]. Functional testing was scheduled with a rest-stress Rubidium-82 myocardial perfusion scan. Myocardial perfusion and coronary flow reserve were normal during adequate stress response to adenosine (140 mug/kg/min) [Figure 2]. Atorvastatin was prescribed and the patient continued his high level of daily physical activity.\\nOne year later, following strenuous running, the patient sustained a cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started immediately with successful electrical cardioversion of ventricular fibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation 6 min after the alarm. The electrocardiogram showed ST-elevation [Figure 3]. Acute invasive angiography revealed occlusion of the mid-LAD. Normal coronary flow was restored after recanalization and stenting [Figure 4]. Ten days later, transthoracic echocardiography showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 40-45% with apical hypokinesis. The patient was advised cardiac rehabilitation.\\nAs a blind study, we submitted the patient's CCTA data, which had been obtained one year earlier and had revealed a highly significant ischemia-producing lesion in the mid-LAD, for FFRCT analysis [Figure 5]. FFRCT analysis was performed at HeartFlow (Redwood City, CA, USA) utilizing updated proprietary software. Computation of noninvasive FFRCT from CCTA image data requires a physiologic model of coronary blood flow. The physiologic model is based on three underlying principles as described in detail by Taylor et al.,: (i) The total resting coronary blood flow can be quantified relative to the myocardial mass, (ii) The microcirculatory vascular resistance at rest is inversely proportional to the size of the coronary arteries supplying the myocardium, and (iii) The vasodilatory response of the coronary microcirculation to adenosine infusion can be predicted, allowing computational modeling of the maximal hyperemic state. The integration of the model of coronary physiology to 3-dimensional computational models allows computation of coronary flow and pressure at each point in the coronary arteries under hyperemic conditions.\",\n",

Haultain's procedure was planned. Foley's catheterization was done. With all standard precautions, the abdomen was opened in layers. A cup-like depression was noted in the midpelvic cavity, and bilateral round ligaments, fallopian tubes, and ovarian ligaments were coming out of the cup-like depression (Figure 2).

A ten-day course of moxifloxacin was prescribed for treatment of pneumonia.\\nAt follow up 10 days later, her cough did not improve. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 6 cm mass-like area of consolidation with small cavities in the right middle lobe, and well defined solid nodules in the periphery of the left lower lobe (Fig. 1).\\nThe differential diagnosis for the CT findings included an atypical pneumonia, possibly fungal in origin, malignancy, septic emboli, or vasculitis.\\nSerologies for Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis were negative. Blood cultures grew Propionobacterium acnes but only in a single culture bottle. Anti-cytoplasmic nuclear antibodies were positive with c-ANCA at a concentration of 8 AI units.\\nThe patient, still clinically stable, was admitted to hospital for further investigation of suspected ANCA-associated vasculitis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated at 58 mm/hr and 18.3 mg/L, respectively. Anti-nuclear antibodies and extractable nuclear antigens were negative. Complement assays were normal and anti-PR3 antibodies were high, measuring 417 chemiluminescent units. Fluoroscopically guided percutaneous fine and core needle biopsies were obtained from the right middle lobe mass.\\nThe core needle biopsies showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. The granulomas consisted mainly of giant cells and epithelioid histiocytes surrounding areas of suppurative basophilic necrosis and embedded in a polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate. The elastic stain demonstrated areas of vasculitis with fragmentation of the elastic layer. The special stains as well as tissue cultures for fungi and mycobacteria were negative. This constellation of features was diagnostic of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Fig. 2).\\nFollowing a negative tuberculin skin test and normal hepatitis serology, she was started on high dose prednisone (1 mg/kg), and Methotrexate (15 mg/week). Within 4 weeks her cough and malaise improved. Further investigation with bloodwork, urinalysis, and nasal examination showed no evidence of multi- organ involvement. On repeat chest radiograph four weeks after treatment, there was interval improvement in the airspace disease density (Fig. 3).',\n",

Clinical examination revealed decreased muscle strength in all extremities associated with hypotonia and areflexia.\\nA diagnosis of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was considered and a lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal white blood cell count in CSF) suggestive of GBS. She was started on intravenous immunoglobulin G, but within 48 hours, she progressed to complete flaccid quadriparesis with involvement of respiratory muscles and required mechanical ventilatory support.\\nOn day 12, a cardiac electrophysiology consultation was requested for bradycardia and multiple episodes of asystole. These episodes occurred spontaneously, unrelated to tracheobronchial suctioning, blood drawing or any other intervention. The longest observed pause was 12 seconds. Electrolyte profile was normal and oxygenation was satisfactory. The result of her 12-lead ECG is shown in Figure 1.\\nIn view of the multiple episodes of bradycardia and asystole the decision was made to insert a pacemaker. The patient initially received a temporary pacemaker. However, due to an anticipated prolonged clinical course and the potential for recurrent bradycardia and asystole, an INSIGNIA Ultra DR dual chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted after 5 days. The pacemaker was initially programmed to VVI mode at 40 beats per minute to prevent pacing as much as possible. The pacemaker mode was switched to DDDR at the time of discharge because of lack of spontaneous sinus node activity. A paced rhythm was present 18 days post implant, suggesting occurrence of intermittent bradycardia.\\nThe patient returned to our office for a routine pacemaker check 3 months after implantation. The pacemaker check revealed that she was in paced rhythm for most of the time in this period. Seventy percent was atrial paced ventricular sensed rhythm with a set lower rate of 40 beats per min. Twenty percent was atrial paced ventricular paced rhythm with a set AV delay of 220 msec. Only for ten percent of the time was she in atrial sensed ventricular sensed rhythm. This may indicate prolonged influence on the autonomic tone even after complete somatic recovery and likely justifies the need for a permanent pacemaker. As far as choice of pacemaker mode is concerned, our patient received a DDDR mode. However, as the 3 month follow up interrogation showed ventricular pacing of <40%, a Managed Ventricular Pacing or the AAIsafeR would have also been a good pacemaker mode option in retrospect.',\n",

Sonography revealed a large lesion (11 cm) in the right liver lobe which was more than 75% necrotic but also 8 additional lesions up to 5 cm (Figure 3).\\nAfter obtaining informed consent, therapy with panobinostat was started in November 2009: sorafenib was continued at 800 mg daily and panobinostat at 20 mg was administered orally on days 1 and 4 for two consecutive weeks followed by one week of sorafenib therapy alone, representing a three week therapy cycle which was repeated 5 times.\\nStaging was performed after three cycles in January 2010 (Figure 4). Here, contrast enhanced sonography showed constant lesions in liver segments V, VI and VII (94*80*75 mm) as well as in segment II (29*32 mm) with signs of cirrhosis but no ascites. MRI scanning showed slightly decreasing hemorrhagic lesions with signs of liquid transformation in both liver lobes and of the soft tissue metastasis in the autochthonic spine musculature. No new lesions were discovered. The patient reported diarrhea, exsiccosis, hypocalcaemia and nausea during the last cycle that responded to supportive treatment.\\nAfter eight cycles of sorafenib and panobinostat, MRI staging in April 2010 showed a further regression of the lesions in the liver and the spine musculature. Contrast sonography showed a necrotic lesion in segment VI and a hypervascularized but still constant lesion on segment VIII.\\nBy request of the patient the therapy with panobinostat was stopped in May 2010 as the patient experienced lack of appetite and slight weight loss (3 kg since February 2010), which was perceived as increasingly wearing by the patient and lead to withdrawal of consent. Sorafenib was further continued at the standard dose.\\nAlthough transaminases and gamma-GT were initially elevated (maximum GOT 130 U/l, GPT 178 U/l, gamma-GT 167 U/l), these parameters rapidly normalized under sorafenib therapy and stayed in the normal range until the end of treatment with panobinostat (Figure 5A). Albumin and prothrombin time as markers of liver synthesis capacity were slightly decreased throughout the treatment period without signs of clinical symptoms. Interestingly, the initially elevated tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) returned to normal values already under sorafenib therapy despite a lack of radiologic response at this stage (Figure 5B). AFP levels remained below 10 ng/ml until the end of the panobinostat treatment period, too, but raised to 36.6 ng/ml at the end of the observation period. This increase in AFP was also paralleled by an increase in transaminases and gamma-GT at this stage indicating a deterioration of liver function and progress of the tumor disease under sorafenib monotherapy. Hematologic assessment revealed leucopenia, low hemoglobin, erythrocytes and hematocrit under initial sorafenib therapy. These values remained stable also under additional panobinostat therapy with even an amelioration of leucopenia to normal range after three cycles. Differential blood count showed a stably lymphopenia and monocytosis during the whole treatment period. All other laboratory parameters remained in the normal range throughout the study period.',\n",

His vital signs were: blood pressure, 156/87 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 19 breaths/minute; heart rate, 132 beats/minute; and temperature within normal limits. Oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. The abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen that was severely tender to palpation. Intravenous (IV) fluids were immediately started for the patient.

The results of general physical examination were unremarkable. She was suspected of having retrobulbar optic neuritis and was hospitalized immediately. However, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 9 mm heterogeneous intracranial lesion attached to the TS around the left optic nerve anterior to the chiasm (Figure 1A-C). Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed an increase of the cell counts (171/mL mononuclear cells 162, polynuclear cells 9, normal range: <45/mL) and protein concentration (61 mg/dL, normal range: 10-40 mg/dL). These findings led to a tentative diagnosis of granulomatous inflammation with optic nerve compression. She was treated with steroid pulse therapy, and then referred to the ophthalmologic department for neuro-ophthalmic examinations on March 11, 2010.\\nHer best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye, and she had a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The results of ophthalmoscopic examinations were normal (Figure 2A and B). Static perimetry 30-2 with the Humphrey field analyzer (HFAII 745; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) showed an inferior temporal field defect in the left eye (Figure 2C and D). The pattern VEPs elicited by transient and steadystate stimuli to the left eye were undetectable (Figure 3). She was diagnosed with optic nerve compression. Three weeks after the steroid pulse treatment, her BCVA improved to 1.2, and the field defect disappeared. At the 1-year follow-up examination, her BCVA remained in 1.2, and the visual field was almost normal in the left eye without any treatment (Figure 2E). A thinning of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) was detected by a spectral domain OCT (Figure 4).\\nOn July 23, 2011, she began suffering from headaches again, and she noted a complete loss of vision in her left eye. She was immediately referred to the neurosurgical department. She was treated with steroid pulse therapy again, but there was no improvement. The visual acuity remained at no light perception and there was no direct light reflex in the left eye. Thin sliced enhanced MRI revealed that the intracranial lesion had extended into her left optic canal, even though the size of the main mass was almost the same as earlier (Figure 1D-F). Emergency surgery was carried out on July 29, 2011. A hemi-interhemispheric approach was used, and the tumor was successfully removed (Simpson grade 2) including the intracranial lesion by opening the optic canal (Figure 1G-I). A diagnosis of meningothelial meningioma was made by histopathological examination of the removed tissue.\\nOne month after surgery, her BCVA improved to 1.2, and a mild temporal hemianopia was detected in the left eye (Figure 2F). The pattern VEPs were present but had a prolonged P100 latency of 170 ms (Figure 3). OCT showed that the GCC was thinner than the preoperative thickness (Figure 4).

The tumor diameter was 52.85 mm (mediastinal window images were uniformly used for measurement and comparison) with atelectasis ( Figure 1A ). Histological examination of a transbronchial specimen confirmed that the tumor was a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). No lymph node metastases or distant organ metastases were identified.

Paclitaxel (albumin-bound) 400 mg D1 combined with carboplatin 500 mg D1 on a 21-day cycle was used for induction chemotherapy. The first treatment cycle began on October 16, 2020, and the two-cycle efficacy was evaluated as stable disease (  Figure 1B  ).\\nAt the end of the first round of chemotherapy, the patient again presented with cough with hemoptysis in the early morning of the 3rd day; the blood was dark red and of approximately 10-15 ml. Routine blood test revealed that the bleeding was not caused by thrombocytopenia, a common adverse reaction to chemotherapy. Bronchial artery embolization was performed twice during chemotherapy to address the symptoms. The first embolization was performed on October 19, 2020. The interventional doctor injected the contrast medium into the thickened artery: the trunk of the right middle and lower lobe bronchial artery; this helped to clearly stain the tumor, and the staining disappeared after poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) microspheres measuring 300-500 mm in diameter was injected into the arteries. However, the results were unsatisfactory, and the patient's hemoptysis did not reduce in intensity following the procedure. A second embolization was performed 6 weeks later (December 2, 2020). The PVA microspheres with a diameter of 100-300mm and two coils with diameter 2cm/crimp diameter 2cm (2-2) were injected into the right upper lobe bronchial artery; and four coils with diameter 2cm/crimp diameter 2cm (2-2) were injected into the right middle lobe bronchial artery. The patient's hemoptysis disappeared; no chemotherapeutic drugs were used in either procedure. The patient tolerated the intervention, and there were no adverse reactions, such as fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. On the second day after embolization, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was initiated at a dose of 60 Gy for 30 fractions. On December 9, 2020, enhanced CT performed during radiotherapy to reposition the patient revealed that the tumor had significantly reduced in size to 21.16 mm (  Figure 1C  ). On December 16, 2020, after the 10th radiotherapy fractionation, an enhanced CT scan revealed that the tumor had reduced to 18.11 mm in size. It remained this size for 4 months (  Figure 1D  ). Unfortunately, the patient has since developed lymph node metastases (occurred 3 months after radiotherapy) and remains under treatment. The patient provided informed consent for publication of this case report.\",\n",

The first type of seizure was tonic axial seizures characterized by flexion of the neck and body and the extension of four extremities for several seconds. The tonic seizures could last several seconds. This type of seizure occurred predominantly at night and the frequency was about 4-5 times per week. The second type was atypical absence seizures, which manifested as a sudden loss of consciousness and the resuming of normal activity right after the seizure. This type of seizure could last about 15 s and the frequency was 4-5 times per week. The third type was the myoclonic seizure, presented as prominent myoclonic jerks of bilateral upper limbs. The frequency of this type of seizures was 2-3 times per day. The last type of seizure was the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which could last about 5 min. The mean frequency of this type of seizure was <1 time per week.\\nThe patient was a full-term infant with no history of perinatal asphyxia, head injury, encephalitis, and febrile convulsions. His family history was unremarkable. He had a mild degree of intellectual impairment and learning disability after the onset of the disease. The physical examinations were normal. Auxiliary examinations, including blood routine examination, serum biochemical examination, thyroid function, autoimmunity antibody, and blood ammonia, were normal. The electrocardiogram was normal and the QT interval (QTc) was 372 ms. There was no lesion on the brain MRI. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale showed a borderline cognition impairment. The electroencephalogram (EEG) before treatment showed that there was a large number of 3 to 5 Hz slow waves with middle and high amplitude in the anterior region in the background. Fast rhythms bursts of 16 to 20 Hz and multiple-spike-and-slow-waves of 0.5 to 1 Hz were observed during the sleep period. Slow spike-and-slow-waves of 1.5 to 2.5 Hz were observed during awake time (Figure 1).\\nThe patient was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome after considering his multiple types of epileptic seizures, mental retardation, and typical electroencephalographic features. He was refractory to a multiple anti-epileptic drugs treatment, including sodium valproate (8 mg/kg/day), levetiracetam (50 mg/kg/day), clonazepam (0.0375 mg/kg/day), topiramate (3.75 mg/kg/day), and lamotrigine (2.5 mg/kg/day). Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel heterozygous KCNT1 mutation (chr9:138649026; c.625C>T; p.Arg209Cys) inherited from his father. This missense mutation was highly likely to cause the dysfunction of the KCNT1 channel and led to a gain-of-function phenotype. This alteration had not been previously reported and was not found in the ExAC database (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/), and was predicted to be likely pathogenic.\\nThis study was approved by the human research ethic committees of Xuanwu hospital capital medical university. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and guardians of minors for the quinidine therapy and the publication of this study. Additive quinidine therapy to our patient was initiated at 12 years of age. The doses of the above anticonvulsants remained unchanged. In the month before quinidine therapy, the patient had 16 tonic seizures, 12 atypical absence seizures, 10 myoclonic seizures, and 1 generalized tonic-clonic seizures.\\nAfter admission, the quinidine therapy was initiated with 5 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses under electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. The QTc ranged from 361 to 415 ms, with an average of 378 ms (the normal limit of QTc is within 450 ms). After 1 month of treatment, the dose of quinidine was titrated to 10 mg/kg/day and he had 13 tonic seizures during this month. The dose was maintained during the following 2 months. QTc was in normal range (391-436 ms). There was also no other adverse effect of quinidine. At the fourth month, the dose of quinidine was increased to 13.75 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses. The frequency of tonic seizures ranged between 4 and 6 times per month. The mean QTc interval was 383 ms. As no adverse effects were experienced, the dose of quinidine was maintained to 13.75 mg/kg/day during the following 4 months. The patient had 4 tonic seizures per month. The frequency of tonic seizures subsided by 75% (Figure 2A), whereas the frequency of the other types of seizures was not reduced significantly.\\nVideo EEG (VEEG) was performed regularly during treatment and the number of epileptic discharges was counted by four expert technicians who had not seen the patient's clinical information. One slow spike-and-wave complex or one episode of paroxysmal fast rhythms in EEGs were counted as one epileptiform discharge. 1323 epileptiform discharges were recorded during a 24-h video EEG before the treatment of quinidine. We subsequently applied the 24-h VEEG every 3 months to evaluated the efficacy of the quinidine treatment. The total number of epileptic discharges was 512, 652, and 598 in the next 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively. The epileptiform discharges decreased by 54.80% (Figure 2B).\",\n",

In the right total, 3.5x2-cm thyroidectomy material section, a 1.7x1.2-cm nodule, including necrotic and focal hyalinized areas, located 0.3 cm from the thyroid capsule, was observed. The frozen section analysis was reported as \"necrosis, focal papillary structures in some places around the hyalinized areas, malignant-benign differentiation was not clear, and paraffin sections were to be examined,\" and a total thyroidectomy was prevented.\\nIn the center of the paraffin sections, papillary structures composed of large oncocytic cytoplasmic thyrocytes in the focal area around intense infarct were noticed (Figs. 1, 2, 3).\\nThese papillary structures were observed in the focal areas, and because of the previous FNA diagnosis of follicular neoplasia, these structures were initially considered to be \"reactive papillary hyperplasia.\" However, when examined in detail, these papillary structures were found to be infiltrative in places in spite of being in a focal area, and their cytological evaluation suggested papillary carcinoma.\\nImmunohistochemical analysis of the papillary structures showed diffuse, strong positivity with cytokeratin 19 and focal, weak positivity with HBME-1, whereas the external control was positive with galectin-3 and no staining was observed in the case (Figs. 4, 5, 6).\\nOn this basis, BRAF V600E was studied in terms of molecular genetics, and the patient was diagnosed with a \"thyroid papillary carcinoma\" because of a positive result.\\nFNA preparations of the patient that had been previously analyzed in the external center were made available for a re-evaluation to determine the extent to which the cytology would contribute in such cases, and FNA preparations were re-evaluated.\\nCytological evaluation revealed focal groove structures with large oncocytic cytoplasm in hypercellular spreads, mostly in a microfollicular pattern; some of the structures were standing alone or in groups similar to focal papillary structures, overlapping in places, and also showed thyrocytes with intranuclear inclusion (Fig. 7).\\nIt was considered that an underdiagnosis was made in the FNA analysis, and it could be evaluated as at least category V (suspicious for malignancy) or category VI (malign aspirate).\\nThe patient presented to our hospital again with a complaint of dizziness and nausea after thyroidectomy.

Maternal history was significant for three prior miscarriages. There were no teratogen exposures during pregnancy. He was healthy with the exception of severe constipation as an infant. He had global developmental delays. He sat at 6 months, walked independently at 24 months, and was unable to ride a bike. He also had fine motor difficulties, particularly with writing letters and using utensils. From a language perspective, he was nonverbal and had deficits in receptive speech. His fourteen-year old brother had a genetic microarray confirming duplication of exons 3 and 4 MECP2 and triplication of exons 1 and 2 MECP2 and also had global developmental delay, absence of speech, and hypotonia. His younger brother and proband also had a duplication of MECP2 on testing. The patient's maternal grandmother had seizures and there was a history of epilepsy and cognitive impairment in other maternal relatives.\\nThe patient presented with multiple dysmorphic features, including epicanthal folds, small palpebral fissures, long face, simplified helices, clinodactyly, small hands with poor capillary perfusion, and inverted nipples. He had mild scoliosis and kyphosis. His cranial nerve and motor exam were grossly normal. Reflexes were within normal limits. Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. He had a normal echocardiogram.\\nThe patient presented with a history of seizures suggestive of focal dyscognitive seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The initial episodes were characterized by unresponsiveness, focal eye deviation, and post-ictal confusion with an unknown seizure frequency. He also developed tonic-clonic episodes involving his four extremities. Later, he mainly had episodes of drop seizures, occurring 20-30 times daily and lasting minutes. As a result of these drop seizures, he lost his ability to walk independently and required significant assistance for his activities of daily living including eating, dressing, and bathing. He had several falls per week often resulting in soft tissue injuries. He was reported to have difficulty with concentration and executive functioning both at school and at home due to his uncontrolled seizures.\\nAn initial MRI was normal and an EEG noted mild nonspecific slowing (7 to 8 Hz background frequency) with no obvious epileptiform activity. A genetics referral was made with requests for chromosomal microarray, Rett syndrome testing, CK, and a metabolic work-up. Genetic testing revealed a microduplication at Xq28 of 430 megabases, involving three genes: IRAK1, MECP2 and FLNA.\\nThe patient was started on valproic acid (VPA) at 10 mL BID to be continued for two years. Since starting VPA, he was seizure-free. His brother, who was found to have the same MeCP2 duplication, also remained seizure free on VPA.\\nHowever, due to findings of thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia in the proband, the VPA was stopped. Following the discontinuation of VPA, he had a re-emergence of his epilepsy with an increase in his drop seizures. He was trialed on a multitude of other anticonvulsants, including Levetiracetam 1500 mg BID (9 months), Lamotrigine 150 mg BID (6 months), Oxcarbazepine 900 mg QAM-1200 mg QHS (4 months), Lacosamide 200 mg BID (3 months), Topiramate 150 mg BID (9 months), and Clobazam 10 mg QHS (ongoing) with no success. Given that the patient remained refractory to polytherapy and that the reported hyperbilirubinemia is a very rare occurrence, the VPA was re-started with close monitoring of transaminases and bilirubin levels. Laboratory studies showed a normalization of platelets and bilirubin levels.\\nUpon re-challenge, his convulsive seizures were controlled with a significant decrease in frequency of his drop attacks occurring 1-2 times daily. Initially he would have 20-30 drop seizures each day accompanied with unresponsiveness, greatly affecting his ability to function. However, with the reduction in seizure activity, his activities of daily living and school performance improved markedly. In addition, as per parent report, the removal of the sedating anticonvulsants made him less drowsy. Overall, his improved functioning translated in reduced caregiver stress and better quality of life for the patient.\",\n",

The infant was small for gestational age, born at 1.984 kg (ninth percentile on the Fenton growth chart for preterm girls).\\nThe pregnancy was complicated by maternal tobacco use. The mother was positive for group B streptococcus, and she received clindamycin for intrapartum prophylaxis due to penicillin allergy. She was also late to acquire prenatal care, having been seen initially at 20 weeks gestation. The remainder of the mother's prenatal testing was unremarkable, and there was no other pertinent maternal history. There were no abnormalities noted on prenatal imaging.\\nThe mother presented to the outside (referring) hospital with spontaneous preterm labor. The delivery was complicated by vacuum assistance. The infant was vigorous at delivery and did not require resuscitation.\\nThe referring hospital contacted the tertiary care facility after multiple congenital anomalies were noted on physical examination. The infant was transferred to the level 4 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\\nUpon arrival at the NICU, the infant was noted to have multiple congenital anomalies. Both hands exhibited brachydactyly and hypoplasia of the nail beds of the fifth digits the left hand lacked the distal phalanx of the second digit. Both feet exhibited oligodactyly of the fifth digits, with right 2-3 syndactyly and left 2-3-4 syndactyly. Bilaterally, the medial malleolus at the tibial insertion was abnormal, with circumferential narrowing of the lower leg. In the lumbosacral region, there was a caudal appendage, 3 cm x 0.5 cm, lateral and 2.5 cm to the right of midline with no apparent bony involvement (Figure 1).\\nThe infant had multiple imaging studies while in the NICU. Head ultrasound, renal ultrasound, and echocardiogram were normal. A skeletal survey confirmed the limb abnormalities noted at the physical exam. A spine ultrasound showed that the conus medullaris terminated at L2-3 (lower limit of normal) and had a thickened filum with decreased oscillation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed a small syrinx at the distal thoracic cord. There was an elongated soft tissue appendage (caudal appendage) emanating from the level of the right iliac crest and extending inferiorly along the right gluteal region. It did not appear to involve or extend from the ileum or iliac crest. There was evidence of a central fibrous structure, but likely not fascial nor cartilaginous.\\nPediatrics subspecialties including genetics, orthopedics, neurosurgery, general surgery, and plastic surgery were consulted during the NICU hospitalization. Genetics recommended obtaining a chromosomal microarray and outpatient follow-up. The surgical subspecialists recommended no acute interventions and outpatient follow-up. The remainder of the patient's 6-day hospitalization was unremarkable. She had jaundice but did not require phototherapy. She fed well and was near birth weight at the time of discharge.\\nThe infant had multiple follow-up appointments with pediatric subspecialists over the first year of life. At 6 months of age, she was seen by a pediatric plastic surgeon, at which time the caudal appendage measured 6.5 cm x 1.5 cm (Figure 2). Additionally, there was a diffuse soft tissue mass deep to the appendage measuring 7.5 cm in diameter. Excision of the caudal appendage was scheduled for 1 year of age. Repair of the syndactyly on the left and right feet was not recommended at the time because the risks outweighed any benefit. She was noted to have plagiocephaly and torticollis, which were being treated with physical therapy.\\nAt 6 months of age, she was also seen by an orthopedic hand surgeon. Repeat X-rays of both hands were obtained and showed no change in the abnormalities previously seen on imaging. Upon evaluation, the decision was made to offer surgical webspace deepening with syndactyly release and possible full-thickness skin grafting involving the left ring and small fingers:to be coordinated with the caudal appendage excision.\\nChromosomal microarray results were non-diagnostic but showed a small deletion that included EPHA3, which has no associated phenotype. There was no consanguinity. At the 6-month follow-up, the geneticist concluded that findings were consistent with amniotic band syndrome.\\nAt 1 year of age, plastic surgery removed the caudal appendage and underlying soft tissue mass. Skin was taken from the appendage for grafting during the hand surgery repair. Gross and histologic examination of the excised caudal appendage and underlying mass revealed skin and subcutaneous mature fibroadipose tissue. After the appendage and mass were excised, the orthopedic hand surgeon performed full separation of the fourth and fifth digits of the left hand, with full-thickness skin grafting; a cast was placed on the left upper extremity.\\nThe patient was evaluated by a general pediatric orthopedic surgeon shortly after the procedures described above. Radiographic imaging at that time showed no changes in the abnormalities of her feet bilaterally. Given that the patient was not experiencing functional limitations due to the toe abnormalities, observation was recommended. Of note, she was found to have bilateral acetabular dysplasia, for which she was fitted with an abduction brace.\\nPostoperative follow-up with the pediatric orthopedic hand surgeon showed appropriate wound healing at the site of the syndactyly release and skin grafting, with no evidence of infection. She had full digital range of motion at that time.\",\n",

A physical examination revealed crackles in his right lower chest, and laboratory findings revealed his white blood cell (WBC) count (14.8 x 103/muL; 74.4% neutrophils), C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration (13.0 mg/dL), prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (1.41), activated partial thromboplastin time (36 seconds), and fibrinogen concentration (475 mg/dL). Chest radiography showed homogeneous opacity consolidation in the right mid and lower zones (Fig. 1A), and chest CT showed consolidation, with an air bronchogram in the middle lobe of the right lung (Fig. 1B).\\nHence, the patient was admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia and treated with intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin (3 g every 8 h). A sputum culture obtained upon admission was positive for both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter was believed to have settled in his respiratory tract and not be pathogenic. On day 9, the patient's chest CT showed necrosis inside the consolidation; we continued intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin (3 g every 6 h) and diagnosed a lung abscess. Additionally, we administered intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 24 h), given that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was considered to be related to the lung abscess. Over the following days, the patient's general status improved, including defervescence of the fever with decreases in his WBC counts and CRP levels. On day 29, the patient suddenly demonstrated massive hemoptysis. The following day, MDCTA indicated an enhanced nodule inside the abscess, suggestive of a PAP (Fig. 2A and B). We urgently performed pulmonary angiography, which confirmed the presence of a PAP (Fig. 2C). We guided a 5-Fr Goodtec(R) angiographic diagnostic catheter (Goodman Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) and a 1.7-Fr Nadeshiko(R) micro-catheter (JMS, Shinagawa, Japan) to the PAP and subsequently performed embolization with two 0.018-inch embolization coils (3-2 and 4-2 mm coil diameters) (Tornado(R); Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), Histoacryl(R) (B.

At Al-Aflaj Hospital, he was hemodynamically stable with active bleeding from the wound. The initial trauma resuscitation was done according to the Advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. In the emergency department, they intubated him to control the airway, applied pressure dressings over the wound, and inserted a left intercostal tube (ICT) to drain the hemothorax. He was then shifted to the operating room (OR) immediately. The general surgeon extended the supraclavicular wound and applied multiple bulldogs (vascular clamps) to get temporary bleeding control (Figure 1). The patient was then transferred to KSMC trauma center as a life-saving case for definitive surgical management.\\nClinical findings: the patient arrived at KSMC at 02:30 AM on July 14, 2021. The emergency department physician activated the trauma team, and the trauma team evaluated the patient immediately. On presentation, he was intubated and mechanically ventilated, with oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rate was 92 beats per minute, and his blood pressure was 109/63 mmHg without isotropic support. He was sedated with reactive pupils. His left hand was cooler than his right hand, but well perfused (oxygen saturation 98-99% in all fingertips). There was no palpable pulse, but a Doppler signal was present in his left upper limb. Chest X-ray showed a left hemothorax (Figure 2 A), and the left ICT drained 700 ml of blood. The venous blood gases showed a pH of 7.35, bicarbonate of 21.7, PCO2 of 36.1, a base deficit of 3.4, lactate of 2.2, and hemoglobin of 7.6 gm/DL. The massive transfusion protocol was activated, and the OR personnel was alerted.\\nTimeline of current episode: the patient was stabbed in the left neck in the evening at 7 PM on 13 July 2021 and presented to KSMC in the early morning at 02:30 AM on 14 July 2021. After initial trauma assessment, resuscitation, and investigations, he was taken to the emergency OR on the same morning at 5 AM. He was discharged from the hospital on 25 July 2021 and had an outpatient clinic follow-up on 2 August 2021.\\nDiagnostic assessment: the patient was hemodynamically stable. He was shifted for computed tomography (CT) brain and CT angiography (CTA) for the chest, neck, and left upper limb. The CT brain was unremarkable. The neck and upper limb CTA showed a complete cutoff at the left SCA after its origin. A severe metallic beam-hardening artifact was causing difficult evaluation of the second part of the left SCA. There was also a hematoma surrounding the left axillary vein with a patent lumen (Figure 2 B). The left AA and brachial artery appeared patent. There was also a left moderate to a large amount of hemothorax (Figure 2 C). After returning from the CT, the patient became hypotensive and a transient responder to fluid resuscitation in the emergency department. The left intercostal drain output increased to 1.2 l in the next 2 hours.\\nDiagnosis: hemodynamically unstable penetrating left subclavian vessel injury.\\nTherapeutic interventions: the patient was shifted immediately to the OR. Intraoperatively, a left supraclavicular incision with clavicular division was performed. Proximal control of the left SCA was difficult, and there was evidence of continuous blood oozing in the chest cavity. He became unstable on the OR table, requiring inotropic support to maintain hemodynamics despite ongoing blood transfusion. Immediate median sternotomy was performed (Figure 3). Two to three liters of blood were evacuated from the left chest cavity. The ligation of the injured subclavian vessels achieved hemostasis. The left upper limb showed good perfusion throughout the procedure, as evidenced by good pulse oximetry signals. His left upper limb was not significantly swollen, and there was no emergent sign of compartment syndrome. Therefore, we did not proceed with upper limb fasciotomy. The patient received seven units of packed red blood cells, four units of fresh frozen plasma, and four units of platelets during the procedure. Postoperatively, he was shifted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.\\nFollow-up and outcome of interventions: his postoperative course was uneventful. After gradual weaning from inotropes, he was extubated on the second postoperative day. He was moved to the general ward the following day. The ICT was removed on the ninth postoperative day. The limb was mildly swollen compared to the right limb, perfused throughout, and there was no neurological deficit. A follow-up CT angiography showed postsurgical intervention, with a finding of ligation of the proximal left SCA. Refilling of the SCA s distal segment and its branches was noted down to the left upper limb (Figure 4 A). On the eleventh postoperative day, the patient was discharged with advice to use left upper limb compression stockings (class 2) for swelling. The outpatient clinic s follow-up showed a well-perfused and neurologically intact left upper limb. His left upper limb swelling had reduced significantly and become almost normal. The chest radiograph was also unremarkable (Figure 4 B).\\nPatient perspective: the patient had no complaints when he was examined in the clinic following surgery, and the checkup was unremarkable. He conveyed his heartfelt appreciation for the surgical team.\\nInformed consent: written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publishing the article.',\n",

He has OI type 1 (classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae), which was diagnosed early because of a fractured clavicle at birth and confirmed with DNA analysis (c.588 + 5G>A pathogenic variant in the COL1A1 gene). The clinical manifestations consisted of multiple fractures of the pelvis and the long bones (more than 10 since childhood), the presence of blue sclerae and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The most recent DEXA scan showed low BMD with a T-score of -2.3 for the lumbar spine and a T-score of -3.5 for the left hip. There was a positive family history with his mother and sibling being affected with OI type 1 as well.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with cT3N2M1c non-small cell lung cancer with ipsilateral and mediastinal lymph nodes and multiple brain metastases after analysis for headache, dysarthria, apraxia and memory loss. Because of the relatively young age of the patient and absence of extracranial metastases, the multidisciplinary tumor board decided to treat the brain metastases with stereotactic radiotherapy for a long-lasting effect, but with a palliative intent.\\nDepending on the volume of the metastases, a stereotactic dose of 1 x 18 Gy, 1 x 21 Gy or 1 x 24 Gy was prescribed for five metastases using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) with three 6 MeV photon Flattening Filter Free (FFF) beams. In this example, the adjacent skull received a mean dose of 7 Gy without special dose planning restrictions on the skull (Fig. 1).\\nBecause of the high complications risk, due to chest deformities that may cause respiratory problems, cervical fragility that may lead to difficulties during intubation and due to possible hyperthermia caused by anesthesia, surgery for the lung tumor was not recommended. The patient was therefore referred for sequential radiotherapy. A dose of 25 x 2.6 Gy was prescribed to the lung tumor and the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, using one 10 MeV photon VMAT arc. No extra radiotherapy dose planning constraints for the bone of the chest or other tissue types were prescribed.\\nDuring and after brain irradiation and lung radiotherapy, the patient did not experience any extra acute side effects or difficulties regarding OI.',\n",

Because of extensive bone deformities, she has been wheelchair-bound since childhood. The most recent DEXA scan showed low BMD of the lumbar spine with a T-score of -6.0. In addition to the bone fractures, this patient is also under surveillance of the cardiologist because of a mildly dilated ascending aorta and aortic root of 38 mm.\\nAt the age of 12, the patient experienced painful swelling of his left femur due to hyperplastic callus formation after a femoral fracture. To slow down and eventually resorb the callus formation, the patient was referred for radiotherapy. The left femur received a prescribed dose of 5 x 4 Gy, using anterior posterior-posterior-anterior (AP-PA) fields of 6 MeV photons to the whole left femur. Shortly after the treatment, the swelling and pain in the left femur decreased.\\nTwenty-three years later, at the age of 35 years, the patient was again referred to the radiotherapy department, now because of pain due to callus formation of the medial side of the right femur. A dose of 5 x 4 Gy was prescribed to the right femur using an AP-PA field of 10 MeV photons (Fig. 2). During and after the treatment no acute side effects were noticed and again the pain and swelling responded very well to the radiotherapy.\\nAt age of 59, the patient was again referred to the radiotherapy department because of recurrent pain of his right femur. A radiotherapy planning-CT was conducted, but because of the mild character of the pain, and after shared decision making with the patient, radiation therapy was eventually not performed.\\nWe aimed to measure effects of radiotherapy on BMD of the 2 patients in skull and femur. Although the gold standard for measuring BMD is the DEXA scan, several reports show Hounsfield Units (HU) derived from CT scans to be an accurate estimate for BMD. To put findings in perspective, mean HU of ten occipital skulls and ten right femora of healthy patients of matching age were assessed.\\nComparison in mean HU of exactly matched areas of bones of our patients could be made prior and post radiotherapy, using the radiotherapy planning-CT scans that were conducted sequentially in both patients. In individual 1, mean HU were measured in the high dose (1 x 7 Gy) area of the adjacent skull to the occipital brain metastasis (Fig. 1). In individual 2, mean HU were measured in the target area of the right femur (Fig. 2) and in a non-irradiated area of the right femur. See Table 1 for the results.',\n",

She was admitted elsewhere and underwent incision and drainage of the abscess. A culture from the abscess grew MRSA sensitive to vancomycin (MIC less than 1), trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole, clindamycin, tetracycline, and linezolid. She received intravenous vancomycin (MIC less than 1) for 10 days with apparent resolution. The abscess recurred in the same location 7 and 15 months after the initial episode. These recurrences were managed with incision and drainage, and oral trimethoprim-sulfmethoxazole. Cultures of the drainage consistently grew MRSA with the same susceptibility pattern. The patient reported that the wound healed with treatment each time.\\nNineteen months after the initial episode, the abscess recurred and she was seen in our emergency department. Computerized tomography of the chest showed right upper and middle lobe parenchymal abnormalities suggestive of granulomatous infection, paraspinal abscess formation, periosteal thickening and osseous changes involving the 3rd to 6th vertebral bodies and right 3rd rib. She noted a mild cough. She denied back pain and neurological symptoms. Incision and drainage was performed and she was referred to the pulmonary clinic. Multiple sputum cultures were negative for bacteria and acid fast bacilli. Magnetic resonance imaging showed changes similar to those on the CT scan. She received oral trimethoprim-sulfamethazole for 5 months but repeat CT showed minimal improvement. She was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management.\\nHer past medical history included intermittent asthma managed with albuterol inhaler as needed. She smoked one pack per day for 5 years but stopped 1 year prior to admission. She denied alcohol or drug abuse. There was no family history of recurrent infections. She was afebrile. Physical examination was normal except for a 2 cm x 2 cm fluctuant mass on the right upper chest. There was mild tenderness at the site, but no erythema. She had coarse facial features and a wide nasal bridge. Her appearance was notably different from her sister.\\nComplete blood count and serum chemistries were normal except for mild eosinophilia. Drainage of the abscess grew MRSA. A tuberculin skin test and HIV testing were negative. Culture for acid fast bacilli from the abscess was negative. Serum IgE level was 1489 IU/mL (normal 0-180 IU/mL). IgG and IgA levels were mildly elevated. IgG subclasses, complement CH50, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and neutrophil oxidative burst test were normal. Computerized tomography again showed a paraspinal collection now extending from the 2nd to the 8th thoracic vertebrae, with mild bone destruction also involving the right third rib (Fig. 1).\\nIntravenous vancomycin was started and continued for 5 weeks via PICC line on discharge, followed by oral linezolid for 6 months. The chest wall abscess resolved rapidly and she remained asymptomatic, but there was no improvement in the radiographic abnormalities on CT scanning.\\nSix months later she was readmitted with right shoulder pain, upper back pain and fever. Computerized tomography and MRI showed enlargement of the paraspinal collection. Transesophageal echocardiography showed no evidence of endocarditis. Gallium and bone scans were normal. Under CT guidance, she underwent transcutaneous aspiration of the paraspinal collection. The drainage was grossly purulent and grew MRSA. Two weeks later, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was attempted but due to extensive adhesions was converted to open thoracotomy to permit debridement of the paravertebral collections. Her antibiotic regimen was changed to daptomycin plus rifampin for 6 weeks followed by linezolid and rifampin.\\nThree months postoperatively she was improved with resolution of the back pain and a weight gain of 14 pounds.

Apart from hypertension and dyslipidaemia, he had no smoking history or any known major coronary or cerebrovascular disease. He also had no neurological signs or symptoms and was able to carry out his activities of daily living independently.\\nComputed tomography (CT) angiography confirmed the 7.2 cm fusiform aneurysm of the distal aortic arch, with an ectatic ascending aortic segment measuring up to 3.7 cm in diameter and a descending thoracic aneurysm measuring 4.2 cm (Fig. 1). Arch branches had atheromatous changes but were patent without significant stenosis. The abdominal aorta was also aneurysmal at 4.3 cm but the patient did not have any abdominal symptoms or lower back pain.\\nBased on symptomatology, age, rupture risk, and CT imaging, a plan was proposed for a percutaneously inserted 226 mm by 38-44 mm (diameter) custom made device (CMD) with an 8 mm diameter left common carotid artery (LCCA) fenestration and an innominate artery (IA) scallop (Fig. 2), along with occlusion of the left subclavian artery (LSA).\\nDuring the procedure, access was obtained using ultrasound (US) guided puncture of the right and left common femoral arteries (CFA) for insertion of 6 and 8 F sheaths, respectively. LCCA puncture, sited above the left clavicle, was performed in a retrograde fashion with US using a 4 F micropuncture set before insertion of a 6 F sheath. Intra-arterial heparin 5000 units was administered and an arch aortogram was performed with a pigtail catheter in the ascending aorta.\\nThe LSA was next occluded by deployment of a 14 x 10 mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II, proximal to the vertebral artery origin. Next, the Cook CMD was introduced via the right groin and positioned proximal to the origin of the IA. Its preloaded wire was snared from the LCCA access to obtain through and through passage before continued deployment to expose the LCCA fenestration fully. A 10 x 27 mm BeGraft was deployed via the LCCA across the CMD fenestration and flared. The final check angiogram showed a patent IA and LCCA along with an occluded LSA origin without obvious leak. The left VA and distal SCA could be seen to be perfused via collateral flow (Fig. 3).\\nHaemostasis of both groin accesses was obtained with suture tightening of prior inserted Abbott Perclose ProGlide suture mediated devices in preclose fashion. For the LCCA access, the patient's head was first rotated to the right and a single Perclose ProGlide device was inserted under fluoroscopy with standard manufacturer technique over a short Terumo 0035 wire positioned above the aortic cusps. Intra-venous protamine was given for reversal and manual compression further applied. Haemostasis was confirmed visually and using sonography. Operative time was two hours and ten minutes.\\nThe patient recovered well and was discharged on post-operative day two. Follow up CT a month later showed that the stent graft, LCCA fenestration and IA were patent, and that the proximal LSA had been occluded as planned with collateral perfusion of the left VA and LSA distal to the vascular plug (Fig. 4).

       "    'case_text': 'In this section, we summarise what is known of the case. Ramsey was transferred from his home in Cambridge to Guy\\'s Hospital on 10 January 1930 for investigation and management of worsening jaundice. His medical history was essentially unremarkable. He had neonatal jaundice and ill-defined \"digestive\" issues as a child. But by adolescence, he was a competent athlete and as an adult appeared to enjoy good health. He was a tall man tending towards weight gain:in his early 20\\'s, he weighed nearly 17 stone: 240 lbs/108 kilos. Assuming his height was around 6 feet 4 (1.93 metres), his body mass index was about 29: overweight but not obese. He was physically active, including vigorous hiking and wild swimming. He was described as having \"tremendous vitality\". He was a member of the Bloomsbury set:a group of intellectuals and artists who lived life to the full and were known to have open marriages, as did Ramsey and his wife, the former Lettice Cautley Baker, who became a renowned photographer. While Lettice had multiple sexual partners, Ramsey appears to have had only one other: Elizabeth Denby, a senior civil servant and social housing reformer.\\n In mid-November 1929 Ramsey developed an acute febrile illness after a College feast (a formal occasion involving many courses of rich food, washed down with much alcohol). Nobody else attending the feast is known to have become ill, and there seem to have been no sick contacts, though Lettice developed a brief febrile illness in late November from which she recovered uneventfully. Within 10 days of the onset of fever, Ramsey developed jaundice with malaise, but no abdominal pain and no signs of bleeding or bruising. Progressive jaundice and malaise persisted for over six weeks. His cognitive status remained more or less normal throughout this period (no suggestion of encephalopathy), though he sent notes apologising to academic colleagues that he was unable to focus on his work.\\nOn January 10, 1930 Lettice contacted her uncle, Robert Davies-Colley, a senior surgeon at Guy\\'s Hospital, who arranged for Ramsey\\'s admission. He was evaluated by a physician and a surgeon who apparently concurred on proceeding with a laparotomy to evaluate for biliary stones or other treatable cause of obstruction. Lettice wrote to Wittgenstein with an account of her understanding on Wednesday, January 15:\\nFrank was operated on Saturday afternoon, because, after 8 weeks in bed he showed no improvement. My uncle, who\\'s a surgeon, came from London to see him and thought that he should be brought to London to Guy\\'s hospital. So we took an ambulance & came. Then there was a consultation with a physician (as opposed to a surgeon) & firstly they agreed that an op would be best. They found his gall bladder very inflamed & are draining it. There was no stone. I have seen Frank twice today, for a few moments. He is still too much under the effect of drugs to like any company . . . The dose of morphia that is always given after an op had a bad effect on him & he had to have something to counteract it. ( : 418)\\nThe above quote contains what appears to be an error by Lettice, since the actual date of the operation was Tuesday 14 th; Ramsey died on Sunday 19 th. While the surgery did not reveal an obstruction, \"the whole liver and kidneys were found in a frightful condition\". ( : 425)\\nThe records suggest that a partial autopsy (\"P.M. Examination of the abdominal organs\") was performed but no findings from this are available. The death certificate simply read:\\n      Cause of Death:      1 (a) Cholangitis (b) Infection of smaller bile ducts\\n                                      2 Hepatitis.\\n                                                      P.M. Examination of abdominal organs\\nLettice said that Frank \"died of an infected liver\". Davies-Colley told Ramsey\\'s father it was \"a degenerative disease of the liver which was bound to end fatally\". Lionel Penrose (father of British genetics and himself a medical doctor) was one of Ramsey\\'s best friends, and apparently had a different view. He would later allude to the possibility that medical malpractice was the cause of death and he was wracked with guilt about not having been around to step in and save his friend ( : 425).',\n",

The consultation team included vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, hematologists, oncologists, plastic surgeons, and pathologists.\\nThe patient had an unremarkable medical history.\\nAt clinical examination, the girl showed functional impairment of the right knee (limited flexion of 30%), muscle contracture, and localized pain (Figure 1). In the days before her hospitalization, the reported daily mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for chronic pain was 7  +-  1. Neurologic examination revealed normal patellar tendon reflex, full strength of the surrounding musculature, and normal superficial and deep sensitivities. Dermatological examination revealed normal skin characteristics.\\nIt was reported that no therapeutic procedure had been carried out previously, and the pain symptoms had been controlled with pain relievers, when necessary.\\nLaboratory blood tests for coagulation were performed, according to the high rate of variations in coagulation states that are found in patients with vascular anomalies. No abnormalities were observed in our young patient.\\nIn addition to clinical signs, diagnosis of FAVA was based on both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Both imaging modalities showed a complex mass of 11 cm x 8 cm x 8 cm in the right thigh, a finding compatible with FAVA malformation, located in the vastus medialis muscle and marginally in the rectus femoral muscle. The T1-weighted MRIs showed heterogeneous and hyperintense signal related to the fat component (Figure 2), and the injection of intravenous contrast clearly revealed the malformed venous component. The solid mass was found to have partially replaced the normal vastus medialis muscle fibers, with fibrofatty overgrowth and varied appearances of clusters of thick-walled muscular vessels; multiple soft-tissue planes were found to be involved as well, showing hypoechoic intralesional clots or development of phleboliths, with low-flow venous parameters that were also barely detectable by Doppler sonography.\\nFollowing discussion and consensus by the interdisciplinary team, differential diagnoses of other commonly confused vascular lesions (i.e., venous or arteriovenous malformations or vascular tumors) were ruled out.\\nThe primary end point of this patient's treatment was radical FAVA treatment. The secondary end points were pain relief (assessed by VAS) and recovery of functional impairments.\\nPrevious clinical experiences in the literature describe the frequent use of sclerotherapy and percutaneous cryoablation procedures for FAVA and the high risk of blood loss and nervous system damage related to primary surgery in FAVA. Thus, the multidisciplinary team proposed an original hybrid treatment strategy of primary percutaneous ethanol embolization of the FAVA and a secondary surgical excision of the mass.\\n Informed consent statement: Written consent was obtained from both parents of the patient, because she was a minor at the time of hospitalization.\\n Institutional review board statement: The Institutional Review Board of Guarnieri Clinic provided approval for this study (IRB No. 19/1721).\",\n",

Nonetheless, the SPECT imaging report noted a mild to moderate multifocal pattern of hypoperfusion in the white matter, patchy hypoperfusion in the left lenticular nucleus, and regional hypoperfusion in the anterior temporal cortices (trace to mild) with some generalized increased heterogeneity of cortical perfusion bihemispherically, all consistent with small vessel disease. No pattern of hypoperfusion on SPECT was seen that would be suggestive of large vessel disease, neurodegenerative disease, or psychiatric disorder.

The patient also has a homozygous mutation of the MTHFR gene, which codes for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, resulting in high homocysteine levels which lead to blood vessels damage and finally strongly increase the risk of blood clots.\\nHer past medical history was also remarkable for a Fanconi-like tubulopathy, low stature secondary due to GH deficit, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and gastritis; from 2010, the patient suffered a progressive accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material in the lungs, resulting in dry cough and slight exertional dyspnea, with diffuse ground glass opacities (GGOs) on HRCT scans, which remained stable during radiological follow-up. On the last follow-up visit, only 1 month previously, the last pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed a restrictive respiratory disorder (forced vital capacity:FVC: 57% predicted; forced expiratory volume in the first second:FEV1: 55% predicted; Tiffeneau Index 89% predicted; the patient was not able to perform diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide:DLCO).\\nThe patient was referred to the G.B. Morgagni:L. Pierantoni Hospital in April 2023 due to a rapid onset of acute respiratory failure, complicated by a right pneumothorax. Two weeks before our admission, the patient experienced a respiratory tract infection treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and chest tube insertion.\\nOn admission, physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 120/75 mmHg, a heart rate of 85 bpm, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, and a hemoglobin oxygen saturation of 78% on oxygen (FiO2 40%) delivered through the nasal cannula; she was afebrile. Subsequently, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a severe acute type 1 respiratory failure (pH 7.37, pO2 34.5 mmHg, pCO2 40.9 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 85). The patient was quickly adapted to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with a FiO2 of 55% and a flow of 60 L/min, which rapidly improved gas exchange and increased hemoglobin oxygen saturation to 91%. Chest auscultation revealed severely reduced respiratory sound and bilateral crackles, while cardiac auscultation was normal. Chest x-ray (Figure 1) showed a right apical pneumothorax (with chest tube previously inserted) and extensive diffuse bilateral consolidations with bronchus sign.\\nSubsequently, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest (Figure 3A) showed areas of diffuse ground glass with superimposed interlobular septal thickening (\"crazy paving\" pattern) and a right pneumothorax.\\nBlood tests showed increased neutrophil count (WBC 16.7 x 109/L, neutrophils 14.9 x 109/L) and reduced hemoglobin levels (Hb 8.0 g/dl). LDH was markedly elevated (1,404 U/L), while CRP and procalcitonin were within normal range.\\nTherefore, the decision was made to proceed with WLL, which was performed on two different days. Under general anesthesia, airway management and lung isolation were achieved using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DL-ETT). Bronchoscopy confirmed the correct placement of the DL-ETT; a bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a foamy, thick, whitish material, which on rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was shown to contain lymphocytes and acellular proteinaceous eosinophilic material.\\nAfterward, the patient was positioned on left lateral decubitus, and single lung ventilation was set with FiO2 100%. During the first procedure, a total of 5,500 mL, in aliquots of 1,000 mL, of warm (37 C) sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) were instilled in the right lung (Figure 3B). At each cycle, physiotherapists performed chest percussion maneuvers to optimize proteinaceous fluid clearance over a period of 2 min when the maximum volume has been infused and during the drainage phase.\\nFluid input and output were carefully monitored and registered. However, for safety reasons, the procedure was prematurely discontinued because the patient showed a SpO2 of 42% during the fifth aliquots infusion, probably due to a rapid worsening of mismatch in ventilation/perfusion ratio (V\\'A/Q\\') during the filling phase.\\nThe patient was immediately supinated, and bilateral lung ventilation was restored with a rapid increase of SpO2 up to 91%. The ABG performed showed severe respiratory acidosis (pH 7.07, pO2 94.2 mmHg, pCO2 114.5 mmHg, HCO3- 25.3 mmol/L); blood pressure was 115/65 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and, after the normalization of gas exchange and resolution of respiratory acidosis, extubated in 36 h. During the second procedure, a complete left lung lavage and a partial right lung lavage were performed (Figure 2). The second procedure was better tolerated, and after 24 h ICU, the patient was extubated. In total, 8 L of saline solution (for the right lung) and 7 L of saline solution (for the left lung) were needed to complete the lavage. Chest HRCT (Figure 3C) performed after the WLL showed a dramatic improvement of the GGO and the appearance of a left pleural effusion, possibly secondary to intraoperative hydro trauma, which rapidly responded to diuretic therapy with furosemide.\\nThe patient was discharged without the need for long-term oxygen, with a SpO2 of 97% while breathing room air.',\n",

She also referred a frontal, tension-type headache, of moderate intensity with no signs of intracranial hypertension. There were no other focal neurological symptoms, fever or infection, chest pain, epistaxis, haemoptysis or telangiectasias. Family diseases were denied.\\nThe patient was haemodynamically stable (blood pressure 138/42 mmHg; pulse 78 bpm, regular and rhythmic). Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15/15. Neurological examination revealed touch and pain hypoaesthesia of the left upper limb with no further findings. The patient's National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 1. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, without any alterations. Head CT and supra-aortic and intracranial CT angiograms were performed and revealed a recent fronto-insular right infarction.\\nA stroke was assumed and the patient was admitted to the medical ward. No cardiovascular risk factors were identified during hospitalization. Immunological, infectious, endocrine and hypercoagulable states were ruled out. Magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1) was performed to assess the extent of cerebrovascular disease and revealed several recent cortical embolic infarctions in both hemispheres: in the bilateral fronto-insular cortex, right posterior temporal lobe and right post-central parietal gyrus. No embolic source was identified on transoesophageal echocardiogram. Venous Doppler ultrasound of both lower extremities carried out 5 days after admission revealed varicose dilatations in both popliteal veins and the right external saphenous vein, absence of the left external saphenous vein, and no evidence of thrombi in the veins.\\nThe physical examination was also remarkable for labial cyanosis and discreet digital clubbing. Blood gas analysis demonstrated hypoxaemia, and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient (AaG) with no response to oxygen therapy, indicating a shunt. Platypnoea was denied, but orthodeoxia was found, with a desaturation of 4% in the supine position. Laboratory findings showed polycythaemia (Hb 17.7 g/dl, Hct 48.6%), erythropoietin (EPO) was elevated, and testing for the JAK2 mutation was negative. D-dimers were elevated at admission (894 ng/ml). Chest x-ray did not show any abnormalities (Fig. 2).\\nContrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a right-to-left shunt, with simultaneous opacification of the right and left cavities during the fourth cardiac cycle, indicating an extra-cardiac shunt (Video 1). Patent foramen ovale (PFO) was excluded by transoesophageal echocardiography.\\nFollowing discovery of the shunt, a contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan was performed, which demonstrated a pulmonary arterio-venous malformation in the right lower lobe, showing communication between the subsegmental branch of the right inferior lobar artery and the tributary vein of the right inferior pulmonary vein, with a diameter of 25x21 mm in the axial plane (Video 2).\\nNeurological deficits stabilized, but left upper limb hypoaesthesia remained.

       "    'case_text': 'It is about a 24-year-old male patient suffering a dental trauma at the level of the anterior upper teeth. The patient presented with fractured upper central teeth and a mobility of the coronal fragment of tooth 12 due to the trauma.\\nIn this article, we focused on the maxillary right lateral incisor, with respect to the patient constent. Inspection revealed the presence of a healthy periodontium with pulpal exposure. The retro alveolar radiograph showed a long root of the tooth with no fracture and no apical radiolucency (Figures 1 and 2). After removing the coronal fragment, we noticed a lack of supragingival tooth structure required to guarantee a reliable long-lasting restoration. The next steps consisted in evaluating the radicular length, the absence of an apical curvature, and the width of the remaining radicular and coronal walls to discuss the feasible treatment options for saving the tooth.\\nAfter a global clinical examination, surgical tooth extrusion, consisting in crown lengthening technique, was performed to maintain a healthy supracrestal healthy tissue, thus offering to the patient a reliable long-term outcome. The clinical procedures involved, at first, endodontic treatment. It was conducted prior to surgical extrusion. Canal preparation was carried out using rotary instrumentation system (Revo S , Micro Mega, France). It was accompanied by intracanal irrigation using 2.5% NaOCL and 17% EDTA as a final irrigation. At the same clinical consultation, the canal was dried with sterile paper points. The root canal was filled with gutta-percha (ProTaper Universal Gutta Percha Points, Meta Biomed, South Korea) and root canal sealer, using the lateral condensation technique. The coronal seal was provisional. After 1 week, the surgical extrusion procedure was performed.\\nAfter disinfection of the area using mouthwash of 0.12% of chlorhexidine (KLOREX fort, STODERMA, Tunisia), local anesthesia with 2% of lidocaine was administered. Syndesmotomy was performed using a syndesmotome, placed in both the buccal and palatal sides. A fine elevator was used to carry out tooth luxation. It was placed in the periodontal space and manipulated in a walking motion all around the tooth without causing surgical trauma. Minimally, traumatic luxation forces were applied just at the first 4 mm of the radicular structure to avoid periodontal ligament damage.\\nThe tooth was carefully extruded to the desired situation using root forceps and it was placed at a level such that the fractured margin would be situated at least 3 mm from the alveolar crest, while being kept inside the socket. It is important to limit the extrusion quantity to preserve an adequate crown-root ratio that should always be inferior to 1.   The tooth was maintained at the radicular portion, supposed to be kept in a supra-bony position after the procedure. A slight pressure was applied in a bucco-palatal direction, using a gauze, to obtain hemostasis and to keep the tooth in the right position. Simple interrupted sutures were placed to stabilize the tooth. A 0.3-mm diameter monofilament (violet braided of PGA Lac Synthetic Absorbable Suture, NEOFIL+) was used to achieve primary stabilization, thus obtaining a correct reorganization of the periodontal ligament fibers.   After that, a semi-rigid splinting was placed using a flowable nano-hybrid composite (Reflectys Flow, ITENA, France) on the adjacent teeth. Special attention was exerted to release the interdental septum so that it would be easy for the patient to keep it clean. The patient was instructed to use a daily mouthwash with 0.12% of chlorhexidine for 1 week to thoroughly clean the area. Only analgesic was prescribed post-operatively (Figure 3). The sutures were deposed after 10 days to avoid surgical site infection. In fact, microbes adhere to the suture filament and form biofilms. The knot is the principal site of infection. Typically, they should be left in place no longer than 2 weeks.   Splinting was removed 15 days post-operatively. In fact, the risk of ankylosis increases when the splint is kept for more than 3 weeks.   Actually, a slight mobility during the periodontal healing period is favorable.   Six weeks later, the extruded tooth mobility was clinically acceptable. In fact, the periodontal ligament acquires its characteristics 45 days post-operatively.   Then, a fiber post (Fiber Post Refill Dentoclic, ITENA Clinical Dental Post, France) was placed to ensure correct height to the core preparation. It was cemented with a dual core composite cement (Dentocore Body, Core Build-up, ITENA) that was utilized as a core build-up material to rebuild the missed coronal tooth structures (Figure 4). A crown preparation was performed and a temporary crown was cemented. Six months post-operatively, impressions were taken and a final ceramic crown was placed (Figures 5 and 6). After 2-year follow-up, complete periapical bone formation is observed with a periodontal tissue repair (Figure 7).',\n",

Evaluation noted right axillary adenopathy, which prompted a biopsy of the mass and of the cyst-like lesion. Pathology demonstrated morphologic and immunohistochemical (strongly cytokeratin-20, neuron specific enolase and CD56 positive and thyroid transcription factor-1 negative) findings in both lesions consistent with MCC. Polymerase chain reaction performed on deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue alongside appropriate controls using a previously described protocol demonstrated that the tumor lacked detectable Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) large T antigen and small T antigen. Staging fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) revealed lesions in right upper lung, right upper back, right axilla and right adrenal gland consistent with metastatic disease (Fig. 1a, b and c). Subsequent biopsy of the right lung confirmed metastatic MCC. Following extensive discussions regarding the implications and options, he refused chemotherapy. At that time, no clinical trial was available to him, but programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor therapy was being tested on trial (ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT02267603). Nivolumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody, was obtained from Bristol-Myers-Squibb outside of a clinical trial, and he was subsequently treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for six cycles in 2015. Following two cycles, he had an excellent partial response on physical exam with decreased adenopathy. After five cycles, he achieved a marked partial metabolic response by FDG-PET/CT (Fig. 1d, e and f). He continued on therapy, but after cycle six, treatment was complicated by pneumonia and autoimmune hepatitis. He improved on intravenous steroids at an outside hospital and was discharged on prednisone 1 mg/kg per day. He completely recovered with a slow steroid taper, and no further treatment with nivolumab was given. He continued on surveillance alone for 8 months, and his disease remained well controlled with no recurrence on physical exam and at least an excellent partial response in his distant metastasis with no new sites of disease.',\n",

The patient had been healthy until three days before admission, when she developed fever. She had no history of intravenous drug use, recent dental procedures, heart murmurs or cardiac abnormalities. Six months earlier, she had had her nasal septum pierced, and subsequently she frequently removed her jewellery to hide it from her parents, putting it back in place again later.\\nOn admission, physical examination revealed hypotension, dehydration and a clinical presentation suspicious for sepsis, with multiple Janeway lesions on the volar surface of her feet and hands, furunculosis on the legs and Osler lesions on the periungual area of two fingers. Neurological examination revealed a mild cognitive deficit, left extremity weakness and incapacity to coordinate the left side of her body. At the level of the nasal septum, an erythematous, ulcerative bleeding lesion was present in the mucosa previously perforated by a nasal piercing.\\nBlood cultures obtained on admission were strongly positive for a blood-borne staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. Whole body computed tomography (CT) (Figure 1a) revealed two contrast-enhancing lesions within the left cerebellar and occipital cerebral regions, suggestive of septic emboli. Multiple similar lesions were observed in the liver, spleen and kidneys (Figure 1b). Fundus oculi revealed septic emboli (Roth lesions). Serial trans-thoracic echocardiography showed a pedunculated 15 x 13 mm vegetation sitting on the anterior mitral leaflet at the level of the postero-medial commissure, which was considered embolizing, according to the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. A mild mitral valve incompetence was also detected (Figure 2).\\nBroad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with gentamycin, vancomycin and linezolid was initiated. When the antibiotic assay demonstrated a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strain (MSSA), vancomycin was replaced with oxacillin. After 6 days of treatment, the patient remained febrile, with blood cultures still positive for MSSA, prompting the addition of tigecycline to the antibiotic regimen.\\nOn the eighth day following the admission, a whole body CT demonstrated reduction in spleen, kidney and liver size and number of lesions. However, MRI of the brain revealed abscessualization of the cerebellar lesions (Figure 3).\\nOn day 11 of treatment, the patient's condition improved and fever had disappeared. In order to remove the vegetation dangerously fluctuating in the left atrial cavity and correct the mitral valve incompetence, although the duration of antibiotic therapy was deemed not yet complete, surgical intervention was performed on April 1, 2008 by means of median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass and antegrade tepid blood cardioplegia. The vegetation was removed and a posteromedial commissuroplasty was performed.\\nThe immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and echocardiographic controls revealed a well functioning mitral valve. However two weeks after surgery heart failure developed and the patient presented with increasing dyspnoea, tachycardia and a new systolic murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed massive mitral insufficiency with concomitant pulmonary hypertension. For these reasons, a new surgical procedure was required and performed on April 23, 2008. The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, partially destroyed by the infection, was repaired with an autologous pericardial patch and an A3-P3 edge-to-edge valvuloplasty technique was employed to complete the mitral valve repair. A prosthetic ring was then sutured to the posterior segment of the mitral annulus to stabilize the repair.\\nPostoperatively, linezolid, tigecycline and oxacillin were administered for 40 days. Subsequently ceftriaxone and rifampicin were administered until the cerebellar lesions were no longer evident on MRI.\\nThe patient was uneventfully discharged on the fortieth postoperative day. A long term antibiotic treatment was prescribed in order to completely eradicate the cerebellar abscesses. Serial echocardiographic examinations were performed. At one year follow-up the patient appeared to have fully recovered and the mitral valve was functioning showing only trivial regurgitation.\",\n",

Her blood pressure was initially 157/100 mmHg and controlled with nicardipine infusion. Subsequent blood pressure was 132/70 mmHg. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.0. She was not taking anticoagulants or antithrombotics. While in the emergency department, her neurological examination rapidly worsened. She was intubated for airway protection and was transferred to the neurosciences intensive care unit (NSICU).\\nOn arrival to the NSICU, she was on a nicardipine infusion for blood pressure control. Her blood pressure was well controlled initially in the 130/90 s range but acutely fell to 80/50 s. The infusion was immediately stopped. Patient was bolused with normal saline and started on norepinephrine infusion. She subsequently became unresponsive to central or peripheral noxious stimulation. She had absent brainstem reflexes except for over breathing the respirator. She was hyperventilated and given 100 g of mannitol. Train-of-four was then performed and showed four twitches. Repeat CT of the head showed hematoma expansion to 47 cc with intraventricular extension (Figures 2 and 3). There was now effacement of the basilar cisterns as well as uncal, central, and tonsillar herniations (Figures 2 and 3).\\nOver the course of the next day, she stopped breathing over the ventilator. Confounding variables on the neurological examination were excluded (Table 1). Brain death testing ensued. She was found to have brainstem areflexia. Prior to apnea testing, her core temperature was 36.1 C, systolic blood pressure was 141 mmHg, and PaCO2 was 39.6 mmHg. After pre-oxygenation, her PaO2 was 83 mmHg. With continued pre-oxygenation, the PaO2 increased to 279 mmHg (Table 2). She was subsequently disconnected from the ventilator with 5-6 liters per minute of oxygen delivered via red rubber catheter to the carina. During testing, there were no cardiopulmonary complications. Her systolic blood pressure remained 140 mmHg without any vasopressors. Her oxygen saturation remained 96.2%-99.3%. There were no cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory movements. However, the duration of the apnea testing was 110 min before PaCO2 reached the required level of >60 mmHg and serial blood gas analysis was obtained during this entire 110 min (Table 2).\\nAt the end of the apnea testing, she was reconnected to the ventilator. It was then noticed that she had tidal volumes of 30-35 cc with a \"respiratory rate of 44\" which corresponded to her heart rate on telemetry (Figure 3). Given the unusual duration of apnea testing, ancillary testing was subsequently completed. Four-vessel cerebral angiography confirmed cerebral circulatory arrest (Figure 4).

No significant pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites, were isolated from her blood or were found in the contents of her colon. She tested negative for HIV and human T-lymphotropic virus type (HTLV)-I viruses.\\nColonoscopy on admission revealed widespread shallow ulcers in the rectum and coarse mucosa with mucous, pus, and blood in the sigmoid colon (Fig. 1A and B). The mucosal vascular pattern disappeared, and the erythematous mucosa was friable and bled easily. Although there were no active UC findings from the cecum (terminal ileum) to the splenic flexure (Fig. 1C), we found long luminal edematous swelling and multifocal discharge of pus throughout the descending colon (Fig. 1D and E). The mucosa of the descending colon appeared to be nearly intact. Computed tomography immediately after colonoscopy showed a diffusely thickened wall with a narrowed lumen and intramural air-filled abscess cavities and multifocal low-density areas of abscesses (Fig. 2), particularly within the wall of the descending colon. There were no diverticula of the colon, which was confirmed by the prior findings of colonoscopy and computed tomography. Antimicrobial therapy with doripenem hydrate 0.5 g intravenously every 8 h was started, as well as intravenous hyperalimentation. 2 weeks after starting treatment, she became afebrile and pain-free, and her C-reactive protein level was normalized. Oral intake was restarted with an elemental diet, and she was later discharged home after confirmation of the improvement of her condition via colonoscopy (Fig. 3A and B) and computed tomography (Fig. 3C). She is still being followed up at our out-patient department, and both oral and anal administration of 5-ASA have maintained clinical remission of her UC. IFX has not been reintroduced.',\n",

Needle aspiration was performed, but only necrotic tissue could be collected. We did not analyze the karyotype since the symptoms suggesting the Klinefelter syndrome were not observed. Therefore, a clinical diagnosis of malignant teratoma was made, and three courses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy were administered because AFP levels continuously increased. After chemotherapy, AFP levels decreased, although the size of the tumor did not change, as evident in a computed tomography (CT) scan. Next, tumorectomy and total right lung extraction were performed. The pathological diagnosis of the extracted tumor was malignant teratoma with areas of yolk sac tumor (Figure 2).

Prior to presentation in our hand surgery clinic, the patient had a history of bilateral shoulder pain following a motor vehicle collision status post left rotator cuff repair; the patient elected to defer right shoulder replacement until she was more symptomatic. Approximately 5 years after her initial injury, she experienced worsening pain in her right shoulder. A large effusion was drained and an arthroplasty was scheduled. However, she continued to have progressive swelling, weakness, and numbness of her right upper extremity. A duplex ultrasound ruled out deep venous thrombosis. Due to concern for lymphedema, she was fitted with a compression sleeve and began physical therapy. She was referred to a hand surgeon who preliminarily diagnosed her with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and right-sided cubital tunnel syndrome, but advised a second opinion given her lymphedema and unusual clinical presentation. Her sensory and motor function continued to worsen over the course of 6 months, involving both the ulnar and median nerve distributions of the right hand; electrodiagnostic testing was performed with equivocal results, as the report noted that the diagnostic quality of the exam was limited by right upper extremity lymphedema. She was also noted to have neck pain that was relieved by cervical traction so additional imaging was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a soft tissue mass encasing the right brachial plexus divisions and cords without axillary lymphadenopathy, as well as severe chronic rotator cuff arthropathy with a large shoulder effusion (Figure 1).\\nOn evaluation, the patient demonstrated profound deficits of the right upper extremity. Motor function was notable for shoulder abduction limited to 10  and inability to abduct, adduct, or cross her fingers. Sensation was absent in the fourth and fifth digits and diminished with paresthesia in the index and middle fingers. Her thumb sensorimotor exam was normal.\\nThe patient was referred to interventional radiology for an image-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, but the specimen obtained was non-diagnostic. Due to concern for malignancy, an open excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. Intraoperatively, the lateral and posterior cords of the brachial plexus appeared very swollen and a heavy, fibrotic perineurium was noted. A tissue sample of the epineurium was obtained, as well as two lymph nodes, one infraclavicular and one supraclavicular. External neurolysis of the lateral and posterior cords was performed.\\nHistological examination of the brachial plexus mass and adjacent tissue revealed adipose tissue infiltrated by low-grade carcinoma. Immunostaining was consistent with primary breast cancer that was estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive, and Her2/neu negative (Figure 2). Both lymph nodes that were resected were negative for carcinoma. Full oncologic workup included a staging positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, which was negative for an FDG-avid primary mass but showed multiple foci of bony sclerosis in the thoracolumbar spine and sacrum without FDG avidity, as well as focal FDG uptake in the left L5 transverse process, indeterminate for metastasis. No breast abnormalities were noted on PET/CT scan, and no breast MRI was performed as part of her workup. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) levels were not elevated.\\nOf note, the patient had been up to date with annual screening mammograms, all of which had been negative including the most recent one performed several months after the onset of her right upper extremity symptoms, 5 months prior to her excisional biopsy. Interestingly, she had a 15-year history of oral contraceptive use, followed by a 20-year history of hormone replacement therapy after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Her family history was notable for Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Comprehensive genetic testing with the Invitae Common Hereditary Cancers Panel was negative for all 46 tested genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PTEN, and PALB2.\\nIn the setting of metastatic disease to the brachial plexus without imaging findings of a primary tumor or nodal involvement, treatment focused on medical and radiation therapy rather than surgical resection. The patient was treated first with palliative radiation (37.5 Gy in 2.5 Gy daily fractions) to her right brachial plexus, followed by letrozole and palbociclib. These treatments were well tolerated, and she showed improvement in right upper extremity strength, sensation, range of motion, and pain.\\nAfter completion of radiation treatment and 2 months of letrozole and palbociclib, she was reevaluated in our hand surgery clinic. On motor exam, she demonstrated significant improvement of right shoulder abduction to 80 , as well as normal strength and range of motion of the elbow. She had normal wrist extension but moderate weakness with wrist flexion. Most notably, she lacked active flexion of her right thumb and digits at both the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints; however, finger extension was preserved. On sensory exam, she endorsed subjective paresthesias of the thumb and index finger with two-point discrimination of 7 mm and numbness in the remainder of the digits with two-point discrimination >20 mm. Due to these significant functional limitations, she underwent a brachialis to anterior interosseous nerve transfer to restore active thumb, index, and middle finger flexion.\\nOverall, the patient has been doing well and has been stable on letrozole and palbociclib. From a functional standpoint approximately 1 year after surgery, she notes improved range of motion, sensation, and active movement of her right hand. She was started on zoledronic acid due to concern for bony metastases, but her most recent restaging imaging was negative for breast mass, axillary lymphadenopathy, enlargement of the brachial plexus mass, or osseous or other distant metastasis.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'This patient is a 56-year-old African American female who still works as an elementary school principal with a history of IGG kappa multiple myeloma diagnosed 15 years prior to admission, refractory to chemotherapy treatment. Previously, in 1992, she was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) but was then diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1997 when she was found to have a lytic lesion and compression fracture of the T7 vertebra. Subsequent treatment included radiation, dexamethasone, thalidomide, bortezimide, lenalidomide and bendamustine between 1997 and 2012. She was then treated with carfilzomib. Over the years, she developed chronic kidney disease due to Bence Jones proteinuria, anorexia, chronic anemia (requiring multiple blood transfusions), multiple electrolyte abnormalities and herpes zoster for which she remained on prophylaxis. She had widespread lytic bone lesions and pathological fractures, which remarkably had not been accompanied by significant pain.\\nPatients with myeloma commonly present with malaise and bone pain, and not uncommonly with a fracture that may result from a neoplastic mass or may result from osteoporosis induced by the plasma cell effect on bone marrow. Myeloma plasma cell infiltration results in bone resorption and osteolysis. The balance of bone osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity is upset. Osteoclast-activating factors secreted by the plasma cells begin a vicious cycle of osteolysis and tumor growth resulting from released cytokines. Imaging studies, old and new, are employed to diagnose the cause of bone pain, to help establish staging in the Durie-Salmon System, and to follow treatment. Radiographic skeletal surveys, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine, and MRI are all useful in an evaluation. Newer modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), have been used to study relapse.\\nOur patient suffers from one of four patterns of bone involvement, myelomatosis or diffuse skeletal involvement. Other forms are solitary plasmacytoma, diffuse skeletal osteopenia, and sclerosing myeloma. Radiographic skeletal survey, though insensitive for early disease, is positive in 75% of patients by the time a diagnosis is established. The axial skeleton, the spine, skull, pelvis, and ribs are more often affected than the limbs (Figs. 1-3). Lesions are almost always lytic. More than two clearly defined lytic lesions place patients like ours in Durie-Salmon Stage III disease. Therefore, the skeletal survey is recommended in all cases of newly diagnosed myeloma.\\n Computed tomography (CT) has a role in clarifying ambiguous lesions, in assessing fracture risk by demonstrating the amount of residual cortical bone, and in guiding biopsy when needed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to establish the burden of disease, especially in the spine, that is prone to myeloma, and therefore at risk of fracture and spinal cord compression. In Stage III disease, patients with normal spine marrow pattern respond better to therapy and achieve remission more often. MRI is best and CT is second best in assessing the presence, the level, and the severity of myeloma-related spinal cord compression. The two techniques may be complementary in clarifying ambiguous lesions. Both MRI and CT detect extra osseous extension of disease.\\nStandard radionuclide bone scan with technetium 99-m relies on osteoblastic activity for tracer uptake, and myeloma is nearly exclusively osteoclastic. As many as half of myeloma lesions visible on radiographs are normal on the bone scan.\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) has a role in assessing the extent of extramedullary disease, and follow-up of these patients, but not in routine follow-up of treated myeloma in bone.\\nSpine fractures may be treated with vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty, and helpful in treating pain and spinal deformity. MRI is important to evaluate for potential pre-procedure spinal cord compression by a mass.\\nMultiple myeloma is becoming a more chronic disease, with life extended by successful chemotherapy. Knowing when, where, and why to use the full range of imaging described above will allow for accurate staging of the disease and to modify therapy as necessary, and to decrease the morbidity associated with fractures and spinal cord compression.',\n",

The patient was seen at another hospital with complaints of testicular enlargement but did not receive medical treatment at that time. More recently, the patient underwent a spectral and color Doppler ultrasound revealing a large complex left hydrocele with a 1.7 cm regular, heterogeneous solid structure within the upper anterior aspect possibly representing the left testis. Surgery was then performed a month later, 1300 cc of straw-colored fluid was noted, and the hydrocele sac and left testicular nubbin were removed via scrotal orchiectomy. After pathological review and consultation, the specimen was confirmed to be malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid type. The tumor demonstrates predominantly an exophytic papillary growth although in areas it is solid and invasive into the underlying tunica vaginalis. The neoplastic cells are epithelioid with cuboidal to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figures 1-3). By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells are positive for WT-1, calretinin, and focally for D2-40, while BAP-1 is retained.\\nFollow-up for positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan did not reveal any hypermetabolic foci except for a small 9 mm hypodense nodule in the right lobe of thyroid gland.\\nRadical excision is planned and chemotherapy planned after more extensive surgery.',\n",

Radiographs of the abdomen disclosed that in the left upper quadrant, a large lesion causing inferomedial displacement of the bowel loops was present. US revealed a large, mixed-echoic, solid and cystic mass in this same area (Fig. 1A), while unenhanced abdominal CT scans depicted a well-defined heterogeneous mass with intratumoral nodular calcifications (Fig. 1B) and a suspicious focal area of fat density. Enhanced abdominal CT scans showed a large, exogastric, solid and cystic mass arising from the greater curvature of the stomach, with continuity between this curvature and the intraluminal extension of the mass. These scans also indicated that the solid portion of the mass was well enhanced (Fig. 1C). The differential diagnosis was germ cell tumor such as teratoma or stromal tumor of the stomach, neuroblastoma, or a mass originating in the tail of the pancreas. A pre-operative diagnosis of teratoma was based on the presence of intratumoral calcification and mixed cystic and solid components of the mass.\\nThe tumor was totally excised, involving partial gastrectomy, and the defect in the stomach was repaired. The gross specimen of the round exogastric mass thus obtained measured 14 x 9 x 6.5 cm and originated from the posteroinferior wall of the stomach along its greater curvature (Fig. 1D). The protruding intraluminal polypoid mass, measuring 7 x 5 x 3 cm, formed a continuation of the exogastric mass and was entirely covered by serous membrane. It contained multiple cystic areas filled with serous and mucinous material, keratin, and hemorrhagic foci. Histologically, the tumor contained not only mature components such as chondroid tissue, squamous epithelium, and keratin, but also multifocal aggregates of immature neural tissues of neuroblasts. The pathologic diagnosis was immature teratoma of the stomach. Three months later, follow-up CT revealed neither evidence of tumor recurrence nor distant metastasis.',\n",

Drug history included insulin in addition to linagliptin, perindopril, and rosuvastatin. The patient has no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Family history included diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\\nVital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination was unremarkable apart from partial left sixth cranial nerve palsy with no associated nystagmus or other cerebellar signs.

Neck and head examination revealed no associated swellings or palpable lymph nodes, and the temporomandibular joint were normal.\\nInitial tests showed WBC of 8.8 x 103/L, C-reactive protein of 15.3 mg/L, HbA1C of 7.2 %, normal kidney function tests, and a negative HIV serology. Radiological assessment with CT head (Fig. 1) demonstrated thickening of the external auditory canal and middle ear with an ill-defined soft tissue mass pacifying the right mastoid air cells cavity.

       "    'case_text': \"The patient was a previously healthy 45-year-old male who had never undergone surgery before and sought hospital care for intense epigastric abdominal pains irradiating to the back and weakness. The possibility of acute appendicitis was ventured during the consultation, because of involuntary guarding at the iliac fossa during physical examination and leukocytosis. It was decided to supplement work up with abdominal computed tomography (CT). The CT report described arteriopathy of the celiac trunk, with caliber reduced by approximately 73%, and arteriopathy of the superior mesenteric artery, with 40% narrowing; enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes; and thickened gallbladder. The patient was scheduled for exploratory laparoscopy in view of the refractory nature of his pain. No abnormalities that could explain the patient's pain were identified during this procedure and all possible causes of acute abdomen were ruled out. The patient was discharged from hospital promptly, with improved symptoms.\\nAfter the tomographic findings from the previous admission, the patient was scheduled for abdominal angiotomography the following month, which found stenosis of the celiac trunk (50%) (Figure 1). After around 6 months, another angiotomography study was performed, which is when thickening of the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm was observed for the first time, with compression and 80% stenosis of the proximal third of the celiac trunk.\\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic surgery to relieve compression of the celiac trunk. During the operation, the common hepatic artery was dissected in the direction of the celiac trunk, where the fibers of the arcuate ligament were released and the adjacent celiac ganglion was removed. While releasing the celiac trunk, it was necessary to partially section the splenic and common hepatic arteries to gain access to the fibers of the arcuate ligament, since these vessels were intrinsically linked to the filaments, which caused moderate bleeding, that was controlled with primary arteriorrhaphy (Figure 2). The patient was given intraoperative blood transfusion with packed red blood cells and was taken to intensive care for postoperative recovery, progressing to hospital discharge 3 days later.\\nThe patient remained asymptomatic during the postoperative period and underwent a control angiotomography (Figure 3) 2 months after surgery, which showed improved celiac trunk stenosis at 60-70%, in addition to critical stenosis of almost 100% of the proximal segment of the splenic artery, with distal flow fed via collateral circulation originating from the gastroduodenal artery. Currently, 1 year after the surgical intervention, the patient remains asymptomatic and has chosen not to undergo further imaging exams, in view of his stable condition.\",\n",

The pain was described as pressure-like, pleuritic, made worse with ambulation and when supine. It was constant, increasing in intensity and not associated with any alleviating factors, hence her request for evaluation. She had denied any history of trauma, fevers, cough, night sweats nor hemoptisis. She denied any dyspepsia, and noted no relief of her symptoms with over-the-counter antacids.\\nSix weeks prior to the onset of her chest pain she had complained of right hip pain, radiating down the leg. This was diagnosed as radicular pain secondary to sciatica for which she had been under bed rest and analgesics. This slowly improved, and she had reinitiated full ambulation about two weeks preceding her presentation.\\nHer past medical history was remarkable for depression and occasional migraine headaches, both of which had been controlled. She was gravida 2, status-post two cesarean sections, the last of which was performed five years prior. She was started on oral contraception five months earlier, Yaz , in addition to Topiramate and Escitalopram. She denied any life-long toxic habits. Her family history was remarkable for lymphoma in her mother. She had no known family history of coagulopathy or other hematological conditions.\\nUpon presentation to the hospital she was evaluated for her chest pain by way of cardiac enzymes and complete blood count, which were both normal. An initial chest radiograph was also noted to be normal, as was an EKG. Nonetheless, a CT scan of the chest using a protocol to evaluate for a pulmonary embolism was performed which was remarkable for a large filling defect involving the left main pulmonary artery and extending into all sub-branches, most pronounced in the left lower lobe (Figure 1A, Figure 1B, Figure 1C). There appeared to be a mass extending outside the vessel wall. In addition, there was evidence of focal infiltration into the adjacent lung parenchyma with pre and post contrast Hounsfield units of 15 and 60, respectively. This was suggestive of a pulmonary angiosarcoma.\\nIn view of the pulmonary artery occlusion, she was admitted and closely monitored. She had an unremarkable hospital course, which included a negative work up for coagulapathy. With improvement of her chest pain, she was sent home on anticoagulation with warfarin. An FDG-PET scan was later performed, which did not reveal any FDG-avid lesions. A subsequent bronchial-alveolar lavage and pulmonary function testing were also unrevealing. Interestingly, she underwent open thoracotomy for excision of the left thoracic mass, and at the time of surgery no mass was found. There was only evidence of a chronic pulmonary embolism of the left pulmonary artery which was evacuated. Following her surgery, she developed pleural effusions managed with diuretics. Due to progressive dyspnea, even at rest, she was reevaluated in the emergency department. A repeat CT scan of the chest was then positive for bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left, with adjacent atelectasis, but no evidence of pulmonary embolism. A thoracentesis was performed with cytology negative for malignancy and findings consistent with a transudate.',\n",

She had an indwelling urethral catheter inserted, because of the total urinary incontinence, for a period of over eight years. This catheter was last changed twelve weeks prior to her visit to the urology clinic by her district nurse. The patient had positive MSUs in the year prior to her admission demonstrating mixed growth of enteric organisms, but no prior febrile urinary tract infections were reported.\\nShe received radical radiotherapy alone for a muscle-invasive bladder tumor (stage T2b) in 1991 and underwent abdominal exploration for drainage of an appendicular abscess when she was in her early twenties. The patient had a background history of cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. She was felt to be an unsuitable candidate for radical surgery for her invasive bladder cancer due to these comorbidities. The decision to manage her incontinence with an indwelling urethral catheter was made having discussed available treatment options with the patient. A long-term indwelling catheter was felt to be the most appropriate option for her given her other extensive comorbidities. She did not have urodynamic testing prior to urethral catheterization. The exchanges of the catheter were being carried out every three months in the community and there had been no reported difficulty with her previous catheter changes. The patient was not undergoing routine cystoscopic surveillance of her bladder. \\nOn physical examination she was generally unwell with low-grade fever and pallor. Her abdomen was soft, mildly tender with no palpable masses and no signs of peritonitis. Her urethral catheter drained feculent material mixed with urine.\\nLaboratory investigations showed a low hemoglobin of 7.8 gm/dL, white cell count of 17 109/L with a C reactive protein of 233. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the abdomen and pelvis were performed urgently and were reviewed by a senior consultant radiologist and his impression was that those images confirmed the presence of the inflated balloon of the indwelling urethral catheter in the lumen of a bowel segment (Figures 1  and 2). \\nIn enterovesical fistulas treatment is undertaken depending on the aetiology, clinical status and general condition of the patient. Enterovesical fistulae seldom close spontaneously. Given the nature of the pathology in this case and the presence of a foreign body in the fistulous tract (the urethral catheter), it was felt that the only way forward was to perform an urgent laparotomy and removal of the foreign body with excision of the fistulous tract. The situation was explained to the patient and she was consented for laparotomy, with all the risks and potential complications of surgery fully explained including both urinary and faecal diversion. On laparotomy there were severe adhesions, and the catheter balloon was found to have penetrated through the bladder wall and was lying in a terminal ileal segment adherent to bladder wall. Excision of this segment and urinary diversion by fashioning an ileal loop conduit was performed. A Hartmann's procedure was carried out due to the high clinical suspicion of presence of another separate colovesical fistula. The patient was transferred postoperatively to the intensive care unit and was moved afterward to the urology ward for 10 days. She had a smooth postoperative course with no recorded complications and is currently on regular urology outpatient clinic followup. Histology from the resected segment of terminal ileum demonstrated chronic inflammation only with no evidence of tumor recurrence.\",\n",

She had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her consciousness level was Glasgow Coma Scale E3V4M5. The SAH grade was Hunt and Hess Grade 3 and WFNS Grade 4. The thickest hematoma of the SAH was noted in the interhemispheric fissure on computed tomography (CT) [Figure 1a]. CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed an azygos ACA with hypoplasia of the A1 segment of the right ACA [Figure 1b]. Three-dimensional rotational angiography indicated a small and conical aneurysm measuring 0.7 mm in height, with a 1.2 mm neck located on the bifurcation of the distal azygos trunk. This small aneurysm was arising from the distal end of the azygos trunk to the left pericallosal artery [Figure 1c]. This aneurysm was considered to be ruptured because of the absence of obvious aneurysms on other angiography and the distribution of the SAH in the CT. DSA after waiting for 4 days under sedation showed obvious enlargement of the aneurysm [Figure 1d]. This small aneurysm was diagnosed as a ruptured BLA located on the distal bifurcation of an azygos trunk based on its size, shape, and growth. Direct clipping and endovascular treatment using simple coiling and balloon-assisted coiling seemed to have a high risk for intraoperative rupture due to the BLA. Trapping with an anastomosis was also difficult because the aneurysm was located on the azygos trunk. Therefore, it was decided to perform stent-assisted coiling (SAC) on the same day as the follow-up DSA. Immediately after the follow-up DSA, dual antiplatelet agents were administered in loading doses (aspirin 200 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg) 4 h before the start of the endovascular treatment. First, a 6-Fr FUBUKI guiding sheath (Asahi Intec, Aichi, Japan) was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced to the left cervical ICA. A Headway 17 microcatheter (Microvention, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) was navigated over a CHIKAI 0.35-mm (0.014-inch) microwire (Asahi Intec, Aichi, Japan) into the left pericallosal artery with a 3.4-Fr Tactics (Technocrat, Aichi, Japan) placed on the A1 segment of the left ACA as an intermediate catheter [Figure 2a]. An Excelsior SL-10 (Stryker Neurovascular, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) shaped by steam on a 45-degree curve was placed in the proximal part of the aneurysm using a Traxcess 0.30-mm (0.012-inch) microwire (Microvention) because of the difficulty of placing the microcatheter inside the aneurysm. After a 2.5-mm * 17-mm low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) Jr (Microvention) was deployed to just the distal neck of the aneurysm, a Galaxy G3 mini 1-mm * 20-mm (Cerenovus, Irvine CA, USA) was poured into the aneurysm. Two loops of the coil were placed inside the aneurysm by the microcatheter placed in the proximal of the aneurysm, which moved gradually with the coil protruding from the tip. The half-deployed stent was placed across the neck of the aneurysm to the end [Figure 2b]. Final postembolization DSA showed that the contrast effect of the aneurysm disappeared [Figure 2c]. Because a thrombus was found at the origin of the right pericallosal artery [Figure 2d], the patient was administered 80 mg of ozagrel sodium, and no blood vessels occluded. No new postoperative neurological deficits were found, and magnetic resonance imaging-diffusion-weighted imaging showed multiple spotty high intensities in the ACA region bilaterally [Figure 3], and magnetic resonance angiography showed no vessel occlusion. Follow-up DSA 14 days after onset showed residual aneurysm with contrast inside the dome. However, the findings showed stagnation of contrast in the venous phase and did not show contrast along the aneurysm wall, so follow-up was continued [Figure 4a]. Follow-up DSA 30 and 90 days after onset showed that the aneurysm thrombosed gradually and reached complete occlusion 90 days later [Figures 4b and c]. The patient had a good outcome, with a 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 and mild disturbance of memory as a sequela.',\n",

He was not obese (BMI 21.4 on admission, when he was edematous), and he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg, a regular pulse of 85 beats/min, and a respiration rate of 25 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation in the room air was 100%. An examination of the head revealed a marked, right-sided facial droop, but was otherwise normal. Carotid upstrokes were symmetric without bruits. The heartbeat was regular without gallops or murmurs, and the lungs were clear; the abdominal examination was also normal. Bilateral pitting edema was present to the knees. There were no rashes or petechiae. Neurological examination revealed intense dysarthria, which made it difficult for him to communicate with others, and right-sided central facial nerve palsy. Both the right arm and leg were at Brunnstrom stage 1, with complete flaccidity and no voluntary movement. Pain and light touch sensation were absent on the right side of his body.\\nTable 1 contains initial laboratory data. Blood counts revealed leukocytosis and hemoconcentration. Serum albumin was markedly low at 1.8 g/dl. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were elevated. The urine protein to creatinine ratio was 7.5 g/g Cr, indicative of high-grade proteinuria. The examination of the urine sediment revealed oval fat bodies, and testing for anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-phospholipid antibodies were all negative. Hepatitis B and C serologies were negative.\\nDiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed high-intensity areas consistent with acute infarction in the left basal ganglia, left corona radiata, and left cerebral cortex (fig. 1). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the neck revealed collateral blood flow around a large embolus in the left carotid artery (fig. 2). Ultrasound of the left carotid revealed the embolus without any plaques or ulcers at the vessel wall (fig. 3). There were no aortic dissections, pulmonary emboli, renal vein thromboses, or deep vein thromboses on the computed tomography. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal contractility without dilated chambers, valvular disease, vegetations, intraluminal thrombi, or any findings suggesting pulmonary embolism, such as pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular stress.\\nA presumptive diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular accident caused by a left carotid thromboembolism was attributed to a hypercoagulable state due to NS. Because of the lack of any findings of atherosclerosis or plaques at the left carotid, we believed that embolism was more likely than thrombosis. The origin of the embolus was not detected despite a thorough cardiovascular evaluation. Immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was employed, and the renal biopsy was deferred. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered empirically at 1,000 mg/day for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone at 60 mg/day. Cyclosporine was added 30 days later in response to persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria (5.5 g/day on the 28th day). The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 47 days after first admission.\\nHowever, the blood examination performed after transfer revealed abnormal liver function on the 74th day from the first admission, the results of which are detailed in table 1. Serological studies and abdominal ultrasound excluded viral hepatitis or biliary obstruction. He was immediately readmitted under suspicion of drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Medications on admission included prednisolone (50 mg/day), warfarin (2.75 mg/day), cyclosporine (70 mg b.i.d.), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (400/80 mg daily), eicosapentaenoic acid (900 mg b.i.d.), atorvastatin (10 mg/day), lansoprazole (30 mg/day), alfacalcidol (0.25 mug/day), andronate (35 mg/week), and calcium lactate (1 g b.i.d.). All medications except for prednisone were subsequently withheld, and warfarin was replaced by intravenous heparin. The liver test results normalized, but they deteriorated upon rechallenge with warfarin.\\nAt this time, heparin therapy was briefly interrupted to permit a renal biopsy to evaluate refractory NS, with hypoalbuminemia (2.1 g/dl) and proteinuria (5.7 g/day). The biopsy showed MN at stage III of the Ehrenreich and Churg classification. Continued anticoagulation was deemed necessary due to severe persistent hypoalbuminemia and the severe cerebrovascular accident. Warfarin appeared to be clinically intolerable due to idiopathic hepatotoxicity despite a negative lymphocyte stimulation test. Intravenous heparin therapy was incompatible with outpatient rehabilitation.\\nWe discussed the indication of dabigatran, the only available novel oral anticoagulant in Japan at that time, with the patient and also with cardiologists, a neurologist, and the vice-principal of our hospital, all of whom were responsible for the prescription of dabigatran, and we decided to initiate treatment. We also explained and discussed the risks and benefits of dabigatran with the patient and obtained his written and informed consent in advance. Oral dabigatran was administered at a dose of 110 mg b.i.d., and MN was treated with oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide according to Jindal's regimen. Proteinuria decreased from a ratio of 5.1 to 1.6 g/g Cr, and serum albumin rose from 2.3 to 3.7 g/dl over 7 months. He was transferred to the rehabilitation hospital 137 days after stroke onset. At the outpatient clinic, his renal function remained stable, and he did not experience any episodes of edema, bleeding, or thromboembolism. We monitored the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to predict the risk of bleeding due to excessive anticoagulation. The aPTT values taken 4 h following administration of dabigatran in the morning were stable at around 40 s (standard aPTT was 30 s). A carotid echogram performed 2 years after the initiation of dabigatran revealed a reduced embolus, although it did still occlude the internal carotid.\",\n",

She never consulted any physicians about her right foot before. There was no history of trauma and infection, but there was a history of uncontrolled type 2 DM in the last two years. She did not consume her oral antidiabetic drugs routinely; her diabetic medication was switched to insulin therapy in the last six months to better control her disease.\\nPhysical examination revealed rocker-bottom deformity, but there was no edema, ulceration, or local rise in temperature (Fig. 1). There was a foot tenderness with visual analog scale (VAS) score of 2-3, a decrease of distal sensory perception, a capillary refill time of less than 2 seconds, and limited ankle range of motion (ROM). CT-scan and plain radiographs revealed the bone deformity of the forefoot with Meary's angle of 22 , Bohler angle of 88 , and Gissane angle of 125  (Fig. 2).\\nAfter establishing the diagnosis, the patient underwent forefoot arthrodesis by using screws and K-wire fixation (Fig. 3). The initial AOFAS score was 45 out of 100, then two months after surgery the score increased to 61. Furthermore, the radiological union of talus was obtained three months after surgery (Fig. 4); the AOFAS score further improved to 69. The AOFAS score continued to increase in the fourth and sixth months follow-up after surgery with a score of 78 and 86, respectively. The foot pain was absent sixth months after the surgery while physical and radiological examination showed improvement of the foot arch and the Meary's angle improved to 8  (Fig. 5). The patient was compliant to post-surgical advices. Thus, there was no complication, and there was an improvement of her overal quality of life.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'In the previous reports with other mydriatics, abdominal adverse effects have been reported. A 2-month-old girl had episodes of apnea, vomiting and distension after a screening for ROP with cyclopentolate 0.5% and phenylephrine 2.5%. Bonthala et al. reported that ocular instillation of 0.2% cyclopentolate and 1.0% phenylephrine eyedrops inhibited duodenal motility and delayed gastric emptying in 11 infants; this might have been caused by a reduction in peristaltic movement of the gastrointestinal tract. ROP screening using cyclopentolate, therefore, might be associated with increased gastric residuals and cyclopentolate was detected in the blood of infants, whereas phenylephrine was not detected in the blood. In another report, the incidence of gastric residual increased after ROP screening with another type and/or dose of mydriatic. In these reports, cyclopentolate was used for ROP screening; therefore, it may cause abdominal adverse effects.\\nIn the present study, neonatal infants with lower body weight at the ROP screening had higher scores of abdominal distention. However, because those infants also had higher scores of abdominal distention before ROP screening, we should be careful about attributing the abdominal adverse effects to the mydriatic (alone). Jiang et al. reported that the incidence of gastric residuals increased after ROP screening in infants with postconceptional age < 31 weeks. Gronlund et al. reported that, in neonatal lambs, the sympathetic nervous system is a major regulator of cardiovascular interactions and that the autonomic nerves are immature. The immaturity of autonomic nerves in neonatal infants might contribute to abdominal adverse effects.\\nIn the current study, compared with the period before examination, there was a significant increase in the number of infants with decreased pulse rate during the period after examination. In some previous reports, pulse rate did not significantly change after ROP screening. However, Khoo et al. reported that pulse rates decelerated below the baseline values after ROP screening. Rosales et al. stated that stress and pain during ophthalmic examinations are known to precipitate apnea and bradycardia. Stress and pain during ophthalmic examination may affect pulse rate until at least 1 day after ROP screening.\\nIn the current study, the volume of stool, respiration rate, blood pressure and number of episodes of apnea did not change significantly after ROP screening (p > 0.05 paired-t tests). In a previous report, a significant elevation in systolic blood pressure was observed in 8 of 10 infants. In a different study, percutaneous oxygen saturation and pulse rate changed significantly from baseline values following ROP screening with 2.5% phenylephrine and 0.5% tropicamide eyedrops. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, temperature, or respiration rate. Jiang et al. reported significant increases in blood pressure after administration of phenylephrine 0.5% and tropicamide 0.5%. Lees et al. reported that blood pressure was significantly elevated but pulse rate was unchanged after ROP screening with 2.5% phenylephrine and 0.5% tropicamide eyedrops. Isenberg et al. also reported significantly elevated blood pressures after ROP screening with 2.5% phenylephrine and 0.5% tropicamide eyedrops, but blood pressure did not change after ROP screening with the same types and doses of eyedrops in a study by Bolt et al.. Thus, there are still controversies about changes in pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure and periods of apnea, which may be due to differences in the kind and/or dose of mydriatics used and/or the time of ophthalmic examination.\\nThe current study had some limitations in that it was a retrospective study, with a small sample size and without control cases. Because we evaluated data only up to 1 day after screening, any long-term effects are unknown. Finally, the cause of the abdominal adverse effects was unclear and not only the mydriatics, but also the ophthalmic examinations themselves, might contribute to the changes seen.\\nIn conclusion, screening for ROP with 0.5% phenylephrine and 0.5% tropicamide eyedrops may have adverse effects on systemic conditions such as abdominal distention, milk consumption and pulse rate. Careful observation for abdominal conditions should be performed after ROP screening with mydriatic.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The animal in this report was a mixed-breed male dog, aged approximately 1 year and 6 months from Belford Roxo, Rio de Janeiro state. The dog was taken for veterinary assistance in a local clinic on May 4, 2021, due to a \"stiff neck,\" open mouth, and excessive salivation. The veterinarian suspected a foreign body obstruction and degenerative disk disease. However, the owner was not confident regarding the diagnosis, so she visited another clinic located in Duque de Caxias City for a second opinion. The animal presented with a stiff neck, left-sided head tilt, and salivation.\\nInitially, the second veterinarian assumed that the salivation was a consequence of a previous morphine injection, which was administered in the first clinic to induce vomiting as the previous veterinarian suspected a foreign body obstruction. The animal was very calm, which made performing the physical examination easy. Gloves were used for protection while evaluating the dog, and upon examination, no neck or mouth injury was detected. Following standard practice, several questions were asked: for example, if the animal had previous contact with bats, and the owner answered affirmatively. When asked regarding vaccine protocols, the owner answered that the animal was not vaccinated against rabies. Hence, she was advised to take the animal for radiographic examination as required in the first clinic to evaluate the neck and return as soon as possible. The veterinarian searched for diagnostic information on rabies, and the radiographic report did not indicate any injuries in the vertebral column or temporomandibular joint.\\nOn the following day, May 5, the owner sent a message and a video through \"WhatsApp\" informing that the animal had a staggering pace. The veterinarian requested that the animal be brought to the clinic immediately for hospitalization and explained his clinical suspicion and severity.\\nUpon admission, the animal entered the clinic at a staggering pace. Venous access was made to inject medications and antibiotics as the blood test revealed signs of infection. A sample was collected for the distemper polymerase chain reaction test, which was later reported to be negative.\\nThe animal then stayed under supervision, and as the hours passed, serious signs of aggressiveness and hostile behavior started to appear, complicating the medical team in handling his attendings. The dog growled and hit the canine box whenever someone attempted to approach it. Incoordination worsened during the night, and the dog struggled to stand and fell repeatedly. Then, it spent the rest of the night lying on the box. On May 6 at 10 am, the dog died after 24 h of hospitalization.\\nThe veterinarian on duty was oriented to put on personal protective equipment (PPE), while handling the animal to place it inside a plastic bag and keep it refrigerated until the veterinarians from the municipal government of Duque de Caxias took the animal to the Rabies Laboratory of Diagnostics.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 38-year old man presented with dysarthria lasting for about one hour, two days after returning from holidays from the island of Corfu, where he had spent several days exposed to strong sunshine. The day after the presentation, the symptoms of dysarthria recurred and lasted about two hours before completely resolving. There were no other neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, confusion, or weakness (except from the baseline weakness due to the polyneuropathy). During his holidays, he was exposed to the sun for more hours than usual, but he did not report excessive use of alcohol or other substances.\\nThe patient was examined on the second day of symptom appearance when he was found to be afebrile with no other signs of infection. His dysarthria had resolved, and the rest of his neurological examination was normal with the exception of the baseline weakness of the lower extremities due to his polyneuropathy.\\nBlood tests including inflammatory parameters as well as an immunological screen were normal and so was urine analysis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. CSF oligoclonal bands were absent.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain was obtained (Figure 1) which showed a diffuse symmetric deep white matter involvement of the centrum semiovale posterior frontal and parietal, with T2/FLAIR hyperintensity and restricted diffusion an ADC map images (first row of images).\\nThe findings extended continuously to the splenium of the corpus callosum (second row of images). No major mass effect was recognized. No hemorrhagic changes on T2/GRE images and no postcontrast enhancement on enhanced T1 images were seen (not shown here).\\nDue to the transient recurrence of the symptoms on the second day of presentation, the patient was treated empirically with corticosteroids (1 gram of intravenous methylprednisone per day for 3 consecutive days). His neurological examination returned to baseline.\\nRepeat MRI examination performed one month later showed significant symmetric improvement of the findings on T2, FLAIR, and DWI images (Figure 1). The FLAIR abnormalities were hardly recognized on the second MRI and had improved both in volume of involvement and intensity. Subtle increased signal could still be traced on DWI images, with no actual restricted diffusion on ADC map images (ADC map normalization).\\nFurther questioning revealed two similar episodes in the past, one at the age of eleven years and one at the age of 21 years. The first episode preceded the diagnosis of CMTX, which was established at the age of sixteen, following the diagnosis of his older brother. The c.381C>G base change in the GJB1 gene resulting in the Ile127Met amino acid substitution in Cx32 was identified in this family. He had experienced recurrent episodes of weakness of the right lower extremity lasting 2-3 hours over the course of 3 days. The medical history had revealed no evidence of infection, travel, intense exercise, or presence of any other provoking factor. MRI was not available at that time, and no medical record of laboratory examinations could be obtained.\\nTen years later, at the age of twenty-one, the patient experienced a more severe episode of dysarthria lasting 4-5 hours. Over the course of the next 4 days, he continued to experience transient dysarthria attacks which subsequently progressed to paresis of the right lower limb. At that time, he had once again been exposed to strong sunshine for prolonged periods of time in the days prior to the presentation due to his work at the beach. Once again, laboratory investigation was entirely normal and he was treated with corticosteroids.\\nThe MRI which, at that time, reported it as a possible acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in retrospect showed very similar findings to the one performed at our institution. The follow-up MRI was done one month later and revealed significant improvement.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"In 2008, a 60-year-old Japanese man was first diagnosed with cT2N0M1 stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung and multiple metastases including the brain and the 12th thoracic vertebra (Th12) (Fig. 1). Irradiation of the Th12 with a total dose of 45 Gy and gamma knife radiosurgery for the brain was performed, followed by treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel as first-line therapy, cisplatin and S-1 as second-line therapy. The patient next received treatment with erlotinib from 2009 to 2014. After the disease progression of lung lesion was detected in computed tomography (CT) in 2014, a lung rebiopsy revealed an activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion) without a secondary mutation (T790M) in exon 20. The patient decided to receive the treatment with afatinib in addition to docetaxel or pemetrexed from 2014 to 2017, even though EGFR-TKI failed to control the disease's progression.\\nSince pelvic pain, caused by bone metastases in 2nd lumber vertebra (L2) and 2nd sacral vertebra (S2), was occurred in 2013, irradiation of L2 and S2 was performed with a total dose of 30 Gy, respectively (Fig. 2). In 2017, the disease progression of lung lesion was further developed in CT, and a liquid biopsy showed a secondary mutation (T790M) in exon 20 of EGFR. Treatment with osimertinib thus has been administered with partial remission.\\nIn 2018, the patient, now aged 70 years, complained of right mild back pain, caused by the lesion with abnormally enhanced signals in right iliopsoas muscle in CT (Fig. 3A). Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT also confirmed the lesion with highly enhanced signals (Fig. 3B). Other lesion still showed partial remission with no change in serum tumor markers for lung cancer, whereas the lesion in right iliopsoas muscle progressed rapidly. A CT-guided biopsy and subsequent surgery of the tumor were performed.\\nA pathological examination revealed proliferation of atypical spindle cells in a random growth pattern (Fig. 4A). On immunohistochemical examination, most of the tumor cells were positive for CD34 (Fig. 4B), and only limited number of the tumor cells was faintly positive for EMA or desmin. By contrast, AE1/AE3, SMA and S-100 were negative. These findings indicate that the tumor does not have noticeable histologic features, and carcinoma with sarcomatous change is unlikely. In light of the morphological and immunohistochemical findings, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma was diagnosed. Importantly, no EGFR mutations was detected by RT-PCR, indicating that the detected sarcoma is unrelated to the primary lung cancer. As the locoregional recurrence occurred 7 months later after the surgery, the patient received the radiation therapy, and is now under outpatient follow-up.\\nIn summary, this patient had undergone radiation therapy, and the sarcoma histologically different from the primary tumor arose from the irradiated field, both of which are consistent with the disease definition of radiation-induced sarcoma.\",\n",

She had been followed since 2008 for primary ITP, initially treated with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day), which achieved complete remission. Because of occasional severe relapses (two between 2009 and 2012, with gynecological bleeding), she was subsequently treated with Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) with good responses. In January 2012, at age 21, she suffered a severe relapse, again justifying the use of IVIg and corticosteroids. At that time, she had detectable autoimmunity with an antinuclear antibody titer of 1 : 250 (anti-SSA specificity but without any sign suggestive of lupus) and platelet-directed anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibodies. In June 2012 (baseline), a new IVIg cycle was administered, followed by RTX (375 mg/m2 once-a-week for 4 consecutive weeks). A complete platelet response was obtained within 6 weeks and, at the last follow-up (March 2015), her blood platelet level was normal (321 x 109/L) without treatment. Before RTX infusion (June 2012), her blood total gamma-globulin level >3 months before IVIg infusion had been normal (8.9 g/L) but she was lymphopenic (total lymphocytes: 0.513 x 109/L), while her peripheral blood lymphocyte count had been normal at ITP diagnosis (1.199 x 109/L). The previously available phenotype profiles of her peripheral circulating lymphocytes are reported in Table 1. No infection occurred during the 3 years following the last RTX administration and she remained clinically well at biannual consultations in our department.\\nAt admission, in July 2015, at age 24, her temperature was 39.2 C and she complained of lower abdominal pain, vomiting but without diarrhea; her physical examination was normal. Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP: 114 mg/L, normal range (NR): <5 mg/L), hepatic cytolysis (aspartate aminotransferase: 144 U/L, NR: 7-40 U/L; alanine aminotransferase: 265 U/L, NR: 5-50 U/L) and cholestasis (alkaline phosphatase: 389 IU/L, NR: 40-130 U/L; gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase: 698 U/L, NR: 5-38 U/L). The hemogram revealed agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia (leukocytes: 4.9 x 109/L; neutrophils: 0.02 x 109/L; hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL; platelets: 46 x 109/L). Bone-marrow aspirate showed normal density, several megakaryocytes but hypoplastic granulopoiesis in blocked maturation, without blasts. Computed-tomography (CT) scans of the thorax and abdomen were normal. Once urine and blood samples had been collected, empirical ceftazidime and gentamicin were begun, and achieved apyrexia within 48 h. After 46 h, blood cultures came back positive for Campylobacter jejuni, and the identical strain isolated from the patient's feces; amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1 g 3 times a day for 2 weeks) was prescribed. Seven days postadmission, CRP, neutrophil and platelet levels returned to normal (3 mg/L, 6.61 x 109/L and 521 x 109/L, respectively); blood cultures were negative; and liver function was improved.\\nLaboratory evaluation for immunodeficiency yielded: negative serology for human immunodeficiency viruses-1 and -2, very low serum Ig levels (Table 1) and no circulating B cells. Flow-cytometry quantification of T-cell subsets found expansion of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes expressing surface DR, suggesting their activation; low natural killer cells and CD8+ T-lymphocyte levels. Urine immunofixation electrophoresis was negative. Ig-replacement therapy was started but not pursued by the patient.\\nTen months later (May 2016, age 25) she was hospitalized for a 15-day low-grade fever, weight loss, nonproductive cough and progressive dyspnea. CRP, lactate dehydrogenase and beta2-microglobulin levels were 40 mg/L, 340 U/L (NR 5-240 U/L) and 3.53 mg/L (NR 1.2-2.5 mg/L), respectively. As shown in Table 1, hypogammaglobulinemia, CD19+ B lymphopenia and low peripheral CD8+ T-cell count persisted but without T activation, as assessed by HLADR-positivity. CT scans visualized bilateral diffuse infiltrates, ground-glass opacities and large nodules. Bronchoalveolar lavage analysis revealed Pneumocystis jiroveci cysts with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (4,000 copies/mL); high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids were prescribed. Searches for other pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, Cryptococcus and Aspergillus species, were negative. At that time, her bone-marrow biopsy was normal.\\nDespite appropriate antibiotics and clinical improvement, thoracic CT scans revealed worsened dense infiltrates (Figure 1(a)), pleural effusions, hepatosplenomegaly and nodular lesions of both kidneys (Figure 1(b)). A new bronchoscopy with biopsies found CD20+ large lymphomatous cell infiltration (Figure 2) in bronchi. Those large atypical lymphoid tumor cells were CD10-BCL-6- and MUM1+BCL-2+, with an 80% Ki-67-proliferation index on immunolabeling. EBV, as assessed by in situ hybridization with an EBV-encoded small RNA probe, was diffusely positive in about 80% of tumor cells (Figure 2). The FISH assay for MYC gene rearrangement (MYC FISH DNA Probe, Split Signal, (Y5410), Dako, Locus 8q24) was negative. EBV-positive DLBCL with a nongerminal center phenotype was diagnosed without bone-marrow infiltration. Circulating EBV-DNA was positive (2,430,000 IU/mL). DLBCL treatment consisted of RTX, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Even with EB viremia becoming negative, she developed fever, cytopenias, liver damage and neurological manifestations, as a consequence of her prominent bone-marrow hemophagocytosis. Unfortunately, she died of multiorgan failure at age 25.\",\n",

The patient's blood pressure was 155/115 mmHg, heart rate was 75 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.4 C. The patient had marked tachypnoea, oxygen saturation was 94% at room air. According to the patient's report, she had regular bowel habits and denied any vomitus, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation. There was no history of previous trauma and no surgical history. Clinical examination revealed a soft abdomen with some slight tenderness and markedly lowered breath sounds over the right lung. Laboratory findings revealed elevated white blood cells (11.14G/L, reference: 3.50-9.80G/L) with negative C-reactive protein. Ultrasound of the abdomen was negative for bilious attack or appendicitis. Pleural ultrasound described pleuritic alterations suggestive of pulmonary infarction. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was added and showed a right-sided Bochdalek hernia with right-sided lung compression, pleural effusion on the right, and mediastinal shift to the left (Figures 1A,B). First, all available findings and the critical situation were discussed with the anxious patient. Imaging results were used to explain the necessary surgical procedure. The patient had sufficient time to ask all relevant questions. Finally, she felt well informed and agreed to the surgical intervention due to lacking alternatives. An emergency median laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia in supine position. A 2 cm right posterolateral diaphragmatic hernial orifice containing an incarcerated and partially necrotic loop of the ascending colon without any intraabdominal signs of infection was detected (Figure 1C). The hernia content was reduced and fecal pleural fluid drained into the abdominal cavity from the chest. Multiple intraabdominal and right-sided thoracic lavages through the hernia defect were performed and the hernial orifice was closed with a non-absorbable 2-0 continuous suture. Right-sided hemicolectomy and a side-to-side anastomosis from the ileum to the transverse colon was necessary due to intestinal ischemia and colon perforation (Figure 1D). A right-sided 24 charierre chest tube was placed and antibiotic treatment with meropenem was started. Histopathological work-up revealed ischemic colon perforation with severe hemorrhagic peritonitis. Initially, the chest tube drained fecal fluid. Drainage reduced over time and the chest tube was removed on the fourth post-operative day. Post-operative pain improved under combined intense intravenous and oral pain medication, which allowed stepwise mobilization.\\nThe further post-operative course was complicated by a right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed, but only a small amount of purulent effusion could be evacuated. Pigtail catheter insertion remained unsuccessful. A thoracic CT scan was added and revealed a pleural effusion rim enhancement with distributed gas suspicious of infected effusion. A 24 charriere chest tube was inserted, which was complicated by multiple pleural adhesions. The chest tube was removed four days later after drainage reduced significantly. As laboratory infection signs remained elevated and the patient became febrile a further thoracic CT scan was performed, which showed increasing rim enhancement now suspicious of pleural empyema (Figures 2A,B). The actual situation was discussed in detail with the patient. Initially, she did not understand why a second surgical intervention was necessary. Once again imaging was presented. The patient gave consent for thoracic surgical intervention on the 13th post-operative day. For explorative video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) the patient was intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube for single lung ventilation and placed in the left lateral decubitus position. A mini thoracotomy was performed at the sixth intercostal space. Due to solid pleuritic formations this approach had to be converted to open thoracotomy following empyema (stage II-III) evacuation (Figures 2C,D) and right-sided pleural decortication. After extensive intrathoracic lavages a 24 charriere right-sided chest tube was placed apical-dorsal and another chest tube in the costodiaphragmatic recess. Antibiotic treatment was switched to levofloxacin and linezolid. The further post-operative course was uneventful and the chest tubes were removed on the fifth and seventh post-operative day, respectively. The early post-operative chest X-ray revealed a small residual right-sided pleural effusion and opacity due to basal hypoventilation accompanied by a moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. No signs of residual empyema or hernia recurrence were detected (Figures 3A,B).\\nThe patient was discharged in a stable condition one month after admission. Follow-up clinical examination and chest X-ray one year after initial surgical repair of right-sided Bochdalek hernia did not show any signs of recurrence and only slight right-basal hypoventilation (Figures 3C,D). The summary of the preoperative workup, hospitalization, and follow-up is shown in Figure 4.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'An active 34-year-old male presented with bilateral symptomatic medial OCD lesions. Body-mass index was 30 kg/m2 with genu varum, no muscular atrophy, and mild effusions bilaterally. Range of motion (ROM) was 0  of hyperextension, 0  extension, and 135  flexion bilaterally. Menisci and ligamentous examinations were normal, with medial femoral condyle pain on palpation in the right greater than the left knee. Preoperative radiographs demonstrated underlying genu varum with large medial femoral OCD lesions and a right knee Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 and left knee KL grade 1 (Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c)).\\nHip-to-ankle radiographs demonstrated femoral-tibial angles of 8  on the right and 3  on the left (Figure 3(a)). There was no patellofemoral involvement on Merchant\\'s views (Figure 3(b)).\\nNo preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was available due to work-related issues and timing. The patient decided to proceed with diagnostic arthroscopy and if indicated, planned biopsy from the intercondylar notch. At arthroscopy, a loose body was removed from the lateral compartment (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).\\nA large, irregular OCD lesion with a femoral chondral fragment with necrotic bone and medial tibial wear was seen in the medial compartment (Figures 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), and 5(d)).\\nAn unstable irreparable osteochondral fragment was removed, and pathology assessment revealed a cartilaginous fragment with osteonecrotic bone base (2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm). Intra-operative measurements demonstrated a lesion size of 3.0 x 4.5 cm with a bony depth of 2 cm. A cartilage biopsy from the right knee intercondylar notch was obtained (Figures 6(a), 6(b), 6(c), and 6(d)), and due to the large defect size, two MACI membranes were automatically ordered.\\nBased on the preoperative work-up, diagnostic arthroscopy, bony depth, and lesion size, the decision was made to proceed with right knee MACI \"Sandwich\" technique with concomitant HTO followed by left knee surgery, allowing adequate time for recovery.\\nA 6 cm anteromedial subvastus approach and HTO with 10  correction were performed (Figures 7(a), 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), and 8(a)).\\nA large, poorly contained lesion measuring 3 x 4.5 cm was demonstrated (Figure 8(b)). The periphery of the lesion was demarcated with a # 15 blade, and ringed curettes were used to remove damaged cartilage to normal vertical borders. A shelf was created between normal subchondral bone plate level and bone defect. Sclerotic bone and intralesional osteophytes were removed with a high-speed burr creating a healthy bleeding base (Figure 8(c)). The site was drilled with a 1.5 mm drill bit at 3 mm increments to increase blood flow into the lesion (Figure 8(d)).\\nIliac crest ABG was obtained, and bone impacted into the defect up to, but not above, the subchondral bone plate level demarcated by the previously created shelf (Figure 9(a)). Three absorbable micro-anchors were placed along the poorly contained region of the intercondylar notch. A Keith needle was used to create osseous tunnels incrementally along the medial border of the lesion. The lesion required the entire MACI graft. Fibrin sealant was placed over the base of the lesion (Figure 9(b)). The first graft was placed smooth-side facing towards the bone graft and sewn into position using the micro-anchors along the intercondylar notch region (Figure 9(c)); additional 5-0 vicryl sutures were placed using the osseous tunnels previously created with the Keith needle, and 6-0 vicryl sutures were placed proximally and distally at the normal articular cartilage margins (Figure 9(d)).\\nThe second graft was placed with the cell layer facing into the defect and sewn into position using the same sutures (Figures 10(a), 10(b), and 10(c)). Fibrin sealant was placed around the periphery of the lesion (Figure 10(d)). Standard closure was performed.\\nContinuous passive motion (CPM) machine with ROM to 30  flexion increasing by 15  per week was started on post-operative day (POD) # 1 with full active-assisted ROM initiated and CPM machine discontinued at 4 weeks; full ROM and immobilization were discontinued at 6 weeks. Toe-touch weight-bearing was allowed locked in extension on POD # 1, 25% partial weight-bearing (PWB) at 2 weeks, 25-50% PWB at 4 weeks, and full weight-bearing as tolerated at 6 weeks. Exercycle, elliptical, and core muscle strength programs were initiated at 6-8 weeks.\\nPost-operative radiographs at 3 (Figures 11(a) and 11(b)) and 6 months (Figures 12(a) and 12(b)) revealed improved medial joint space, appropriate contour, fill, and bone incorporation.\\nAll patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) significantly improved from baseline at 13 months. Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores improved by 37 and 54 points, respectively (Figure 13(a)). Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain and symptom scores improved 47 and 35 points, respectively, while KOOS sports improved by 75 points and quality of life increased by 81 points at the 13-month follow-up (Figure 13(b)). The PROMs delta augmentation prevails over the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).\\nLeft knee pain improved as right knee pain improved (Figure 14).\\nThe left knee PROMs stabilized (Figures 15(a) and 15(b)) and PSF-12 measurements improved by 21 points at 9 months (Figure 16).',\n",

She has a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism as well as a recent diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. She is a chronic smoker with a 30-pack-year history. Routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) reported a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%-64% and a calcified aortic valve with a mean gradient (MG) of 40 mmHg and an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2. Virtual basal ring sizing showed a perimeter of 70.2 mm2 with an area of 378.4 mm2 and a sinutubular junction of 24.6 mm. Pre-procedural cardiac catheterization showed non-obstructive coronary artery disease (Figure 1A). Further assessment with computed tomographic (CT) angiography demonstrated atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic root, thoracic aorta, and coronary arteries and an incidental kidney tumor. Consequently, the heart team opted for TAVI given her need to undergo an urgent nephrectomy for her urothelial carcinoma.\\nA 25 mm Navitor valve was successfully deployed under local anesthesia with procedural coronary angiography showing no evidence of obstructive CAD. She had a transient third-degree atrioventricular block that resolved on the table with a normal ECG when she arrived at the cardiac care unit next day. TTE showed an MG 18 mmHg and trivial paravalvular leak. The patient was discharged home one day post-TAVI with a single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), 100 mg of aspirin daily.\\nShe was doing well until 10 days after the procedure when she presented with acute severe chest pain (Figure 2). Immediate ECG showed evidence of inferior myocardial infarction (MI) with ST elevations in leads II and III and ventricular fibrillation (aVF). High sensitivity troponin level was elevated reaching 50,000 pg/ml. She also had an elevated c-reactive protein and white blood count; however, she did not have any fever or positional chest pain. Her blood pressure was 120/60 mmHg. TTE showed evidence of inferior wall hypokinesis. Emergent coronary angiography revealed a thrombus occluding the second segment of the right coronary artery (RCA) (Figure 1B). Angioplasty was performed with implantation of one drug-eluting stent (Figure 1C). The patient's symptoms, ECG changes, and troponin elevations provided evidence in favor of MI instead of other differentials such as pericarditis or aortic dissection following the procedure. She was stabilized and discharged on 75 mg of clopidogrel, 100 mg of aspirin, 5 mg of amlodipine twice daily, and 2.5 mg of bisoprolol twice daily.\\nThe etiology of the MI was investigated with a follow-up CT angiography given that the patient did not have evidence of CAD before the procedure. The CT showed a small thrombus between the right coronary and left coronary cusp (Figure 3). The patient was then put on for two weeks on triple therapy: 100 mg of aspirin, 75 mg of clopidogrel, and 15 mg rivaroxaban. This was followed by clopidogrel and rivaroxaban for six weeks. There were no further cardiac or embolic clinical presentations, and the patient was cleared for her nephrectomy.\",\n",

This symptomatology got complicated by sphincter disorders characterized by urinary incontinence and constipation. The clinical examination objectified incomplete paraplegia without sensory loss. Patellar and Achilles reflexes were reduced on both the lower limbs. MRI showed an intradural fusiform lesion at L3-L4, with an isosignal on T1 and T2, associated with a central nodular hypersignal on both sequences. The lesion took up the whole spinal canal, making a scallop shape on the vertebral body and laminating its posterior arch. The tumor homogenously enhanced following a gadolinium injection [Figure 1]. The diagnosis for neurinoma was highly suspected. Through an L3 and L4 laminectomy and an opening of the dura mater, the tumor appeared to be grayish red, closed, very hemorrhagic, and tied to the filum terminale. The lesion retracted nerve roots on the back and on the left side without any invasion. The tumor was attached to the filum terminal and his section has facilitated total removal. The patient fully recovered her motor function after a sphincter and motor function rehabilitation. Macroscopically, the anatomopathological examination showed an encapsulated proliferative tumor, lobulated and surrounded by tiny fiber tracts. It was vascularized with large plaques of hemorrhagic suffusion. Microscopically, we showed lobulated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasms, sharply demarcated, with dense and rounded nuclei, pointing in immunohistochemistry neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (CgA) [Figure 2].',\n",

Due to progressive heart failure, the pacemaker was upgraded in 2004 to an ICD with cardiac resynchronization therapy (Guidant Contak Renewal M179, CRT-D). For this purpose a Guidant 0138 ICD shock lead was implanted in the right ventricle and a Medtronic Attain 4194 in a posterolateral branch of the coronary sinus for left ventricular pacing. The preexisting Medtronic 4524 atrial lead was used for atrial pacing and sensing, and the bipolar right ventricular lead was abandoned. \\nA hospital admission because of ventricular tachycardias showed successful termination of these tachycardias by ICD shock therapy. Except shock therapy, the patient complained of dizzy spells, which at that time were attributed only to the ventricular tachycardias. However, at the time of device interrogation, the ECG showed intermittent ventricular inhibition.  Figure 1 demonstrates intermittent ventricular sensing followed by inhibition after atrial pacing. The interval between atrial pacing and ventricular sensing was estimated from 60 to 70 ms in this recording. Practically sensing is anticipated immediately after time out of the ventricular blanking period, which was programmed at 65 ms. \\nInhibition did not occur during atrial sensing, which is a strong indicator of cross-talk sensing. A Holter recording performed 24 hours prior to the device checkup revealed several periods of asystole with duration up to 7.4 seconds as a consequence of cross-talk sensing (Figure 2). The chest X-ray showed normal lead positions; there was no evidence of lead damage which was confirmed by unchanged values of lead impedances.\\nThe pacing parameters were DDD 65 till 110 beats/min and dynamic AV delay 160 ms/100 ms pacing output in atrial and RV 2.6 V at 0.06 ms, and LV 3.0 V at 0.5 ms, the RV-blank after A-pace was 65 ms, and the RV sensitivity was set to nominal.\\nNeither prolongation of the ventricular blanking period to 85 ms nor decreasing atrial output to 1.0 V at 0.5 ms could eliminate cross-talk sensing. Finally, cross-talk sensing disappeared after programming right-ventricular sensitivity from nominal to the least sensitive setting (Figure 3). Proper sensing during intrinsic rhythm and ventricular fibrillation during DFT testing was confirmed at this sensitivity setting.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 9-year-old girl was admitted to Dongguan Children's Hospital 6 months ago due to breast development. Since the patient had no other obvious symptoms, we did some laboratory tests to help diagnose. A gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test showed that the peak values of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were 8.03 and 14.97 IU/L, with an LH/FSH ratio of 0.53. Based on her premature breast development, test results and the absence of relevant personal or family history, she was diagnosed with precocious puberty and treatment with a monthly intramuscular injection of triptorelin (decapeptyl) was initiated. The patient also received imaging examinations to exclude underlying diseases. Unexpectedly, ultrasonography indicated a single, solid, focal liver lesion in S5. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed hyperenhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase, which was 17mm x 18mm in size, with a hypodense central stellate scar visible inside the region (Figure 1A). The lesion became isodense in portal venous and delayed phases, and the stellate scar showed slight enhancement. A diagnosis of FNH was considered. CT re-examination 6 months later showed that the lesion had increased to 23mm x 19mm x 18mm in size. According to ultrasound, the lesion was non-homogeneous, slightly hyperechoic with an unclear boundary, and located 1mm away from the gallbladder and 3mm away from the colon. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed spoke-wheel blood flow, with the feeding artery being from the S5 hepatic artery branch (Figure 1B). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) indicated a radiant artery and hyperenhancement of the lesion, which was 29mm x 25mm in size, in the arterial phase (Figure 1C), portal phase and delayed phase.\\nAn APLIO I700 ultrasound system with a PVT-674BT 10C3 abdominal probe (Canon, Japan, 2020), incisive CT (PHILIPS, 2020), and definition flash CT (SOMATOM, 2017) were used for diagnosis. A 100A1 microwave generator (2,450 MHz) and an ECO-100CI10 MWA antenna (Yigao, Nanjing, China) were employed for MWA. SonoVue (Bracco, Italy) was utilized as the contrast agent for ultrasound and was prepared as a suspension with 5 ml of 0.9% normal saline (N.S.). For transvenous use of the contrast agent, 1 ml of SonoVue was injected through a central venous catheter, followed by 5 ml of N.S. For intracavitary use, the ratio of N.S. and SonoVue was 100:1. A coaxial needle (15 G) and an automatic biopsy gun (18 G, BARD, USA) were applied for biopsy and a central venous catheterization set (Arrow, USA) was used for abdominal cavity intubation.\\nArtificial ascites-assisted ultrasound-guided MWA and biopsy were carried out under general endotracheal anesthesia. Under ultrasound guidance, we performed abdominal cavity intubation, and SonoVue in N.S. at 40 C was infused into the abdominal cavity. Under CEUS, we observed hyperechoic contrast agent distribution between the gallbladder and the hepatic margin close to the lesion, indicating that this fluid could provide a cooling effect during thermal ablation (Figure 2). We also inserted a guide wire near the position of the gallbladder and then inserted an expansion tube, which were used together to push the gallbladder wall away to avoid thermal injury.\\nUnder color Doppler ultrasound guidance, the microwave antenna was inserted directly to the site of the feeding artery (Figure 3A), and after 2 min of ablation at 60 W, CEUS showed no blood flow perfusion in the tumor (Figure 3B). Three biopsy specimens were then collected using a coaxial needle and an automatic biopsy gun. The microwave antenna was inserted through the coaxial needle to ablate the biopsy needle track after ablating the lesion. After biopsy, the tumor border near the gallbladder was ablated, followed by the peripheral part of the tumor and, finally, the interior of the tumor. After ablation, complete ablation of the whole lesion was observed by CEUS. Additionally, the gallbladder wall showed blood perfusion, indicating that the thermal ablation procedure did not cause necrosis in the gallbladder wall (Figure 4A). Moreover, the contrast agent did not enter the ascites, which indicated no needle track bleeding.\\nPost-operative medications included cefixime granules as an anti-inflammatory agent and compound glycyrrhizin capsules to protect liver function. The abdominal drainage tube was removed on the second day after the operation, and the patient was discharged on the sixth day. Examination by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 month later showed that the tumor was completely ablated and that the gallbladder was not injured (Figure 4B). Based on ultrasonography after another 3 months, there were no significant changes in the ablation zone and no blood flow signal inside it. Additionally, the gallbladder exhibited no obvious abnormity.\",\n",

The median of sample size of these seven case series studies was 33, ranging from 19 to 242. The mean/median maternal ages were basically the same (about 28 years old, respectively), ranging from 16 to 50 years. Pregnant women presented symptoms across all the trimesters, the proportion of pregnant women with brucellosis presented symptoms at the first trimester ranged from 12.9% to 57.9%, while it ranged from 22.2% to 51.6% at the second trimester. The most commonly used laboratory tests for brucellosis were serum agglutination test (SAT) and blood/bone marrow culture, which were used in 85.7% and 71.4% studies among the case series, respectively, and 66.7% and 45.5% cases were diagnosed with brucellosis using SAT and blood/bone marrow culture respectively among the case reports. The incidence of brucellosis occurred in pregnant women ranged from 1.5% to 5.8%. As for the adverse obstetric outcomes, the rate of abortion ranged from 2.5% to 53.0%, the rate of preterm delivery ranged from 3.4% to 31.3% and the IUFD rate ranged from 2.1% to 9.8%.  \\nMost pregnant women with brucellosis had a history of consumption of cheese or non-pasteurized dairy products (92.3% in the study by Kurdoglu et al and 90.8% in the study by Vilchez et al) or living in a low socioeconomic class or rural areas. There were no neonates infected with brucellosis in the included case series study in Turkey, while the rate of congenital brucellosis was 6.4% in the included case series study in Peru.

The patient had begun complaining of progressive fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and back pain beginning approximately one year before diagnosis at his primary care provider's office, which initially seemed to be associated with his, at the time, recent parathyroid resection. Lyme's disease, endemic in the patient's geographic region and often considered in nonspecific presentations with these symptoms, was ruled out by antibody assay. On retrospective analysis of the patient's history, he apparently had worked at a local university in maintenance and did not have a known history of employment in manufacturing or significant chemical handling. There was no known family history of genetic conditions that would predispose the patient to multiple malignancies.\\nThe patient progressively worsened over months; he developed nausea, dry heaving, and decreased appetite. CT of the chest and HIDA scan had been performed which revealed nonobstructive cholelithiasis with normal gallbladder function. The patient subsequently underwent a noncontrast CT of abdomen and pelvis, which revealed a large abdominal mass measuring 7 cm x 5.5 cm abutting the mid portion of the transverse colon, with numerous metastatic foci in the liver, lymphadenopathy adjacent to the pancreatic head, a large lytic lesion involving the tenth rib, and scattered lytic areas throughout the spine and left iliac wing (Figure 1). The patient then underwent core biopsy of the abdominal mass.\\nInitial core biopsy of the abdominal mass revealed highly vascular tissue, the majority necrotic, with small atypical cells seen on frozen section. Immunohistochemical staining for RCC was negative. CD10 was equivocal with chromogranin A and podoplanin (D240) both being negative. Vimentin was strongly positive. A consult was made, an additional staining including Cam 5.2, CD31, and ERG. Cam 5.2 revealed rare mesothelial cells and the vascular proliferation was positive for both CD31 and ERG. It was concluded that the degree of necrosis precluded a definitive diagnosis but that a vascular neoplasm or well-differentiated angiosarcoma could not be excluded.\\nRepeat core liver biopsy and immunohistochemical staining were performed at an outside institution. The liver biopsy delineated a very hypercellular specimen (Figure 2(a)). The tumor was comprised of a prominent vasoformative network (Figure 2(b)). The endothelial lining cells were plump and pleomorphic. They had high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with hobnailing hyperchromatic nuclei. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic with indistinct cell borders. The cytology delineated a hypercellular aspirate (Figure 3). The cells formed a tightly cohesive cluster of epithelioid cells. The cells harbored hyperchromatic nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm. On occasion, the cytoplasm demonstrated cytoplasmic vacuoles and intracytoplasmic lumina. Focally, the clusters were composed of very atypical spindle cells. The cytology specimen stained negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and positivity for CD31 and CD34. Since the specimen stained for two vascular immunohistochemical stains (CD31 and CD34) in conjunction with pancytokeratin negativity, a diagnosis of angiosarcoma was rendered (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)).\\nThe patient was scheduled for systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin as well as palliative, single modality radiation therapy of the spine. Radiation was completed first. The patient's chemotherapy regimen was changed to taxol rather than doxorubicin due to low ejection fraction seen on MUGA scan. However, prior to initiation of chemotherapy the patient was hospitalized for confusion, lethargy, and enterococcal bacteremia. The decision was made to discharge the patient with hospice care and he died 13 days later.\",\n",

In order to differentially diagnose cardiogenic edema, we perfected the cardiac color Doppler ultrasound. The infant's parents refused to permit cholangiography and a liver biopsy. Due to the unclear diagnosis, we performed a genetic test. The infant's genetic analysis showed a CFTR hemizygous mutation site (c.223C>T) in exon 3 and exon 2-3 heterozygous deletion mutation. A genetic verification of the infant's parents was also performed; the father had a point mutation and the mother had a CFTR gene exon 2-3 heterozygous deletion mutation (shown in Figure 1). To further verify whether the child had pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, we tested fecal pancreas elastase 1 and the result was 0.6 mug/g, significantly lower than the normal value of 200 mug/g. Stool testing showed fat globules of 70-80/HP. These findings, combined with the manifestations of cholestasis, supported the diagnosis of CF. Because our hospitals and other testing institutions cannot perform a sweat chloride test, we did not perform it.\\nAfter hospital admission, the infant was placed on a lactose-free fortified medium-chain fatty acid milk powder feeding, oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 30 mg/(kg.d), and supplemented with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The stool color remained unchanged. Fecal pancreas elastase 1 suggested that the child had insufficient pancreatic exocrine function, so aspergillus oryzae pancreatic enzymes tablets (half a tablet once, three times per day) were added 2 weeks after diagnosis. Two weeks after the oral pancreatic enzyme tablets were administered, the color of the infant's stool changed to yellow and his weight increased (shown in Figure 2).\",\n",

Diana reached the Centre with a BMI of 16.06 kg/m2 reporting several disruptions in her eating patterns and several distressful alterations in her body image perception. As reported in the clinical history, Diana's first eating related crisis was dated back 2 years before her current admission, with a subtle episode when she started a diet to lose some weight after health issues related to her thyroid. During that period, Diana was located abroad for work and - under moderate stress - she began a restrictive diet with a low caloric intake that brought her to lose 10 kg in 6 months. Diana's weight remained constant in the following months but she developed an obsessive attention to the caloric intake along with intrusive thoughts regarding her weight and regarding specific types of foods. Diana also reported body-related image distortions such as overvaluation of her weight, mirror and body checking, and avoidance of body exposure. Moreover, during the crises, she reported frequent crying spells observing her body in front of a mirror.\\nIn the last year, Diana reported a stressful situation at the University that heightened her psychological symptoms. Following these new difficulties, Diana re-enacted the restrictive conducts, reducing the caloric intake with a consequent weight loss of 4 kg in a month. In the period before the admission, the restrictive conduits were accompanied by self-induced vomit and daily binge episodes.\\nDiana matched all the DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of AN, binge-purge subtype. Compatible with the diagnosis, Diana presented distortions in her body perception and obsessive thoughts regarding her weight and her body image; for these reasons, she was considered as an optimal candidate for the interoceptive assessment.\\nAt the begin of the rehabilitative protocol, Diana's blood panels showed no signs of metabolic distress, with values in normal ranges. At her admission, Diana's thyroid levels were within normal range and they remained within the normal range during the curse of the treatment. Endocrinologist suggested a chronic autoimmune normal-functioning condition. The psychiatric assessment indicated mood alterations toward a depressive condition accompanied by severe sleep difficulties and insomnia.\\nThe rehabilitative program was composed of a multidisciplinary approach that included several experts in different fields: endocrinology, psychiatry, psychology, and nutrition. The specialists collaborated in an outpatients service tailored to the specific users' needs. The rehabilitative program could extend from two to four cycles of treatment. Diana followed a two-cycle rehabilitative protocol with a frequency of 3 sessions a week for a total of 37 sessions. The protocol was composed of psychological intervention with group psychotherapy and individual sessions focused upon a psyco-corporal therapy approach (body-oriented psychotherapy). Psychological intervention was accompanied by psychiatric and pharmacological support (citalopram and mirtazapine), to moderate Diana's mood alterations. The rehabilitative protocol was integrated with alimentary education sessions provided by the nutritionist. Additionally, the protocol was also accompanied by a nutritional program with fixed meals (both in quantity and composition) that Diana consumed under supervision. Scheduled assessment sessions ensured an adequate monitoring of the progress.\\nFrom the beginning, Diana showed a deep insight regarding her condition. Nonetheless, from her first session, Diana showed severe difficulties in following the assigned rehabilitative diet due to obsessive thoughts connected to her body weight and to certain types of food. In the following weeks, Diana improved her adherence to the recovery protocol with a better ability to follow the changes in the diet both on quantitative both on the qualitative level (e.g., types of foods consumed). Diana reached a BMI of 19.00 kg/m2 at the end of her second cycle of rehabilitative treatment. Considering the noticeable improvements regarding her eating behaviors and her general clinical condition, Diana was dismissed from the Centre and continued her program following only monthly assessments accompanied by individual psychotherapy.\",\n",

Subsequently, a CT scan of the paranasal sinus, neck, and thorax revealed a mass over left frontal and ethmoid sinuses which occupied almost the entire left nasal cavity. Incidentally, there was a well-defined heterogeneously enhancing mass at the left paravertebral region (7.1 x 7.8 x 7.8 cm) with extension into left T7/8 neural foramina (Figure 1).

Nasopharyngeal mass biopsy was performed, and histological examination highlighted diffuse infiltration by the atypical medium to large lymphoid cells and exhibited multiple membrane bound nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that the neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for CD79a, MUM-1, and CD56 and focally positive for PAX-5 (Figure 2).

As a result of a thick transverse vaginal septum blocking her vaginal cavity, we could insert a speculum only 2 to 3 cm into her vagina (Fig. 1A). Transvaginal ultrasonography (Voluson 730 Expert, GE Medical Systems, Zipf, Austria) showed a transverse vaginal septum measuring 0.94 cm thick and a fluid-filled cavity beyond it (Fig. 1B). Vaginal adhesion was diagnosed and she was admitted for treatment of this rare condition.\\nAfter hospitalization, prophylactic intravenous antibiotics (3rd-generation cephalosporin with metronidazole) were administered first. After the day of admission, the fluid in the obstructed vaginal cavity was aspirated and examined. This fluid was turbid and had a foul odor but no bacteria were found upon culture examination. With this aspiration, we excised the vaginal septum and sutured the remained edge of this septum to the vaginal wall using 2-0 Vicryl (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) (Fig. 2). After the operation, we inserted Vaseline gauze into the vaginal cavity to prevent re-adhesion and hemorrhage. This packed gauze was maintained during the whole hospitalization period and changed every day. Antibiotics were administered intravenously for 5 days and she was discharged on day 5 after the operation. Three months following surgery, she noticed an improvement in her dyspareunia and resumed sexual activity. Pelvic examination revealed a well-maintained vaginal cavity.',\n",

Spinal cord exhibited intense, relatively homogenous enhancement after intravenous gadolinium injection (Figure 2). Subsequent spinal computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed with a 16-slice scanner (Philips Brilliance 16, Philips Medical Systems) with nonionic iodinated contrast agent (Iohexol, 350 mg/mL) at dose of 2 mL/kg injected into the antecubital vein through pressure injector at a rate of 4 mL/sec with bolus tracking, with ROI placed over the abdominal aorta (scanning parameters: increment 1.0 mm, reconstruction interval 0.75 mm, slice thickness 2.0 mm, pitch 1.188, rotation time 0.75s, kVp 120, mA 200) CTA revealed an intradural extramedullary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) from Th10 to Th12 level (Figure 3) supplied by a branch of a great radicular artery (artery of Adamkiewicz).

At 1 year of age, he presented with daily obstructive symptoms of distention and bloating. He suffered from three episodes of enterocolitis, each requiring hospital admission. At an outside hospital, he underwent an examination under anesthesia and a full thickness rectal biopsy with findings of an intact dentate line, no anastomotic stricture, and a palpable Soave cuff on the anterior rectal wall only. His rectal biopsy showed ganglion cells, normal size nerve fibers, normal anticholinesterase reaction, a normal calretinin staining pattern, and his contrast study was felt to be normal. The patient also underwent colonic manometry testing which showed diffuse colonic dysmotility. Based on this result, an ileostomy was recommended.\\nThereafter, the patient thrived. The patient then returned for a planned repeat manometry study 6 months later which now showed normal motility, and the recommendation was to close the ileostomy. Prior to closing the ileostomy, the family sought a second opinion.\\n Our review of the post pull-through contrast enema ( Fig. 1 ) came to a different conclusion. We felt the study showed a 180-degree twist in the distal pull-through ( Fig. 1 ). This was demonstrated by the shift in the antimesenteric border of the colon. We also felt that the twist was intermittent since the contrast study did not demonstrate bowel dilatation proximal to the twist. Since this patient had a previous Soave pull-through, it was also important to note the presence of presacral space widening ( Fig. 2 ), which could be indicative of a Soave cuff; however, this was not evident on the physical exam. Our repeat examination under anesthesia and rectal biopsy confirmed the findings from the outside hospital of no circumferential Soave cuff; however, we were unable to pass a digit or a Foley catheter freely into the pelvis. Given the recurrent obstructive symptoms that occurred prior to the ileostomy and the concerns on the contrast study and exam, we offered the patient a reoperation. We performed a Swenson type redo transanal only pull-through and upon transanal mobilization the distal pull-through was noted to have a 180-degree twist, with the mesentery on the anterior side when it should have been either medial or posterior ( Fig. 3 ). We untwisted the pull-through and redid the coloanal anastomosis and confirmed no twist by freely passing the foley catheter into the pelvis. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home on postoperative day 4. He was seen for a follow-up at 1 month, which showed a well-healed pull-through with no anastomotic stricture and his ileostomy was closed.

Throughout his early childhood he continued to develop recurrent skin and soft tissue infections almost monthly and usually without fevers, including at 4 years of age when he had another I&D of a facial abscess with cultures growing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. At age 5 he was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia complicated by a parapneumonic effusion and multiple cavitary lung lesions (Figure 1). He was treated with drainage of the lung nodules and prolonged iv antibiotics.\\nGiven his recurrent infections at an early age of onset requiring repeated hospitalizations and iv treatments, the immunology service was consulted. The patient had several immune evaluations at age 2 and 4 that were normal and included immunoglobulin levels with undetectable IgE and normal lymphocyte subsets, CD11 and CD18 expression, nitroblue tetrazolium testing and myeloperoxidase staining.\\nAt 7 years of age, the patient was admitted to the hospital with superinfection of his eczema lesions and his IgE was then found to be elevated at 4,409 kU/L (normal 0-63 kU/L). Given his history of recurrent staphylococcal infections and elevated IgE, AD-HIES was suspected. A de novo, heterozygous missense mutation in STAT3 (c.1934T>A, p.L645Q) was detected (Figure 2A). This novel mutation is located in the SH2 domain, adjacent to amino acids previously reported to contain STAT3 mutations associated with AD-HIES. It is not reported in publically available databases.\\nThis mutation changes a polar glutamine for a non-polar leucine. Reduction of transcriptional activity of STAT3 p.L645Q to 85% of wild-type was confirmed using a luciferase assay (Figure 2B). The patient also had decreased CD3+CD4+ T cells expressing IL-17 (Figure 2C). Furthermore, STAT3 phosphorylation in patient-derived cells was impaired in response to cytokine stimulation (Figure 3), which has been reported in patients with AD-HIES and STAT3 mutations in the SH2 domain.\\nThe patient did not have a history of mucocutaneous candidiasis. He did have eosinophilia (10.7%, 560 cells/muL), a common finding in AD-HIES. His peak serum IgE has been 10,665 kU/L. At 14 years of age, the patient sustained a non-displaced fracture in his ankle following a ground level fall. Bone densitometry showed osteopenia. He did not manifest other non-immunologic features of AD-HIES such as coarse facies, high-arched palate, scoliosis or joint hyper-extensibility, although he was noted to have retained primary upper incisors. He did have two separate and resolving episodes of facial nerve palsy at age 5 and 15 years not clearly associated with a viral infection.\\nAfter the diagnosis of AD-HIES, the patient was started on prophylactic cephalexin but continued to struggle with recurrent abscesses. After his response to pneumococcal vaccination was judged insufficient, his prophylactic antibiotic was changed to levofloxacin and he was started on immunoglobulin replacement therapy. He has subsequently experienced a significant decrease in the frequency of his infections and improved quality of life.',\n",

The initial troponin I level was 0.12 [<0.5 ng/ml], but the follow-up troponin I was 0.51 [<0.5 ng/ml]. Initial ECG showed sinus rhythm, first-degree AV block, incomplete right bundle branch block, biphasic T-wave inversion in V2 and V3, and T-wave inversion in anterolateral leads.\\nIn the setting of the patient's clinical presentation associated with troponin leakage and ECG changes concerning for ischemia, he was started on full acute coronary syndrome (ACS) protocol including loading dose of aspirin, and clopidogrel, therapeutic anticoagulation, and statin therapy along with monitoring ECG changes and troponin I levels.\\nThe following day, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and the chest pain was resolved. However, the repeat troponin I level was 0.80 [<0.5 ng/ml], and follow-up ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 55 beats per min with first-degree A-V block, incomplete right bundle branch block, and biphasic T waves in V2 and V3 which in that clinical setting was consistent with Type-A T waves seen in Wellens syndrome (Fig. 1). An echocardiogram was also performed, and it revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50-55% and mildly hypokinetic changes on the apical septal and apical anterior segments.\\nThe patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory for left heart catheterization, coronary angiography, and left ventriculography. During the intervention, it was found that the LAD had a proximal to mid stent and a distal stent in place. There was proximal 90% in-stent restenosis at the proximal edge of the first stent. There was also a 90% in-stent restenosis at the proximal edge of the second stent into the mid-segment, which was a tubular lesion. Also, there was a distal 70% discrete stenosis in the distal LAD.\\nBecause of the above findings, a total of three stents were placed. The first stent was placed in the mid to distal LAD to cover the second 90% lesion. The second stent was placed to cover the proximal lesion and was placed at the proximal edge of the previous stent. A third stent was placed in the distal LAD at the level of the distal 70% discrete stenosis. The repeat angiographic shots showed excellent results with no residual angiographic stenosis and no dissection, perforation, or complications.\\nFurther recommendations included aggressive guideline-directed medical therapy for coronary artery disease, including dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for minimally one year, a beta-blocker, and a statin. Furthermore, the patient was counseled extensively on medication compliance after stent placement.\",\n",

As part of the trial protocol, we examined 521 stool samples from study participants for intestinal parasites, using the Kato-Katz method based on duplicate slides as per current WHO recommendation. The child with the stool sample harbouring H. nana eggs (Figure 1) was unique amongst the 72 children out of 340 (21%) in whom intestinal parasites were present. The child presented with an infection intensity of 144 eggs/gram of stool and was mildly anaemic, with an Hb value of 10.8 g/dl, and iron deficient, with ferritin of 12.9 microg/l. The child also had a high white blood cell count and high granulocyte count, indicative of infection (Table 1).

His symptoms started with a dry cough that progressed from blood-tinged sputum to frank blood over three weeks. He had associated fever, chills, night sweats and subjective weight loss. His previous symptoms had completely resolved and he moved to the United States from Nepal one year prior to the hospital admission.\\nOn physical examination, the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with a generalized cachectic appearance and diffuse rhonchi bilaterally on pulmonary auscultation. His labs were notable for a normal leukocyte count, a hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and normal chemistries. The chest x-ray, Fig. 1, had a lucency in the left suprahilar region and bilateral peribronchial thickening of the upper lobes. A follow up CT scan, Fig. 2, showed multiple cavitary lesions at the superior segment of the left lower lobe.\\nOn hospitalization day 2, a microscopic smear of his sputum showed many acid-fast bacilli that was later identify in cultures as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. He was started on a 5-drug regimen with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and moxifloxacin due to his prior history of possible resistant TB. He continued to have persistent hemoptysis and worsening anemia requiring a transfusion due tachycardia and dyspnea, suggesting massive hemoptysis. Four days after the anti-tuberculosis medication was initiated, he developed respiratory distress and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit and was placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation but did not improve. Thus, he underwent an urgent bronchoscopy, revealing a significant burden of blood clots in the left main bronchus that did not allow for a complete survey of the airway. As a result, an endobronchial blocker was placed and the patient was evaluated by interventional radiology. He underwent urgent left bronchial artery angiography with embolization of two abnormally hypertrophied left bronchial arteries.\\nThe following day, he underwent repeat bronchoscopy that showed persistent clot burden in the left main bronchus. Given his active tuberculosis, difficulty with oxygenation, and multiple cavitary lesions, the decision was made to proceed with left lower lobectomy. On gross examination, the lobe of lung was severely congested weighing 645 g (normal weight of a complete left lung: 395 g). There was widespread consolidation with nodules containing caseous material, Fig. 3A. It corresponded to necrotizing nonsuppurative granulomas with a peribronchial and subpleural distribution in a miliary pattern, Fig. 3B. The granulomatous inflammation extended around medium sized vessels causing destruction of the vasa vasorum and secondary obliterative endarteritis, Fig. 3C. Numerous cavities developed in relation to necrotizing granulomas with suppuration and hemorrhage, Fig. 3D. Round foreign particles were deposited in the arterial lumina, consistent with a prior embolization procedure. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage emerged after bleeding into the cavitating granulomas due to destruction of vessel walls, Fig. 3E and F. Few acid-fast organisms consistent with L-shaped mycobacteria were identified on FITE stain, Fig. 3G-I. Other special stains including Kinyoun cold procedure, auramine-rhodamine staining, and mycobacterium immunostaining, were negative for acid fast bacilli.\\nOn hospitalization day 6 the patient's family, who was previously unable to contacted, arrived at the hospital and the team was able to provide additional history regarding his previous TB therapy. He was diagnosed with multidrug resistant (MDR) TB seven years prior to admission and treated for 18 months with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, moxifloxacin and an injectable medication, the name of which they could not recall. The following day, the Health Department confirmed fluoroquinolone-resistant tuberculosis by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Rifampin, isoniazid, and moxifloxacin were discontinued and the patient was started on amikacin, linezolid, meropenem, clavulanate, para-aminosalicylic acid and ethionamide. Bedaquiline was requested from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). After his lobectomy, he required persistent intensive care unit monitoring because he would not tolerate extubation trials along with multiple episodes of mucous plugging, which required multiple bronchoalveolar lavages. He was successfully extubated on hospitalization day 14. The patient was transferred to the regional TB center of Florida on hospitalization day 21.\\nAfter an additional two months of being monitored and treated at the regional tuberculosis center, the patient was discharged to the community and continued his treatment under directly observed treatment through the department of health.\",\n",

We used 18-month-old BALB/cBy mice (obtained from the National Institute on Aging) orthotopically implanted with 4T1 breast cancer cells as a model to study the effect of exercise on stromal cell populations. The 4T1 breast cancer cell line in mice is highly invasive, with the ability to metastasize to lungs, brain, liver, bone, lymph nodes, and blood, similar to triple negative invasive breast cancer in women.\\nMice were randomly selected, with 15 mice in the running group. Runners were given access to free running wheels in individual cages as previously described. We monitored the running activity continuously for 60 days. 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), cultured under standard laboratory conditions, were injected at a concentration of 1x104 cells into the 4th mammary fat pad of each mouse. Mice were allowed to run another 30 days when the experiment ended. Running wheels (measuring 15.5 cm by diameter) transmitted electronic signals wirelessly to a monitoring hub (Med Associates ENV-044, Vermont) and raw data were exported to Microsoft Excel for processing. The distance ran by each mouse was calculated as (3.14x15.5 cmxnumber of revolutions)/(100 cm per mx1,000 m per km). Mice were housed in a standard rodent room within a specific pathogen-free (SPF) barrier facility with 12-hour light and dark cycles. Ambient temperature in the room was kept at 70-74 F. Mice were fed standard rodent chow (5,053; Picolab, Richmond, IN) and water ad libitum. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington, Seattle.\\nAt 30 days post-tumor cell injection, mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Carcasses and mammary tumors were weighed to obtain tumor burden, defined as tumor weight normalized to carcass weight. The breast tumor from each mouse was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described using paraffin-embedded tumor sections. Primary antibodies to specific markers were incubated at 1:50 for 1 hour. Sections were blocked in 15% goat/5% mouse serum. BGA rat secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) were used and incubated at 1:200 for 30 min and slides then counterstained with hematoxylin. Digital images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E400 bright field microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) attached with a Nikon Coolpix 995, digital camera (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan; 3.3 megapixels, resolution 2,048x1,536 pixels). Five random images at 60x magnification were captured per tumor sample under blinded conditions and saved in JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format. The number of labeled cells was also determined blindly and independently by two co-authors of this paper (CPB and WL) by counting positive cells in a grid of eight squares encompassing the entire plane of view at 20x magnification per slide using five random field views. The labeling index was calculated as the average percentage of stained cells relative to unstained cells. Student's t-test was used to detect significant differences between groups.\\nDuring the tumor progression phase of 4T1 breast cancer in old BALB/c mice, we observed significant differences in labeling for F4/80, a marker for mouse macrophages, and CD34, a marker for vascular endothelial cells, in primary tumors from mice that ran higher average distances compared to mice that ran lower average distances, p<=0.05, N=2, from four mice (Table 1). It can be seen that macrophages are much less frequent in a tumor from a long-distance runner (Fig. 1a) compared to a tumor from a short-distance runner (Fig. 1b). The decrease in CD34 labeling in a long-distance runner (Fig. 1c) compared to a short-distance runner (Fig. 1d) suggests that increased running distance was also associated with decreased vascularization. There were no significant correlations between running distance and labeling for cell proliferation (Ki-67) or apoptosis (Caspase 3) in primary tumors (Table 1), suggesting that exercise training might be targeting stromal cell populations. Even though pre-tumor running was associated with an anti-tumor effect in a distance dependent manner, no correlation was seen between tumor burden and running distance during the tumor progression period. It is possible that the rapid and aggressive tumor growth may have overwhelmed any anti-tumor effects by suppressed stromal cells. However, there were no significant correlations between distance ran before tumor injection and labeling for F4/80 and CD34 as well as for Ki67 and Caspase 3 in primary tumors collected at the termination of the study (data not shown) suggesting other unknown mechanisms are likely responsible for the antitumor effects of pre-tumor running.\\nThese observations suggest that immunohistochemistry can be used to monitor stromal cell populations in tumors from old mice under exercise conditions, and further support the concept of using old mice for modeling in preclinical cancer studies.\",\n",

The patient claimed to have no history of smoking, allergies or occupational exposure to noxious agents. Physical examination revealed coarse breathing sounds with inspiratory crackle extending over the whole of the both lung fields. However, the results of blood analysis were normal.\\nChest radiographs demonstrated the presence of bilateral, diffuse, reticulonodular densities in both lungs (Fig. 1A). Thin-section CT scan showed diffusely distributed mosaic pattern of inhomogeneous attenuation extending over the entirety of lung zones, without zonal predominance. There was no difference in the extent of mosaic attenuation between inspiratory (Fig. 1B) and expiratory thin-section CT scans (Fig. 1C). As compared with more highly attenuated areas of the lung, however, the caliber and number of pulmonary vessels in areas of the lower attenuation were reduced. There were several foci of bronchial wall thickening, and these were more frequently found in areas of lower attenuation. In the right lower paratracheal area and subcarinal area, the presence of several small lymph nodes less than 1 cm in short axis diameter was noted.\\nFlexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed no remarkable finding, though transbronchial multiple biopsies obtained from the right anterior segmental bronchus showed some lymphocytic infiltration. Cytologic analysis showed that the composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 45% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 54% macrophages. Open lung biopsy was performed in areas of both higher and lower attenuation. Histologic examination disclosed focal collections of lymphoid cells around bronchioles and extension of lymphoma cells from bronchiolar epithelium toward alveolar space. Immunocytochemically, the neoplastic cells reacted positively for CD 20 antigen and were focally positive for UCHL 1 antigen. Monoclonal antibody against cytokeratin indicated multiple lymphoepithelial lesions. The histologic diagnosis was consistent with low grade marginal zone B-cell lymphoma originating in BALT.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 14-year-old girl was referred to the Danish Center of Interstitial Lung Disease, Aarhus University Hospital for specialized treatment due to a newly diagnosed aPAP. She complained of a constant cough and dyspnea on exertion starting a year before referral. Neither antibiotics nor inhaled corticosteroids improved the patient's condition and further investigations were performed at another hospital. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed bilateral changes typical for PAP with not a classical crazy paving pattern (Fig. 1). A surgical biopsy revealed alveoli filled with a granular proteinaceous material, strongly eosinophilic on hematoxylin-and eosin staining (HE) and positive with the periodic acid-Schiff stain and diastase-resistant (PAS + D), which is considered characteristic for PAP (Fig. 2). Blood assays showed elevated high levels of GM-CSF antibodies. There was no suspicion of rheumatological or hematological diseases. Based on these results a diagnosis of aPAP was confirmed and the patient was referred for treatment.\\nAt the time of referral to our department the patient reported regular cough and dyspnea upon physical exertion. She had no weight loss, fever or recurrent infections. She had no family history of lung disease and was a never-smoker. Physical examination was normal. Pulmonary function tests revealed a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.23 L (62%), forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.64 L (70%), total lung capacity (TLC) of 72% and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) of 54% of predicted. Arterial gas analysis showed pO2 within a normal range of 14.3 kPa. According to the classification proposed by Inoue et al. her disease severity score (DSS) was 2 (symptomatic and PaO2 over 70 mmHg). After evaluation of the patient's history she was treated with WLL without improvement. After the third WLL, supporting treatment with inhaled GM-SCF was therefore initiated. Firstly, sargramostim (Leukine; Sanofi-Aventis; 250 mug x 2 per week) was used for a short period, but when molgramostim became available in a named patient program, it was decided to change the inhalations to rhGM-CSF - molgramostim (Molgradex; Savara Pharmaceuticals). We chose the following treatment protocol: 300 mug daily in seven days repeated with seven days of pause. After seven months, the therapy was intensified to 300 mug daily. HRCT one year after the treatment did not reveal significant regression of the crazy-paving pattern. Nevertheless, there was a significant clinical improvement with remission of all her symptoms, as well as in her pulmonary function, which almost normalized. After 17 months of molgramostim inhalations her FEV1 was 2.58 (79%), FVC 3.05 (79%), TLC 77% and DLCO 74% of predicted. No adverse effects of the molgramostim inhalations were observed. The patient is now stable, and the inhalations have been discontinued.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 52-year-old woman without a family history of migraine and dystonia was admitted to our department due to intractable migraine for about 5 days and walking difficulties for 1 day. She has had a history of headaches for over 20 years with one or two attacks per year described as a throbbing or swelling pain in the occipital region or even the whole brain with an intensity of 6 to 9/10. There was no significant aura before the attack. The headache attack was accompanied by numbness and coldness of the painful area and stiffness of the neck, and nausea and vomiting without photophobia or phonophobia. At worst, she could not take in any food or medicine because of vomiting. The headache usually lasted for 5-6 days and could last up to 15 days, and was slightly relieved by ibuprofen and flunarizine. On the fourth day of this attack, she suddenly suffered an inability to walk lasting for 1 day. She could stand on her own without any dizziness. However, every time she tried to start walking, she felt stiffness in both lower extremities and was unable to step and walk, but could only maintain an upright position. And, it did not change with prolonged standing time. In addition, no movement other than walking was affected. When she was lying down, the movement of both lower extremities was not restricted and she could raise and lower her legs and move them in any direction at will. The same symptom happened once 6 years ago, and it resolved on its own after lasting for 1 h.\\nThe physical examination and vital signs were unremarkable, and the neurologic examination was normal. The patient showed a task-specific lower limbs dystonia, characterized by the appearance of sustained dystonic extension of both knees induced by stepping or walking attempts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain showed no significant abnormalities (Figure 1). The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 125 mm H2O (normal range: 80-180 mmH2O), and the biochemistry and cytology of the CSF were negative. Her blood tests were regular, including routine blood work, liver function, kidney function, ions, D-dimer, and markers of myocardial damage. The contrast transcranial doppler echocardiography (cTCD) showed a latent and massive right-to-left shunt (RLS), that was, more than 25 microbubbles were detected using insonation of the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) after the release of the Valsalva maneuver (Figure 2). No microbubble was seen in the resting state. Right heart contrast echocardiography confirmed the result. Her echocardiography revealed no abnormalities in the structure and function of the heart at rest.\\nFinally, the patient was diagnosed with migraine and dystonia of the lower extremities induced by it. The cTCD and right heart contrast echocardiography suggested that she had a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was required to clarify her heart condition further. The patient's headache lasted for 12 days and was relieved with oral ibuprofen (two capsules per day) and flunarizine (10 mg per day). The symptom of the inability to walk cleared spontaneously staying for 1 day, and she was capable of walking slowly and awkwardly during the consultation. Other than medicines for headaches, no additional treatment was given, similar to the situations 6 years ago. Considering the presence of PFO, we recommended she avoid actions that would increase chest pressure, such as diving, violent coughing, and strenuous exercise, which would be of considerable benefit for preventing her headaches. At a follow-up 6 months after the attack, the patient had no episodes of headache and walking difficulty. Unfortunately, owing to financial problems, the patient did not undergo a relevant genetic test, making it difficult to explore the etiology of her condition further.\",\n",

The initial suspicion was from an abnormal pap smear done 3 years ago showing possible adenocarcinoma cells. Endometrial biopsy was done and showed high grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with serous features. The patient underwent surgical staging 4 months later with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and omentectomy. Out of the total 21 resected lymph nodes, one was involved with cancer and the carcinoma was staged at T3aN1M0, Stage 3.\\nFollowing surgical staging and tumor resection, the patient underwent chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel at 21-day intervals, followed by pelvic radiotherapy (planned total dose 5040 cGy), and finally three additional cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Initial doses of carboplatin were targeted at 750 mg/cycle (AUC = 6) and paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2. Because of extended duration radiation related Grade 3 colitis, radiation therapy was stopped after receipt of 1980 cGy. Patient then underwent 3 more cycles (cycles 4-6) of chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The total cumulative dose of paclitaxel was 1511 mg and that of carboplatin was 4312 mg.\\nPrior to beginning chemotherapy, the patient had normal blood counts except for a mild iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 gm/dL, white blood cell count 7200/mm3, and platelets 168,000/mm3). Her platelet count after completion of radiation therapy was 120,000-140,000/mm3, with mild anemia and a normal white blood cell count. After receiving the sixth and final dose of chemotherapy, her platelet count fell to 80,000/mm3 and did not recover.\\nSix months after last cycle of chemotherapy, patient was hospitalized thrice over a period of two months with high grade fevers. She had worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia during this period which prompted a bone marrow biopsy. This revealed a hypercellular marrow with overall 5% myeloblasts with megaloblastic changes in the red cells and myeloid series and normal appearing megakaryocytes (Figures 1 -3). The peripheral blood showed marked anisocytosis with moderate normocytic normochromic anemia and left shifted myeloid series and thrombocytopenia (Figure 4). The findings were consistent with treatment related myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia and excess blasts. Karyotyping revealed abnormal female karyotype: 45,XX,add(3)(p13),del(3)(q23q25),-5,add(5)(q13),add(7)(q11.2),der(17)t(5,17)(q15;q25).\\nWithin six weeks of the diagnosis of myelodysplasia, she had progressed to acute leukemia. Initial lab work revealed leukocytosis up to 76000 with 22% blasts; anemia with Hb 6.4 g/dL; and thrombocytopenia with counts of 15,000/mm3. She was given a provisional diagnosis of therapy related AML. A bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow with 29% of cells blasts. The blasts exhibited both myeloid and monocytic features and a diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML; FAB classification: M4) was made. Peripheral smear also showed persistent leukocytosis with blasts >27% along with anemia and thrombocytopenia which eventually required transfusions.\\nPatient was offered treatment options including chemotherapy for AML and then possible stem cell transplant but decided not to pursue chemotherapy and opted for supportive treatment.

Examination revealed a tumescent left supraclavicular lymph node (no mass was touched in the breast). Imaging revealed multiple hypermetabolic foci of FDG in the proximal axial bone and appendage bone as well as multiple and tumescent lymph nodes on the bilateral pulmonary hilum. There was no sign of viscera metastases. Core biopsy showed poorly differentiated metastatic breast carcinoma that was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and strongly human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) positive (3+).\\nPalliative chemotherapy with docetaxel (75 mg/m2), cisplatin (75 mg/m2), and trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, first treatment using 8 mg/kg) was started for 6 cycles, followed by two cycles of docetaxel and trastuzumab treatment. After the treatment, CT scanning showed that all the lymph nodes disappeared and symptoms of pain all over the body had also been relieved. Nevertheless, the patient's platelet count decreased to 48 x 109/L before the 9th treatment. Docetaxel-induced bone marrow suppression was suspected, and trastuzumab and capecitabine (1.5 g, bid, 1-14 d) were used for the 9th treatment. Meanwhile, recombinant human thrombopoietin (TPO) was injected to increase the platelet level. As anticipated, the platelet count returned to normal in 3 days.\\nBefore the 10th treatment, the platelet count of the patient was 99 x 109/L (Figure 1a). Trastuzumab and capecitabine were used again for the 10th treatment. The patient felt tiredness and nausea and all-over body petechiae, and gums bleeding occurred after a 6 h trastuzumab infusion. Blood examination showed that the platelet count was 1 x 109/L. Blood smear examination showed severe thrombocytopenia with no schistocytes, spherocytes, clumps, and giant platelets. Bone marrow biopsy showed normal megakaryocytopoiesis without signs of tumor infiltration. Heparin had never been used and other causes of thrombocytopenia such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis were excluded because of her normal clotting, D-dimers, immunoglobulins, hemoglobin, renal function, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase as well as lack of schistocytes. After consultation with the hematologist, drug-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected. Given the treatment effect of trastuzumab, capecitabine was withdrawn and 3 weekly trastuzumab was maintained. After treatment with platelet transfusion, TPO, and corticosteroids, the platelet count returned to the normal level (Figure 1b). Trastuzumab alone was used for the 11th treatment. Dental bleeding, diffuse petechiae and ecchymosis occurred again in 24 h after the infusion and the platelet count decreased to 5 x 109/L (Figure 1c). The new bone marrow biopsy results were consistent with the previous one. After reviewing the treatment process and referring to relevant literature, a diagnosis of trastuzumab-induced thrombocytopenia was finally made. After treatment with platelet transfusion, TPO and corticosteroids, the platelet count returned to normal.\\n Consent: Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report.\",\n",

She was treated with excision and underwent lymphadenectomy. No other adjuvant treatment was initiated. In 2015, she was diagnosed twice with a solitary \"in-transit\" metastasis on the right leg for which excision was performed. At the end of 2015, a third solitary in-transit metastasis on the right leg was diagnosed, which was also excised, unfortunately without achieving histological radicality. Due to the persistent recurrences of metastatic disease, BRAF mutation was analysed and showed BRAF V600 positivity of the tumour. At that time, ultrasound showed a viable, intrauterine monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy with a gestational age of 65/7 weeks. Intralesional chemotherapy was indicated due to the non-radical excision, but was deemed unsafe considering the early pregnancy. Instead, re-excision under local field block anaesthetic was performed. One month later, another two in-transit metastases on the right leg were excised.\\nTwo months after the last excision, she presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, and constipation. Ultrasound and MRI showed an intussusception of the jejunum over a length of 10-15 cm, para-aortal lymphadenopathy, and a viable pregnancy of 18 weeks. She underwent a laparotomy, confirming the diagnosis of intussusception. The affected jejunum was resected. Histologic examination of the resected bowel and a sample of the tumours palpable in the mesentery showed metastatic melanoma. A PET/CT scan at 216/7 weeks of gestation (low-dose 18F-FDG, with bladder catheter) showed multiple cutaneous and breast metastases. An MRI of the brain showed solitary metastases in the temporal lobe. Due to the high tumour load, non-viable gestational age with the wish to continue her pregnancy and a BRAF V600 pathogenic mutation of the tumour, the patient was started on vemurafenib (twice a day, 960 mg) at a gestational age of 225/7 weeks after extensive counselling. At that time, both fetuses had normal weight on ultrasound, and no congenital anomalies were seen. Twelve days after commencing vemurafenib, our patient reported some mild skin toxicity, starting with some erythema on the face and back. The skin lesions rapidly worsened within 9 days with profound erythema and blisters on the neck, thorax, and arms covering over 70% of her body surface area, and purulent discharge from the eyes. Following this rapid progression of skin toxicity, our patient was admitted to the hospital and vemurafenib was immediately discontinued. Skin biopsy showed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit the next day, where she was sedated and intubated for pain management. She required extensive rehydration due to significant insensible loss. In addition, betamethasone for fetal lung maturation was given in anticipation of preterm delivery because of maternal deterioration. There were no signs of spontaneous preterm labour or intrauterine infection. At a gestational age of 262/7 weeks, 25 days after the start of vemurafenib and within 1 day after intubation, the patient was transferred in a sedated state to an academic centre with both a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and burn specialty unit to provide optimal care for her second-degree TEN lesions, which now covered 98% of her body and oral mucosa (Fig. 1). On arrival, she was found to be in labour and she delivered both children while still sedated (first baby by forceps extraction, second baby by breech extraction). Two baby boys were born with birth weights within the normal range; one with a birth weight of 950 g and an APGAR score of 2 and 3 at respectively 5 and 10 min and one with a birth weight of 900 g and an APGAR score of 6 at 5 and 10 min. Both children were admitted to the NICU.\\nDuring the burn centre hospitalization, some re-epithelialization occurred, but unfortunately, the patient suffered several episodes of wound infection which delayed the wound healing. Initial topical treatment with alginate dressing was replaced by silver sulphadiazine upon diagnosis of pseudomonas wound infection. The mucosal lesions in the mouth caused significant bleeding. Oral rinsing with povidone solutions seemed effective but caused a iodide intoxication with hypothyroidism and a high anion gap acidosis. Corneal erosions and conjunctival adhesions were treated intensively in collaboration with the ophthalmologist. The first weeks were characterized by fluid loss and oedema, and pleural effusion complicated weaning from the ventilator. Once stabilized, the patient responded well to diuretics. Renal function remained normal throughout the burn centre stay. After delivery, oncological treatment with pembrolizumab would have been indicated once the TEN had improved and clinical condition improved. However, 53 days after delivery and 78 days after the start of vemurafenib, and before our patient could start with pembrolizumab, she died of an intracranial haemorrhage due to metastatic disease.\\nBoth children were discharged from NICU to special nursery care 59 days after delivery and were discharged home 95 days after delivery. At a corrected age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities. Mental development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID). The first-born boy (birth weight 950 g) is developing normally, with a Bayley cognitive development score of 82 (developmental age of 15 months). The second boy (birth weight 900 g) was not able to undergo cognitive testing due to persisted crying, but his family did not notice any developmental delay.

During her admission, dyspnea was developed; so pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed and pulmonary emboli was demonstrated (Figure 1). In addition to dyspnea she was complaining of abdominal pain and non-bloody diarrhea. Thrombosis of intra-abdominal vessels was ruled out with magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Since her abdominal pain was resistant to analgesics and she had a past surgical history of appendectomy, abdominal CT scan was performed which showed sub-mucosal bleeding and thickness of jejunum indicating probable IBD diagnosis. The patient underwent colonoscopy due to abdominal pain, past medical history, intermittent non-bloody diarrhea, and abdominal CT findings. Unexpectedly, patchy ulceration was seen coincident of IBD (Figure 2). The patient was treated by intravenous un-fractionated heparin and discharged on warfarin. Follow up in out-patient clinic for international normalized ratio (INR) level monitoring (target between 2 and 3) was arranged.',\n",

The vomiting was intermittent, non-bloody, at times bilious, and occasionally contained food particles. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which demonstrated debris within a dilated proximal duodenum. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) were visualized with the SMA lying to the left of the SMV with normal anatomic alignment [Figure 1]. No large solid or cystic masses were seen.\\nA standard barium single contrast upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series was performed with the contrast entering the antrum and duodenal bulb. The proximal duodenum and descending duodenum were markedly dilated in caliber with apparent tapering of the third part of the duodenum. There was an abrupt cutoff with no contrast extending beyond approximately the mid abdomen [Figure 2]. Delayed images were obtained while the patient was supine with contrast never extending beyond the third portion of the duodenum [Figure 3].\\nPatient was subsequently placed prone for several minutes with eventual slight transit of contrast [Figure 4]. Thirty minute delayed prone images demonstrated contrast in the proximal small bowel, however proximal duodenum remained markedly dilated and contrast/debris filled [Figure 5]. Additionally delayed overhead images demonstrated contrast extending to the distal small bowel after patient had been upright for greater than 30 minutes [Figure 6]. Markedly dilated proximal duodenum with abrupt cutoff in the third portion of the duodenum raised concern for a questionable mass like positionally dependent extrinsic compression of the third portion of the duodenum.\\nA subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with oral and intravenous contrast. The duodenum was distended with the third part of the duodenum tented downward [Figure 7]. The duodenal/jejunal junction was severely narrowed and coursed distally anterior to the right common femoral artery below the bifurcation [Figure 7].\\nThe patient was taken for an exploratory laparotomy and found to have dense vascularized bands without intestinal malrotation. Upon entering the abdomen, the cecum was noted to be in normal anatomical position. Further exploration in the abdomen revealed the proximal jejunum tethered by dense vascularized bands running from approximately five inches distal to the ligament of Treitz down into the pelvis. The cecum was incidentally noted to be folded back on itself and adherent to this tented portion of the jejunum. After these adhesions were ligated, the bowel was examined and no other anatomical abnormalities were discovered.

She was suspected to have SLE because of facial erythema at age 29 years, but clinical and serological findings failed to satisfy the diagnosis criteria for SLE. She gave birth to two boys without any problems at age 23 years (birth weight, 2822 g) and 26 years (birth weight, 2946 g). The fetal heart monitor showed non-reassuring fetal status. A female neonate was born by emergency cesarean delivery at 35 weeks and 3 days. The neonate weight was 1,909 g. She had fetal growth restriction (FGR) and Apgar scores of 5 and 7 (1 minute and 5 minutes). Her skin was pale. She had congenital erythematous and scar lesions on the face, back, and upper and lower extremities (Figure 1). An examination revealed a slight elevation in hepatic transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and mild cardiac failure. No heart blockage was detected. The serological examination of the neonate showed elevated anti-SSA/Ro (281 U/mL) and anti-SSB/La antibodies ( 1000 U/mL). Other antibodies were normal range (anti-DNA antibody  2.0 IU/mL, anti-RNP antibody <2.0 U/mL), and complements were not reduced (C3; 92 mg/dl, C4; 22 mg/dl). The serological examination of the mother also showed elevation of these antibodies, and a histological examination demonstrated lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary gland; therefore, a diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome was made.

Prior treatment included Mohs micrographic surgery and skin grafting. The patient underwent resection by an otolaryngologist, and the tumor was found within the orbit, with extension into the frontal sinus, posterior orbital wall, ethmoid sinus, and inferiorly into the superior edge of the medial maxillary wall. The orbital wall was reconstructed using titanium mesh embedded within a polyethylene implant, and, in 2012, a free flap was performed, followed by radiation and left eye enucleation.\\nThe patient recovered from surgery but, over the next few years, continued to develop additional primary KCs at sites separate from the location of reconstruction, including SCCs on the right submental neck, right forehead, and left ear. Acitretin was taken for 2 months for chemoprevention of KC but was discontinued in early 2016 because of poor wound healing. One month later, the patient had significant pain and a small erosion of his left medial orbital rim, which he attributed to chafing from the bridge of his eyeglasses. Given concern for possible SCC recurrence with supratrochlear nerve involvement, a shave biopsy was obtained at the site of the patient's pain (Fig 1, A). There was a white linear plaque lateral to the biopsy site. Initially, this clinically appeared to be lichenification caused by recurrent friction from the patient's eye patch. The biopsy performed to rule out recurrent SCC showed spongiotic psoriasiform dermatitis likely of multifactorial etiology from past radiation therapy and erosive pustular dermatosis. He soon developed a 2-cm ulcer with clear exposure of the implant (Fig 1, B). Continued expansion of the ulcer while awaiting surgical resection raised concern for infection, recurrent SCC (assuming sampling error of the previous biopsy), poor wound healing secondary to prior usage of acitretin, and inflammatory dermatoses such as pyoderma gangrenosum or a variant of erosive pustular dermatosis (Fig 1, C). Treatment consisted of removal of hardware, left orbital exenteration, and free-flap reconstruction (Fig 1, D).

       "    'case_text': 'Efforts in domestic HIV prevention prioritize working with disproportionately affected groups, including youth as a priority group, to meet national goals to reduce new HIV infections, increase engagement of infected persons in care, and decrease HIV-related health disparities. National and local data suggest that among youth aged 13-24, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino youth carry the largest burden of disease, especially during the time of this study (see Figure 1a). For example in 2015, Black youth only made up 14% of the 13-19 year old population in the U.S., yet these youth accounted for 64% of new HIV diagnoses. The causes of these disparities are multi-level, including the role of mental health and emotion regulation in youth\\'s sexual decision making and neighborhood-level poverty and disadvantage. These data underscore that research and program efforts with racial/ethnic minority youth, including individual and macro-level approaches, are urgently needed for domestic HIV prevention.\\nTo facilitate routine HIV/STI testing and treatment and access for youth, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws in place that allow most minors (aged 12-17) to consent for their own sexual health care without parental permission:31 states explicitly include HIV testing and treatment as part of services accessible to youth. Despite these supportive HIV/STI care access policies for youth, and an ethical context which supports HIV/STI prevention and control with at-risk populations, controversy about parental permission and minors\\' \"maturity\" remain in research. According to the; see 45 CFR 46.402): \"assent\" is defined as a child\\'s affirmative agreement to participate in research; \"permission\" is defined as the agreement of parent(s) or guardian(s) to the participation of their child or ward in research; and \"informed consent\" occurs when someone who is legally able to consent (> age 18 years) gives permission after having the knowledge of the possible risks, probable consequences, and alternatives. Empirical data support minors\\' competence to consent to research from the age of 12 and above, with recommendations for a dual child and parent consent only when the child has not reached the age where he/she is allocated rights for independent consent. Before the age of 12, or if the child has not reached the age of independent consent, minors may assent to research along with their parents\\'/guardians\\' consent for their participation (; see 45 CFR 46.408).\\nValid medical, legal and ethical concerns exist regarding parental permission, waivers of permission, assent or consent by youth, and the definition of \"child\"/\"minor\" (someone under the age of majority, usually less than 18 years) in youth-focused practice and research. These issues are complex and often challenging for investigators, institutional review boards (IRBs), parents, youth, and community advisors. In addition, federal and local laws should be considered and balanced with the goals of protecting youth from risks. Understanding youths\\' evolving maturity and autonomy and the importance of low-risk, biobehavioral and clinical research activities for youth-focused public health practice warrant consideration.\\nAt the intersection of ethics and law, two key areas potentially cause controversy in IRB determinations for sexual health research with youth: 1) level of risk, and 2) whether minors are emancipated for medical decision making under state or local law. Minimal risk studies are those in which the \"probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests\" (; see 45 CFR 46.102(i)). note that in the absence of empirical data on the risks of daily life and routine examinations among children, IRB members may default to intuitive judgement of these risks, which can lead to systematic errors in interpretation and implementation of federal regulations. An IRB\\'s assessment of minimal risk may also vary by institutional setting (e.g., academic center or hospital). In addition to risk determination, federal, state and local laws regulate issues such as the age of medical emancipation which determines whether minors can make medical decisions in the absence of a parent/guardian. From a research perspective, conflict can arise when IRBs disagree on the interpretation of state law in relation to a study\\'s level of risk.\\nDuring research collaborations, when multiple IRBs provide study oversight, the views and perspectives of IRB members may differ. These IRB disagreements can be challenging if they potentially lead to research delays, especially if the research is addressing public health prevention priorities, such as sexual health. noted the potential negative implications of local and federal IRB disagreements and suggested lessons learned to facilitate future adolescent sexual health research. Our current experiences (2012-2013) suggest that more still needs to be done to improve timeliness of human subjects\\' reviews, reduce IRB disagreements, and improve synergies among multiple entities in a youth-focused research team.\\nIn this paper, we describe challenges and successes in the pre-research, human subjects\\' local and federal review processes that were undertaken before beginning a youth-focused, HIV/STI prevention research project with sexually active youth. The case study explains the issues we faced when seeking approval for a minimal risk study involving Black youth of minority age, all of whom were receiving outpatient mental health care services. At center stage was the controversy surrounding whether or not a waiver of parental consent was legally or ethically necessary under the federal rules for human subjects protection. Final approval was received by the federal funding agency, the local health department, and the University after reaching an understanding about the level of risk of the study and the fact that the youth were medically emancipated minors who were competent to consent to research participation under applicable state law. We believe the lessons learned through working with two IRBs and federal-level reviewers, and seeking a non-IRB-affiliated youth-expert legal opinion, may provide important contextual information for others working with youth in HIV/STI prevention research. Additionally, given youth-related consent challenges in both clinical research and practice, this topic may have implications for broader health-related strategies with youth, which are especially important given the urgent context of HIV/STIs among racial/ethnic minority youth.\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania is a northeastern city whose large, urban school districts ranked second nationally (after Memphis, Tennessee) among similar school districts on percentage of high school students who ever had sexual intercourse (61.0%, 95% CI: 56.1-65.6%) and who first had sexual intercourse before 13 years of age (15.1%, 95% CI:13.0-17.5%). Data from Philadelphia high school districts also ranked their high school students first among similar school districts regarding the percentage reporting four or more sex partners during their lifetime (27.2%, 95% CI:23.9-30.8%) and sexual activity during the most recent three-month period (44.9%, 95% CI: 40.4-49.6%). At the time of our study (2011), the rate of diagnoses of new HIV infections among youth aged 13-24 in Philadelphia was 56.1 per 100,000 population, over twice the national rate of 26 per 100,000 for persons aged 13-24 (; see Figure 1b).\\nGiven the high rates of sexual risk behaviors among youth with mental illnesses and behavioral disorders, our HIV/STI risk-reduction study focused on youth receiving care in outpatient mental health treatment programs who reported current sexual activity. At the time of the study, the most common psychiatric diagnoses among Black youth in mental health treatment in Philadelphia were: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (43%), adjustment disorder (36%), oppositional defiant disorder (23%), disruptive behavior disorder (14%), and depression (11%); none of which are barriers to consenting for one\\'s own care if under age 18 and assessed as competent by the mental health care providers. Due to the local epidemiology in Philadelphia, with Black youth being disproportionately affected by HIV/STIs, we sought to enroll youth aged 14-17 years who self-identified as Black (any racial or ethnic designation throughout the African diaspora) to develop and test an HIV/STI prevention intervention for at-risk Black youth receiving mental health treatment in an urban area.\\nIn the state of Pennsylvania, minors (youth aged 14 to 17) can legally consent to both mental health treatment and HIV/STI testing and treatment without parental consent (Juvenile Law Center, 2006). This is especially important in the context of biobehavioral research, because under federal regulations, children are \"persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatment or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted\" (; see 45 CFR 46.402(a)). This has been interpreted to mean that if a minor is able to consent to medical health services under state law, the minor is also able to consent to participate in medical research. Therefore, the informed consent of minors in Pennsylvania is legally sufficient for participation and no parental permission or waiver is required.\\nWe proposed to develop and test a HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention with sexually active Black youth receiving outpatient mental health treatment in Philadelphia. We established a youth-led community advisory board (CAB) and a youth advocate/ombudsman to ensure that the perspectives of the target population were infused through each aspect of the study. The youth CAB also created the study name: \"We are Kings and Queens.\"\\nFor the group-level behavioral intervention (Authors), participants were randomized to either the HIV/STI risk-reduction program (treatment; n = 51) or general health promotion program (control; n = 57). The intervention consisted of a two-day, six- hour, skills-based, interactive educational program. The study procedures included focus group discussions (to inform the intervention content), electronic surveys (to collect demographic and behavioral data), diagnostic case ascertainment with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, urine specimen collection for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing, and an oral swab for OraQuick ADVANCE  Rapid HIV-1/2 antibody testing (unless declined by the participant). Laboratory testing was conducted for participants in both intervention conditions.\\nThese research procedures were specific to the study and not part of routine care at the treatment programs. Two of the partnering agencies, however, did have relationships with outside providers to offer HIV testing onsite, reflecting moves toward the integration of HIV and behavioral health treatment. The primary outcome was consistent condom use. Secondary outcomes included sexual activity (frequency of vaginal, anal and oral sex), the number of concurrent and sequential sex partners, and laboratory confirmed HIV/STIs. We performed assessments at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.\\nBefore beginning the study, human subjects approval was required from three groups: 1) the IRB of the academic home institution; 2) the IRB of the local health department; and 3) the reviewers at the federal agency that funded the study. The study materials were submitted to each group and revised several times to clarify wording and address concerns. Changes made to meet the requirements of one agency were resubmitted to the other agencies for their review and approval. Full board review was required given the study\\'s complexity, which meant (at minimum) month-long waiting periods between review meetings. Some of the discussion points included: the appropriateness of mixed-gender focus groups for adolescent sexual health research, confidential recruitment of adolescent participants in clinics when parents/guardians are present, and actions to be taken for positive HIV/STI test results (e.g., linkage to care procedures). Additionally, given our target group of youth with mental illnesses, there was increased attention to human subjects\\' protections due to concerns regarding competency to provide consent and whether parents/guardians would be notified if their child tested positive for HIV/STIs.\\nThrough a series of face-to-face meetings and email exchanges, we worked to address the concerns. We advocated for mixed-gender focus groups to preserve the richness of data that stems from the interactive dialogue between heterosexually-active males and females. We emphasized the high caliber training our facilitators received and created a behavioral management plan, at the IRB\\'s request, to indicate how we would handle potentially challenging group dynamics. For participant recruitment when a parent/guardian was present, we agreed that recruiters would directly address both the parent/guardian and adolescent, identifying himself/herself as a research team member for a study on teen relationships. The adolescent was then informed that he/she could call the number on the business card for additional information. Adolescents were not screened in the presence of parents/guardians, and parents/guardians were not given details about the study. However, if a parent/guardian stated they did not want their child to participate in the study (at the time of approach or any time thereafter) we conceded to the IRBs request that we would not contact or enroll the adolescent in the study, even if he/she independently expressed interest in participation. Given that our target population of youth had all provided consent for their mental health treatment, the IRB approved our determination of competence to provide consent by study personnel as part of the screening process for enrollment. All participants were notified of their HIV/STI results. Those who tested positive for Chlamydia or Gonorrhea (n = 8, 7.4% at baseline) were notified of their results and referred to receive free treatment through the local department, or from their primary care provider. No participants tested positive for HIV, but positive cases would have been followed by the AIDS Service Organization that conducted the testing for confirmatory tests and linkage to care. While we were able to resolve these issues, there was a fundamental disagreement in the interpretation of the state law between the investigators and the review entities. The research team did not believe parental permission was warranted/applicable, while several local IRB members required parental permission, or at minimum, a solid justification for the appropriateness of a waiver.\\nBased on Pennsylvania minor consent laws, the participants in this study did not qualify as minors (they did not meet the regulatory definition of minor) for purposes of human subject review; when minors do not meet these qualifications, they can participate in research as adults. Despite the documented legal guidance, obtaining approval became a challenge when the local and federal agencies disagreed about whether parental permission was required for the study. More specifically, the minors\\' consent to medical health services was not viewed by all parties as sufficient to justify research consent. In the opinion of several IRB members, medical/mental health care was a necessity, while research involvement was a voluntary procedure that they believed would require parental involvement. In other words, at the intersection of ethics and law, some reviewers believed that while the minor was medically emancipated under state law to make decisions, the ethical risk associated with research participation outweighed the state regulations.\\nWe had multiple discussions with the committee members to provide context and accurate data regarding the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the protected confidentiality of medical data, the urgency of the HIV epidemic among young people in Philadelphia (see Figure 1b), and the legal ramifications of sharing adolescent test results with parents without youth consent. We also provided information to the local and federal review agencies about the state laws and federal guidance in support of minors\\' consent for their own mental health and sexual health services. For example, the stated that \"...assent of such mature minors should be considered sufficient with respect to research about conditions for which they have legal authority to consent on their own treatment\" (pg. 18). Thus, although parental permission was not technically applicable under state law and federal guidance (Juvenile Law Center, 2006), our ethical review process required that we address the issue of parental permission/involvement.\\nWe advocated to consent participants in the absence of parental involvement for several reasons: 1) to protect the youth participants\\' privacy regarding their involvement in consensual sex; 2) to ensure youth receive HIV/STI testing and treatment (if needed); 3) to encourage participants to give honest answers to the study questions (without fear of parent/guardian reactions); and 4) to be in line with state and federal guidance on the issue. Previous research with youth suggests that requiring parental permission may decrease their interest in participating in biobehavioral research, especially when STI testing is involved. In addition, some parents/guardians may request to receive their child\\'s test results, which would be counter to the youth\\'s desires and legal precedent for maintaining their confidentiality. Requiring parental permission would also violate local and federal rights and breach confidentiality for youth whose parents/guardians did not know that they were receiving mental health treatment, engaging in consensual sexual activity and possibly seeking sexual health services.\\nDespite eleven separate meetings and discussions, the local and federal approving agencies were unable to reach initial consensus about parental involvement. The federal funding agency waited to consider the decisions of the two local IRBs before completing its review. The local IRBs suggested obtaining a youth-focused third party review of the protocol to help support a decision. We contacted attorneys at the Juvenile Law Center, a non-IRB-affiliated youth-legal expert firm in Philadelphia. They reviewed the study materials and concluded that the study\\'s consent provisions were consistent with the Mental Health Procedures Act and HIPAA:a minor in Pennsylvania age 14-17 did not need parental consent to participate in the study. After several review and feedback sessions, both the academic institution and local health department IRBs approved written informed consent by the adolescent participants and waivers of parental permission for their parents. Approval by the local IRBs facilitated the green light by the federal agency to begin the study. The study was approved by all required local and federal bodies in March 2013; overall, a 14-month timeline for full review and approval of this protocol with associated suboptimal use of human and fiscal resources due to the lengthy delay.',\n",

His chest pain was pleuritic. He was discharged a week earlier from a 1-day hospital stay on a 10-day course of dexamethasone for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection, which he was unable to take. He was maintaining oxygen saturation of 88% on 6 L nasal cannula. Initial blood work was remarkable for leukocytosis 25.86 (ref: 3.1-8.50 x 103/uL) with bands elevated at 9%, anion gap 15, lactic acid elevated 3.3 (ref: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L), mild transaminitis with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 113, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 153. Physical examination was remarkable for decreased air entry with bilateral crepitation. Computed tomography pulmonary embolus study confirmed presence of bilateral acute pulmonary emboli with possible right heart strain and bilateral infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. He was treated with heparin infusion, remdesivir, dexamethasone, 1 dose of vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam as well as supportive breathing treatments consisting of albuterol nebulization as needed. He was then admitted to the medical floors for further management.\\nEchocardiogram obtained later was resulted as normal left ventricular function with ejection fraction 55% to 65% with normal right ventricular pressure and no evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. Heparin infusion, remdesivir, and dexamethasone were continued. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were given the initial 2 days to cover for superimposed bacterial pneumonia and later deescalated to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on days 3 and 4 of hospitalization. Ultrasound abdomen done on day 4 showed no abnormalities within the liver or gallbladder.\\nDuring hospitalization, patient was noticed to have worsening of liver enzymes which peaked at ALT 721 IU/L (normal <55 U/L) and AST 305 IU/L (normal value < 35 U/L). Other laboratory values were gamma-glutamyl transferase 114 IU/L (ref: 12-64 IU/L), albumin 2.7 g/dL (ref: 3.4-4.8 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase 49 IU/L (ref: 56-119 IU/L), and international normalized ratio 1.5. Further workup showed pro-calcitonin minimally elevated at 0.28 (ref: <0.05 ng/mL), d-dimer elevated at 12.89 (ref: <0.5 mg/dL), and fibrinogen was normal. His blood alcohol and acute hepatitis panel were negative on day 2 of hospital admission. Acetaminophen levels obtained on hospital day 4 were <0.6 (ref 0.00-50.0 microg/mL). At that point, remdesivir was discontinued on day 2 of admission as it was thought to have contributed to worsening of liver function. Antibiotics were discontinued as bacterial infection was less likely and it was thought amoxicillin-clavulanic acid could also have contributed to liver enzyme abnormalities. Computed tomography abdomen and pelvis with contrast (day 8) showed mild splenomegaly with no abnormalities noted in the liver or gall bladder.\\nDespite discontinuation of remdesivir, antibiotics, and improving oxygen requirements, his liver function continued to worsen (see Table 1) and additional workup including autoimmune work up with anti-smooth muscle antibodies, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis panel were done and reported negative. Further testing with EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology were done, which revealed EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM positivity. He was also positive for EBV VCA IgG, EBV early antigen (EA) IgG, and EBV nuclear antigen (NA) IgG. EBV polymerase chain reaction was reported positive. CMV IgM antibody was negative; however, CMV IgG antibody was positive with reported value >10 (ref: 0.00-0.059).

The amplicons were sequenced by next-generation sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq 150 paired end method (Genomics Lab, Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, Huntsville, Alabama).\\nIllumina sequence reads were analysed using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0. A combination of de novo assembly and subsequent mapping to reference strain was used to obtain the full-length genome of the strain. The assembled gene sequences were aligned with reference rotavirus gene sequences using the ClustalW program within MEGA 5.05 package. Once aligned, the optimal evolutionary model that best fit each sequence dataset was identified using AICc criterion implemented in jModeltest2. The best models identified were TIM3+I (NSP1), TPM2uf+G (NSP2), TIM2+G (NSP3), TPM2uf+I (NSP4), TrN+I+G (NSP5, VP6), TIM2+I (VP1), GTR+I (VP2, VP3), GTR+G (VP4), and TIM3+I+G (VP7). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using PhyML version 3.0 with aLRT statistics computed for estimation of branch support, and p-distances were computed in MEGA 5.05 to determine the similarities of the genes to reference strains in GenBank. The scale bars on the phylogenetic trees represent proportion of substitution on a branch of each tree.

The tumor appeared hypointense on non-contrast T1-weighted images (Fig. 1a) and iso-to hyperintense on T2-weighted images (Fig. 1b). The enhancement of the tumor was irregular and most prominent at its periphery (Fig. 1c-e). The preoperative clinical diagnosis was meningioma or calcified glial tumor.

He had no medical history of glucose intolerance, autoimmune diseases, thyroid dysfunction, or other systemic diseases (e.g., Cushing's syndrome), and no evidence of acute infection, trauma, or drug poisoning. He also had no family history of diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and hereditary diseases. Psychosocial assessment showed that the patient had no mental, physical, or emotional health issues. After unsuccessful treatment with trans-hepatic arterial chemotherapy and embolization (TACE), the patient voluntarily participated in the CISLD-1 trial, provided signed informed consent in July 2019, and started to receive Sintilimab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. Five months after receiving Sintilimab, tumor marker examination and imaging scans showed that the treatment was effective. The patient's alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level decreased to 40.4 mug/L from a baseline level of 9829.9 mug/L (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the tumor nodule in the liver had shrunk dramatically with a response evaluation of partial regression (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Figure 1B). During these months, the patient felt mild fever regularly; however, there was no fatigue, nausea, erythema or any other side effect found.\\nAt 24 weeks, after 8 courses of Sintilimab, the patient presented with increased urination and drinking for 1 week, and blood tests showed that his fasting plasma glucose was as high as 22.2 mmol/L, with an HbA1c value of 7.8%. Considering the high risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, blood gas analysis was performed, which revealed that he had severe metabolic acidosis, with an arterial pH of 7.27, serum bicarbonate of 12.9 mmol/L, and lactate of 1.8 mmol/L. The blood ketone body determination was positive. Therefore, the patient was suspected to have new onset diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis and was admitted to our hospital. Further blood assessment showed that the patient's fasting insulin was as low as 1.5 mIU/L and fasting C-peptide was 1.12 ng/mL (0.78-5.19 ng/mL), which further decreased to 0.21 ng/mL 4 days later. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed that the fasting, 1-, 2-, and 3-h plasma glucose levels were 12.34, 18.32, 28.38, and 25.41 mmol/L, respectively, accompanied by a 2-h postprandial C-peptide level of 0.30 ng/mL and a serum insulin level of 10.4 mIU/L. In addition, the patient's serum inflammatory cytokines, measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrated an interleukin-6 (IL-6) level of 786.32 pg/mL, which decreased to 338.70 pg/mL 2 months later (Table 1). There was no infection, medication, thromboembolic event, or other factor (Autoimmune diseases, Cushing's syndrome, or drug poisoning) that could cause hyperglycemia. Consequently, Sintilimab-induced new-onset autoimmune diabetes was diagnosed. However, the anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) antibody, anti-islet cell antibody (ICA), and anti-insulin (IAA) antibody tests were all negative. In addition, the type 1 diabetes-related alleles of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II, which were explored at the loci of HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 by sequence-based typing primed PCR (Table 2), revealed that the most relevant allele was HLA-A*0201. For other endocrine function assessments, thyroid hormones showed that the patient's serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were slightly decreased, but later become normal without oral thyroxine treatment (Table 1). Moreover, the levels of anterior pituitary hormones and their regulated hormones were all normal (Table 1). The patient received insulin therapy delivered by micropump, maintaining water and electrolyte acid-base balance and other supportive treatment to correct acidosis. Thereafter, he was treated with insulin therapy subcutaneously, which was adjusted daily to the dose of once-daily basal insulin glargine (long-acting insulin, 30 units) plus thrice-daily prandial insulin aspart (fast acting insulin, 14 units) during his hospital stay. The patient's plasma glucose returned to normal levels gradually and he was discharged 10 days later (Figure 2). Subsequently, the patient's plasma glucose was monitored in the outpatient setting and the insulin therapy was gradually adjusted to once-daily basal insulin glargine (28 units) plus thrice-daily prandial insulin aspart (15 units). Then, the patient received continued Sintilimab administration, which resulted in a further decreased in his AFP level (Figure 1A).

       "    'case_text': 'A 34-year-old woman attended our hospital complaining of a palpable mass in the superior lateral quadrant of her right breast. Physical examination revealed a painless and relatively hard, removable mass measuring ~2.6x3.5 cm, with no palpable axillary lymph nodes. Her breast had no nipple discharge, skin ulcers, orange-peel appearance, or nipple retraction. Her medical history included AML (classification: M2) diagnosed 3 years earlier, based on nasosinal space-occupying lesions. She underwent six cycles of chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside and achieved satisfactory disease control and remission, indicated by postchemotherapy bone marrow examination. The patient had no other symptoms or signs and no relevant family history.\\nA mammogram showed a ~2.5x2.4 cm round mass with well-defined, irregular margins in the superior lateral quadrant of the right breast, 4.5 cm from the nipple, with a thick blood vessel passing through the tumor from the chest wall. Another mass was detected in the inferior lateral quadrant of her right breast, 2.1 cm from the nipple, measuring ~1.4x1.1 cm. Several axillary lymph nodes could be observed on the right side, the largest being ~1.9 cm in diameter (Figure 1). Breast ultrasound clearly demonstrated a hypoechoic mass measuring ~3.7x2.6 cm in the superior lateral quadrant of the right breast (Figure 2). The mass was lobulated with an unclear edge, with numerous low-speed bloodstream signals within and close to the mass (resistive index: 0.60). There was another homogenous, hypoechoic mass below the nipple, measuring ~1.8x1.1 cm in diameter, with a clear edge and an irregular shape. Color Doppler flow imaging showed rich blood supply signals from the surrounding soft tissue. There was a well-defined, hypoechoic nodule ~1.8 cm in diameter within the right armpit. No other focal masses were observed on the ultrasonographic image.\\nA complete blood count demonstrated a white blood cell count of 8.07x109/L, a neutrophil count of 5.81x109/L, the hemoglobin levels of 137 g/L, and a platelet count of 188x109/L. The results of chest radiography and abdominopelvic computed tomography were normal. Fine needle aspiration of the two tumors was performed, and inflammatory cell infiltration and granular calcification with several atypical epithelial cells in the background were identified, suggesting possible malignancy. Considering the differential diagnosis between breast cancer and lymphoma, we performed a bone marrow aspirate examination, which revealed no abnormalities. A lumpectomy was therefore performed under local infiltration anesthesia. The cut surface demonstrated two tumors, well-circumscribed in relation to the adjacent structures. The tumors were ~3x3x2.5 cm and 2x2x2 cm and were located ~0.5 cm apart. Based on the examination of frozen sections, the patient was diagnosed with poorly differentiated malignant tumor.\\nPostoperative paraffin-based histopathology showed dense myeloid cellular proliferation with breast tissue invasion. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated that the tumor was strongly positive for myeloperoxidase, CD43, and human leukocyte common antigen (Figure 3); weakly positive for CD20, kappa, lambda, and progesterone receptor; and negative for CD79-alpha, CD3, CD38, CD10, CD5, CD56, AE1/AE3, estrogen receptor, and C-erbB-2. The histological features were consistent with breast GS. The patient was treated with four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy postoperatively (12 mg/m2 idarubicin once a day on days 1 and 2, plus 1 g/m2 cytarabine per half a day on days 1-3) and achieved remission. She was followed up by bone marrow aspiration and breast Doppler ultrasound examinations every 3 months and remained in good health at the 1.5-year follow-up.',\n",

He was otherwise healthy with well-controlled arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected (7x106 copies/ml) from a nasopharyngeal swab (defined as day 1). Laboratory analyses showed a moderate neutropenia, but severe T (114 cell/mm3) and B (1 cell/mm3) lymphopenia with reduced total immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM levels (Supplementary Figure 1A), while inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and ferritin) were elevated (Figure 1A). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral multifocal subpleural and peribronchial ground-glass opacities typical of COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 2). The clinical condition gradually deteriorated with sub-febrile episodes, persisting dry cough and diarrhea, and progressive weight loss and cognitive dysfunction (Figures 1C, D and Supplementary Information). Inflammatory parameters and blood cell counts remained abnormal (Figures 1A, E), while persisting SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed (Supplementary Figure 1B). Complementary investigations excluded other diagnoses (Supplementary Information). No specific antiviral agents were introduced given the mild symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. absence of hypoxemia).\\nIn summary, the patient developed a long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 infection likely related to his severe immunosuppressive status. Consequently, we hypothesized that convalescent plasma could be beneficial in this particular case, by providing virus-specific neutralizing antibodies as well as a potential anti-inflammatory effect. Plasma units (3x200 ml/donor) were obtained from three selected donors, who had fully recovered from mild COVID-19 disease (Supplementary Information). Each donor presented relatively high IgG antibody titers against the S1 (spike)-protein using Euroimmun ELISA (Supplementary Figure 3A). The first cycle of ABO-compatible plasma transfusion (two units on two consecutive days) was given on days 72 and 73 after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by three additional cycles, administered 10 to 15 days apart (Supplementary Figure 3A).',\n",

She had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) at 10 years of age, when she was diagnosed with HoFH with an untreated LDL-cholesterol level ranging between 490 and 549 mg/dl. Her family history was remarkable for early-onset CAD and high cholesterol levels. She had received weekly or biweekly LDL-apheresis therapy since 10 years of age. As her LDL-cholesterol levels were far from the treatment goals, oral lomitapide 5 mg/dl was introduced on top of atorvastatin (80 mg/day) and ezetimibe (10 mg/day) at 20 years of age. The dose was titrated up to 20 mg/dl and has been maintained without adverse events. An additional 31% LDL-cholesterol reduction was observed in the first month of low-dose lomitapide (5 mg/day) therapy. At a dose of 20 mg/day, the LDL-cholesterol reduction reached 49% at the end of 6 months. As she declined to be weaned off apheresis, we reduced the apheresis frequency and she received low-dose lomitapide (20 mg/day) plus concomitant bimonthly apheresis. However, during the pandemic for 1 year, she could not access apheresis. Throughout the 8-year lomitapide treatment, she did not experience any increase in serum liver enzyme levels, weight loss, or liver steatosis. Moreover, no change was observed in hepatic fibro scans. She followed a fat-restricted diet compatible with lomitapide therapy to prevent steatorrhea, with concomitant supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids. Since the commencement of lomitapide therapy, the patient has remained stable at functional class (NYHA-I) without any adverse cardiovascular events.\\nImaging work-up at diagnosis revealed mild aortic stenosis [aortic peak gradient (AoPG) of 30 mmHg-mean (AoMG) 23-18 mmHg] and mild aortic regurgitation with a normal ejection fraction (EF). During the 8-year follow-up, the AoMG was stable at around 25-30 mmHg. In 2022, cardiac catheterization revealed an AoPG of 30 mmHg with normal EF. The computed tomography (CT) angiography showed almost identical coronary and aortal involvement between the baseline (2013) and follow-up (2022) images (Figure 2A). These findings were confirmed by coronary angiography in 2022. Similarly, both the Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) on ultrasonography and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) significantly decreased with lomitapide treatment. Moreover, the minor soft plaque at the orifice of the right carotid artery became calcified with no progression with lomitapide therapy.',\n",

However, he was not diagnosed with HoFH until 20 years of age. He has presented with exertional angina and angiographically extensive ostial coronary stenotic lesions and had undergone CABG accompanied by aortic root dilation at 20 years of age. One year later, he was referred to our lipid clinic for extremely high LDL-cholesterol levels ranging between 420 and 540 mg/dl. Xanthomas were apparent on his elbows, knees, and ankles. He was already prescribed rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) and ezetimibe treatment, and we introduced LDL-apheresis. He lived a 14-h drive from our center; therefore, he receive monthly apheresis. As his LDL-cholesterol levels were still >200 mg/dl post-apheresis, we introduced lomitapide in June 2014, when he was 25 years of age. At the initial dose of oral 5 mg/day, mild nausea was observed. With the up-titrated dose of 20 mg/day, his nausea did not increase; however, after 6 months, he declined to take his pills as he experienced an 8 kg weight loss. For the next 3 years, he continued monthly apheresis but no lomitapide. We re-introduced lomitapide in November 2017 due to persistent LDL-cholesterol levels >500 mg/dl. However, this time he was compliant with the low-fat diet and lomitapide. He did not experience any adverse symptoms or weight loss with an up-titrated dose to 40 mg/day. No alteration was observed in transaminase levels, and a recent hepatic fibroscan was normal. We observed an additional 27% LDL-cholesterol reduction for a 5 mg daily dose of lomitapide at the end of the first month, which increased to 49% at the end of 6 months at a dose of 20 mg daily. The patient has been taking the current dose of lomitapide (40 mg/day) for almost 5 years and concomitant apheresis (every 2-3 months). During the pandemic, his access to apheresis was disturbed for 1 year; however, he maintained his lomitapide therapy. He also received supplementation with omega 3-6-9 and vitamin E. However, he reported several times reasons other than adverse effects for not being adherent to lomitapide therapy.

       "    'case_text': 'A 28-year-old female patient presented with a history of breathlessness on exertion and palpitation for 6 years. On examination, there was pansystolic murmur in the precordium. Her electrocardiogram was normal, and chest X-ray showed no cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed bileaflet prolapse with non-coaptation and posteriorly directed eccentric jet. Left atrium was dilated. Both the ventricles were normal in size and function. She was posted for mitral valve replacement. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed preoperative findings. There was a band like structure seen in the midcavity of left ventricle connecting the two walls (Figure: 1, Video: 1). Mitral valve replacement with 27ATS valve and false tendon (FT) excision was done under cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. However, postoperative TTE showed that the midcavity FT was still intact (Figure: 3). Retrospective interpretation of intra operative TEE images showed the presence of two false tendons. Along with first FT in LV mid-cavity (Figure: 1, Video: 1), a second FT was faintly seen below the mitral valve (Figure: 2, Video: 2) coursing towards the left ventricular outlet. Only the second FT was excised by the surgeon. The patient recovered from the surgery uneventfully.\\nFalse tendons are benign anatomic variants present in 40% of people. When LVFTs are oriented perpendicular to the flow of blood, they vibrate like the strings of an Aeolian harp. These vibrations are seen as fine fibrillations on M-mode images [Figure 3]. Patients with LVFTs are said to have violin heart as they frequently have musical systolic murmurs on precordial examination. Echocardiographically LVFTs can be differentiated from LV thrombus, LV hypertrophy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and trabeculations by the presence of echo-free space on both sides of the tendons. LVFTs have systolic laxity and become taut during diastole. LVFT may be cut by the surgeon as in our case or may rupture spontaneously or after an myocardial infarction, after percutaneous trans luminal mitral commissurotomy. Ruptured LVFT must be differentiated from ruptured chordae, vegetations or thrombi.\\nThe presence of LVFT carries both merits and demerits. Its presence can prevent left ventricular (LV) remodeling. However it may be a causative factor in the development of discrete subaortic stenosis (DSS)\\nLeft ventricular false tendons were first described by Sir Turner, a British anatomist and surgeon who proposed that they retard LV enlargement. In dilated cardiomyopathy or after myocardial infarction, LV dilates due to remodelling. Dilated ventricle increases wall stress and leads to LV failure. Increased wall stress also increases metalloproteinase activity that degrades myocardial extracellular matrix causing further LV dilatation. Transverse midcavity LVFTs absorb the distorting forces resulting in less remodelling, less mitral annular dilatation and LVEDD. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, Coapsys device (Myocor, inc) is utilized to reduce the LV wall stress. It is a flexible cord that is attached to the LV walls by epicardial pads and contains a cord that traverses the LV cavity anteroposteriorly. It is considered as a prosthetic false tendon. LVFT produces atrial natriuretic peptide(ANP) similar to left atrium when LV filling pressure are increased which promotes natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilatation resulting in reduced LV wall stress. ANP also retards LV remodelling by inhibiting endothelins, angiotensin-II and aldosterone, all of which promote cardiac fibrosis and remodelling. LVFT also produces ANP.\\nDilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy cause functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) by LV remodelling. The papillary muscles are displaced away from the mitral annulus as measured by tenting height and area. Incomplete mitral coaptation occurs due to the traction on the chordae tendinae. Coaptation device or surgical struts help to preserve the subvalvular anatomy and reduce the degree of FMR. In a study conducted by Bhatt et al., transversely oriented LVFTs were found to produce less FMR by having less coaptation depth and area.\\nLeft ventricular false tendons may contain Purkinje fibres, which have a gating mechanism that may inhibit or promote re-entry from ventricular tachycardia. In patients with dilated ventricles, conduction of the electrical impulse through LVFTs may produce a more homogenous LV depolarization similar to biventricular pacing and improve LV dP/dt.\\nThe presence of LVFTs in patients with DSS may add to the flow turbulence across the LVOT. Some surgeons excise LVFTs during DSS excision.\\nIn our patient, there were two false tendons, one was traversing LVOT and it was excised by the surgeon. The transverse midcavity tendon was left intact, which may protect the patient from future possibility of FMR. People with LVFTs may be at evolutionary advantage due to reduced LV remodelling after MI and reduced the degree of FMR.',\n",

Even after restarting diazoxide, the patient was inactive in the morning and blood glucose levels were unstable. Therefore, diazoxide was increased to 15 mg/kg/d. Cornstarch and frequent meals were started as a medical nutrition therapy. Despite the introduction of these treatments, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia persisted. We suspected the possibility of syndromic persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and consulted a medical geneticist for additional genetic analysis. Peripheral blood samples were collected, and DNA was extracted. Array comparative genome hybridization (CGH) was performed after obtaining informed consent using the SurePrint G3 Human CGH 4 x 180 K Microarray kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data were analyzed using the Agilent Cytogenomics software (ver 2.9) and the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed a 2.48-Mb deletion of chromosome 20p11.23-p11.21, which encompassed FOXA2 (Fig. 1).\\nA combined pituitary stimulation test was performed to evaluate pituitary function at 1 yr 8 mo because his growth rate declined after 11 mo of age, and hypopituitarism with deletion of chromosome 20p11 has been reported. GH stimulation tests revealed severe GHD (Table 2). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an ectopic posterior pituitary and pituitary stalk interruption (Fig. 2). Based on these results, GH replacement therapy was initiated at 0.175 mg/kg/wk. At this time, his physical appearance was characterized by a broad forehead and saddle nose that were not clear at birth. After GH replacement therapy, blood glucose levels were approximately 70 mg/dL in the morning fasting period, and his previously noted inactivity resolved.\",\n",

Hypesthetic hypopigmented macules were found on the right side of the back. (Figure 1) Sensory nerves examination revealed glove and stocking hypesthesia. Fingers and toes were swollen, without redness, warmth, and tenderness on the overlying skin. (Figure 2A) The range of motion was limited in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. Claw fingers, drop wrist, muscle atrophy, or contracture of the hands was not detected. Claw toes, drop foot, muscle atrophy, or contracture of the feet was not found. A slit-skin smear showed a bacterial index of 4.38+ (Figure 3) and a morphological index of 79%. We referred the patient to the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatology to perform synovial fluid aspiration from the interphalangeal joint of the hand (Figure 4A). Acid-fast staining of synovial fluid from the interphalangeal joint of the hand revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli (Figure 4B). Histopathological examination on a hypesthetic macule from the back showed epidermal atrophy with Grenz zone. The dermis was minimally infiltrated with lymphocytes and foamy histiocytes, which confirmed the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy. Radiographic features showed osteolysis and destruction of some phalanges of the hands, bone erosion and destruction of some phalanges of the feet, as well as destruction and subluxation of some hand joints (Figure 2B). These bone changes were concluded as osteomyelitis. The final diagnosis was lepromatous leprosy, osteomyelitis and chronic arthritis due to leprosy, with hand and foot deformities. The patient received multidrug therapy (MDT) for multibacillary (MB) leprosy. Improvements in swollen fingers and toes were observed within two months after the start of treatment.

The patient suffered from hypertension and he had a medical history of previous appendectomy and repair of umbilical hernia. Family history was negative for other diseases. He underwent an urgent contrast enhanced CT abdominal scan that showed a dilated stomach with hyperdense material of hematic nature in the lumen. At the level of the pyloric portion we found irregularly thickened walls associated with a small fluid collection and bubbles of free air (Fig. 1). These radiological and clinical findings appeared compatible with diagnosis of complicated peptic ulcer with covered perforation. Because of the worsening of the patient's clinical condition, we carried out an emergency surgery with distal gastrectomy for the large diameter and position of perforation. The procedure was performed by a young surgeon in urgent setting. We decided for a laparoscopic approach with pneumoperitoneum via trans-umbilical open Hasson technique. We used a 12-mm trocar in the left hypochondrium and other two 5-mm trocars respectively in the right flank and in xiphoid region. On exploratory laparoscopy we found a large perforation (about 5 cm of size) in the first duodenum portion (Fig. 2). We converted the procedure to open surgery in consideration of the extension and position of the lesion that did not allow us to continue safely in laparoscopy. We achieved a distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y side-to-side gastro-jejunostomy. The patients were satisfied with the treatment received, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on POD 7. The intraoperative findings appeared to be not unequivocal, configuring on the one hand the hypothesis of perforation on a large peptic ulcer or on a chronic pancreatitic process but we could not exclude the presence of a neoplasm by a gastro-duodenal origin. The histopathological examination described, 2 cm from the distal pyloric margin and in the context of the pyloric type mucosa, a centimetric neoformation with histological and immunophenotypic characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET G.1 s. WHO 2019 classification, Synaptofisina + and Chromogranina +). In the adjacent mucosa we saw multiple erosion/ulceration phenomena, with bleeding spillage and vascular congestion. The gastric wall was all affected by outbreaks of chronic inflammation, sometimes in follicular aggregation and with fibrosis also extended to the subserosa. These aspects, in relation to the presence of a NET G1 and multiple erosive/ulcerative areas near the pyloric margin, were suggestive of a clinical picture of Zollinger Ellison syndrome.\",\n",

He could not manage his work as a teacher, for example, creating tests and making decisions at school. Impairments appeared in his daily life activities, such as mistakes in transferring money through telebanking. He presented abnormal behavioral symptoms with an obsessive personality, for example, being stingy with money and also did not allow anyone to spend his money without prior discussions and permission. Patient did not have any medical disease prior to his cognitive decline, and family history was unremarkable since neither his parents nor his siblings showed any cognitive impairment or dementia so far. However, his 14-year-old daughter was mentally handicapped (Figure 1).\\nNeurologic examination did not reveal any focal or lateralizing neurologic deficit. Routine laboratory tests, including blood chemistry, electrolyte, and urine analyses, were normal. Serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) results, including those for Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPHA), were negative. Thyroid function tests were normal, as with vitamin B12 and folic acid levels. The patient\\'s apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was epsilon3/epsilon3. This patient was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria for \"probable AD\" by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer\\'s Disease and Related Disorder Association, which were ascertained by clinical features, neuropsycho-logical test, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Brain MRI revealed mild cortical atrophy without any ischemic change or other lesions (Figure 2A). Brain SPECT showed moderate hypoperfusion in the frontal, limbic, and temporal areas (Figure 2B). The reduced cerebral blood flow from the images of brain SPECT also supported the AD diagnosis.\\nThe patient underwent comprehensive neuropsychological tests, and he scored 23 out of 30 (2 percentile) on the mini-mental state examination. The subscores for time orientation and seven-serial calculations were 4 out of 5 and 1 out of 5, respectively. The delayed word recall score was 1 out of 3, and he scored 1 out of 3 in the task of clock drawing (Figure 3). His score fell in the abnormal range on the attention task of backward digit span (2.5 percentile). Significant impairment appeared in his confrontation naming ability (<0.01 percentile). Performances in copying the intersecting pentagon test and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test were normal, but his performances on clock drawing were severely impaired (5 percentile). On the Seoul verbal learning test, he was able to recall 13 items (0.02 percentile) in three consecutive immediate recall trials, but only 3 items (0.3 percentile) in the 20-minute delayed recall. Poor visual memory score of 10 out of 36 (1 percentile) was obtained in the delayed recall of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test. He showed abnormal performances in several tasks of frontal and executive functions, especially in the controlled oral word association test, Stroop test, and trail making test.\\nPatient was diagnosed as probable EOAD, based on clinical assessment, detailed neuropsychological tests, and neuroimaging studies including brain MRI and SPECT.\\nGenetic tests were performed in the patient to evaluate possible mutations. We were unable to make segregation analysis, since all family members and relatives refused the genetic test. The patient declined the genetic test for his children too. None of his family members presented any cognitive decline or dementia phenotypes, but they did not agree in releasing other family information. This patient was included in the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea study, which screened potential causative mutations in 100 patients with EOAD. Details of the clinical and scientific analyses of EOAD mutations in the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea study have not been included previously. A detailed clinical investigation of this patient with detailed personal interview, MRI, SPECT imaging data, and bioinformatic analyses are presented.\\nVenous blood samples (5 mL) were collected from the patient with an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood drawing tube. Blood sample was centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 5 min, followed by separation of white blood cells (buffy coat) for its storage at -80 C. DNA was purified using GeneAll Blood Protocol kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea), and purified DNA was kept at -20 C until the analysis.\\nA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis was performed using primers, as previously described. Targeted potential EOAD genes were as following: APP exons 16 and 17, PSEN1, and PSEN2. Since the diagnosis of EOAD is complicated due to the pathologic overlaps within diverse neurodegenerative disorders, this patient was also screened for progranulin (PGRN), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), and prion (PRNP) genes.\\nThe PCR products were purified using GeneAll Expin PCR kit (GeneAll Biotechnology). Single-strand conformation polymorphism was performed. Samples were mixed with formamide and incubated for 10 minutes at 95 C to generate single-stranded DNA bands. For separation, native polyacrylamide electrophoresis (BioRad, Seoul, Korea) was performed for 21 hours. SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) staining was used to visualize the DNA bands.\\nTo confirm the mutation, all PCR products were sequenced with the same primer sets in both directions by BioNeer Inc. (Dajeon, Korea). Before sequencing, we purified the PCR products by using GeneAll PCR kit (GeneAll Biotechnology). Big Dye Terminator Cyclic sequencing was performed with the ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (http://eng.bioneer.com/home.aspx; BioNeer Inc.). Sequencing data were screened with DNA BASER (http://www.dnabaser.com) software. Sequence variants were identified by NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) and UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org) databases.\\nMutations were analyzed by PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) online in silico prediction program, which predicted the pathogenic nature of missense mutations. PolyPhen-2 used homology search, multiple sequence alignment, profiling, identity-based scores, and structure-based search parameters (such as accessible surface area and hydrophobicity features). These predictions could define the putative role of missense variants and could predict whether they were probably/possibly damaging or benign. PolyPhen-2 also provided the multiple sequence alignment, which compared the homologous sequences from different organisms. Two types of datasets were used for the prediction: HumDiv and HumVar scores. HumDiv was used for testing the pathogenicty of rare alleles, where mildly damaging variants must be treated as possibly damaging. HumVar was used in case of Mendelian disorders, where more damaging alleles should be distinguished from the less damaging ones.\\nWe also analyzed the mutation with SIFT algorithm (http://sift.jcvi.org/), which used several databases such as SWISS-PROT, SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL, and NCBI Protein Database. The software analyzed the possibility on the pathogenic properties of mutations by comparing the mutant and normal variants. SIFT scores of point mutation were calculated for weighting the mutations as possibly damaging allele or tolerated (nondamaging), with a dividing score of 0.05, respectively.\\nProtein structure prediction analysis of PSEN2 was performed by Raptor X program at the University of Chicago (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu). Normal PSEN2 was composed of 488 amino acids, starting at 61 residues and continuing till residue 448. The prediction was performed at Raptor X web server for both normal PSEN2 and R62C mutation. Based on PSEN2 information from the UniProt database, R62C mutation belonged to the topological domain, positions 1-87, including the mutation site.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed turbid appearance, significantly high pressure (420 mmH2O), lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis (white blood cells 148/muL, lymphocytes 95/muL), reduced glucose (43 mg/dL), and elevated protein (519 mg/dL). The biochemistry assay was all normal, including sodium, which was 136 mmol/L. The CSF pathogen studies were negative in bacteria, syphilis, fungus, tuberculosis, and virus via multiple polymerase chain reaction (FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis). The viral serology surveys including varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and Japanese encephalitis virus were also negative. Serology detection for M. pneumoniae using rapid immunochromatographic test (Biocard  M. penunoniae IgM kit, Labsystems Diagnostics, Finland) showed IgM positive at a titer of 1:320 (normal value <1:40) on the 2nd admission day, indicating an acute M. pneumoniae infection.

A bone marrow biopsy showed a normocellular marrow with no apparent lymphoma cells. Genetic analysis of the bone marrow specimen showed no clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor Cbeta1 or the immunoglobulin heavy chain JH region gene. We took healthy-appearing skin randomly from the forearm, lower abdomen, and thigh for biopsy although no skin lesions were observed. All specimens revealed large B lymphoma cells within small veins and capillaries of the subcutaneous fat tissues but not outside the vessels (Figure 2A and B). Immunohistochemical studies showed that lymphoma cells were positive for CD20 (Figure 3), a B-cell marker, and negative for CD3, a T-cell marker. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of IVLBCL was made. The patient's poor general condition required a less toxic regimen, thus conventional R-CHOP therapy, consisting of rituximab (375 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), vincristine (1.4 mg/m2), and prednisolone (60 mg/m2), was started within 1 month of initial symptoms. After the first lumbar puncture for spinal fluid examination, the patient did not accept repeating it due to its invasiveness. For this reason, we treated the patient without any intrathecal treatment. After the first cycle of systemic chemotherapy, the patient had resolution of fever and peripheral edema, as well as improvement in Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, and sIL2-R levels. After eight cycles of R-CHOP therapy, the pontine lesion had completely disappeared (Figure 4A and B). Therefore, the asymptomatic reversible pontine lesion was considered as IVLBCL involvement. During follow-up, the value of sIL2-R had been within reference range. Currently at 5 years after diagnosis, the patient has been doing well with no recurrence and returned to work without any neurological disorders.\",\n",

She presented to our emergency department in acute respiratory distress of a few hour's duration.\\nHer preliminary clinical assessment revealed a distressed morbidly obese woman, unable to lie flat with a low oxygen saturation of 47% on room air. Her vital signs on presentation were: Temperature - 37.1 C; pulse - regular, 129 beat/min.; blood pressure (BP) - 130/88 mmHg; and respiratory rate - 35/min. Chest examination showed decreased air entry bilaterally with scattered crepitations and wheezes. Cardiovascular exam showed normal S1, S2 with mitral regurgitation murmur grade 4/6 heard loudest at left midclavicular fifth intercostals space radiating to the axilla. Jugular venous pressure (JVP) was distended. Her peripheries were edematous and cool, but good capillary refill. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. She had no focal neurological deficit.\\nChest X-ray showed diffuse pulmonary congestion. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without significant changes. An urgent echocardiography revealed an echogenic mass attached to the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve measuring 2.3 cm x 1.3 cm [Figure 1] with a pulmonary artery pressure of 44 mmHg. The repaired mitral valve was seen in situ with a mean gradient of 12 mmHg with a mild mitral regurgitation. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 60%.\\nHer initial laboratory investigations showed a leukocyte of 26.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin (Hb) - 11.3 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 75 mm/h, international normalized ratio (INR) - 3.28, urea - 14.4 mmol/l, creatinine: 288 mmol/l, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) - 23,300 IU. Multiple sets of blood cultures were sent.\\nThe patient was admitted for stabilization and initially managed conservatively as acute pulmonary edema secondary to acute prosthetic mitral valve thrombus. She was managed with antifailure medication and anticoagulation therapy with heparin.\\nDespite therapy, her clinical condition deteriorated with compromising hemodynamics requiring inotropes. A subsequent echocardiography further showed a severe mitral regurgitation jet. A decision for an emergency redo sternotomy and mitral valve replacement was taken. Intraoperative transesophegeal echocardiography confirmed an echogenic mass on the prosthetic mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation [Figure 2].\\nDuring surgery, the mitral valve was covered by an apparent layer of fibrinous tissue and old thrombi. There was a large mass on the ventricular surface of the mitral valve [Figure 3]. The annuloplasty ring was dehisced from the posterior leaflet annulus. The mass extended all along the posterior leaflet and was infiltrating into the annulus to the ventricular septal free wall. The valve was not suitable for repair. Full debridement was done and the valve was replaced with a CE Magna ease tissue valve, size 27 mm. She was sent back to cardiovascular intensive care unit (CICU) in a stable condition on minimal inotropic support.\\nIn CICU, empiric antimicrobial therapy (vancomycin and gentamycin) was initiated. A few days later, tissue valve culture report came back as Aspergillus fumigatus. Consequently, therapy was changed to intravenous voriconazole.\\nShe had a protracted, prolonged postoperative period complicated with acute on chronic renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy and subsequent upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was treated conservatively with proton pump inhibitors and blood transfusions. She was discharged in reasonably good condition and doing well afterward.\",\n",

She visited our hospital on the following day with bilateral blurred vision with meningismus. The patient's best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.5 in her right eye and 0.3 in her left eye. The patient had mild iridocyclitis in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed multi-focal serous retinal detachment (Figs. 1 and 2, day 2). The intraocular pressures were 18 mmHg (right eye) and 12 mmHg (left eye). B-scan ultrasonography was not performed, and choroidal thickness was unclear. The patient refused fluorescein angiography. Her blood pressure was 116/60. Based on these clinical findings and the revised criteria for diagnosis of VKH, she was diagnosed with incomplete VKH. We recommended the use of systemic high-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of VKH disease. However, the patient refused treatment because she was worried about adverse effects to the fetus. We therefore administered only topical ophthalmic betamethasone. Because she had rheumatoid arthritis, the patient had been receiving prednisolone 5 mg daily for the past 8 years. The patient had no history of any other medical disorders, including hypertension. She was a non-smoker and did not drink alcohol while pregnant. Her pregnancy had, up to this point, been uneventful. She underwent all routine laboratory and ultrasound tests, and the fetus had developed normally. Blood cortisol levels during pregnancy were not investigated.\\nOn 12 November 2013, the patient returned, presenting with progressive vision loss in both eyes that had begun 4 days earlier. The patient's BCVA was 0.3 in her right eye and 0.2 in her left eye. Ophthalmic examination revealed bullous retinal detachment in both eyes (Figs. 1 and 2, day 12). Intraocular pressures were 10 mmHg (right eye) and 11 mmHg (left eye). However, she continued to refuse treatment. At a subsequent visit on 19 November 2013, she reported visual improvement in both eyes. Ophthalmic examination on that day revealed the disappearance of subretinal fluid from both eyes (Figs. 1 and 2, day 19). Her BCVA was 0.8 in her right eye and 0.9 in her left eye. Intraocular pressures were 19 mmHg (right eye) and 16 mmHg (left eye). On 27 November 2013, she delivered a healthy female baby (gestational age 37 weeks and 5 days, 2294 g) by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The baby's birth weight was low, but not small for her gestational age. A subsequent examination on 1 April 2014 revealed that the patient's BCVA was 1.0 in both eyes, and examination of her fundus revealed typical sunset glow fundus, without subretinal fluid (Figs. 1 and 2, day 152). Intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg (right eye) and 10 mmHg (left eye). She exhibited alopecia and poliosis. After reviewing all of the patient's clinical findings, we diagnosed her with complete VKH. On 11 May 2015, our final meeting with the patient, she did not exhibit any recurrence of VKH. The patient was still receiving 5 mg prednisolone daily for rheumatoid arthritis. Prior to and during her pregnancy, the patient's blood pressure stayed within normal limits, and she never exhibited hypertension.\",\n",

A twelve-lead electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with non-specific ST-T changes; echocardiography performed two days previously revealed normal-sized ventricles, mild anterior hypokinesis, with normal wall motion, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.\\nA proposed plan of general endotracheal anesthesia, with invasive hemodynamic monitoring, was discussed with the patient; cell saver services, and four units of packed red cells, were made available for the surgery. After premedication with intravenous midazolam (2 mg), the patient was transferred to the operating suite; routine monitors revealed a baseline BP of 122 / 97 and normal sinus rhythm in the mid 60s. Following preoxygenation and induction with fentanyl (3 mcg / kg) and etomidate (0.2 mg / kg), endotracheal intubation was facilitated with cisatracurium (0.2 mg / kg); general anesthesia was maintained with oxygen : air (50 : 50), fentanyl, and isoflurane (0.4 - 0.8%).\\nAfter left radial artery catheter placement, a 7-Fr percutaneous sheath was introduced via the right internal jugular vein. Using waveform analysis, a balloon-tipped, flow-directed PA catheter was then slowly advanced through the sheath. Right atrial tracing, followed by right ventricular waveform, were duly noted until the catheter tip reached 55 cm, when the EKG monitor suddenly demonstrated asystole; systolic BP decreased precipitously from 110 to < 50 mmHg, and the arterial waveform disappeared. The PA catheter was immediately deflated and withdrawn completely, without any improvement. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated with chest compressions and intravenous administration of epinephrine (1 mg) and atropine (1 mg). The patient responded to this management in two to three minutes, with a quick return to sinus tachycardia, with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and ST-segment depression. An intraoperative cardiac consultation was obtained; the cardiologist recommended urgent cardiac catheterization and rescheduling of the surgical procedure.\\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where he continued to do well, and was extubated later that evening.

An 80-year-old gentleman was referred to our eye unit for assessment of bilateral cataract. His past medical history included type 2 diabetes and seropositive rheumatoid arthritis controlled by sulfasalazine. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/25 in the right eye (OD) and 20/50 in the left eye (OS). Slit-lamp examination showed bilateral grade 3 nuclear sclerotic cataract (based on the Lens Opacities Classification System III) with no other ocular abnormality detected. He underwent an uneventful phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implant and was started on topical prednisolone 1% TID, ketorolac 0.5% TID and chloramphenicol 0.5% TID postoperatively. Topical ketorolac was started postoperatively to reduce the risk of macular oedema after cataract surgery in view of the history of diabetes.\\nAfter 1 week, the patient presented to the eye emergency department with an acute left eye pain and hand movement vision. Slit-lamp examination showed a left inferior, noninfiltrated, crescentic corneal melt with epithelial defect, spanning 4-8 o'clock position (away from the temporal primary corneal incision), with a small Seidel-positive corneal perforation and flat anterior chamber. There was severe corneal punctate staining in the left eye and mild punctate staining in the right eye, suggestive of underlying DED. A left emergency corneal suturing and reformation of anterior chamber was performed. All postoperative drops, such as topical preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.2% Q2H, levofloxacin 0.5% Q2H and dexamethasone 0.1% BD, were discontinued. Oral prednisolone 40 mg was started in view of the possibility of peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with the underlying seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. On the next day, there was a mild persistent leak at the perforated site, which warranted a corneal gluing using cyanoacrylate glue (Histoacryl; B. Braun Medical Ltd, Sheffield, UK) and insertion of a bandage contact lens (BCL). Bilateral lower lid punctal plugs were inserted. Blood tests, including the inflammatory markers, were all normal. The oral prednisolone was stopped after 2 days as there was no convincing evidence of vasculitis or peripheral ulcerative keratitis and the corneal melt was likely attributed to DED. No flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis was reported.\\nAfter 1 week, the anterior chamber had successfully reformed. However, the corneal glue and BCL spontaneously dislodged after 2 weeks, resulting in a recurrent pinpoint corneal wound leak with iris plugging. He underwent a repeat corneal gluing and the eye stabilized within a week with a formed anterior chamber. CDVA was 20/50. The cornea successfully re-epithelialized under the glue 2 months later (Figure 1), and the BCL and glue were subsequently removed. The patient complained of ongoing grittiness and discomfort in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed mild meibomian gland dysfunction with right moderate and left severe inferior/central corneal punctate staining consistent with uncontrolled DED. The tear breakup time was 6 s, corneal sensation was normal and Schirmer's test (with topical anaesthesia) was 0 mm/5 min in both eyes. All the inflammatory and serologic markers for Sjogren's syndrome were negative, except for a moderately raised rheumatoid factor (53.1 IU/ml; normal: 0-14). Topical preservative-free sodium hyaluronate 0.2% Q2H, lacrilube nocte, cyclosporine 0.1% nocte and an 8-week tapering regime of prednisolone 0.5%, starting from QID, were given. Bilateral lower lid punctal plugs were re-inserted. Two years after cataract surgery, the DED had improved significantly, with the left eye remaining settled with an inferior corneal scar (Figure 2a and b) and a CDVA of 20/30 (-3.25/+3.75 x 70).\",\n",

The CYP21A2 gene, encoding for the 21-hydroxylase enzyme, was PCR amplified in two segments as described by Ohlsson and Schwartz using Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannnheim). PCR products were visualized on a 1% ethidium bromide stained agarose gel and purified with JET quick from Genomed. The two segments were sequenced in both directions, using an Applied Biosystems 310 automated DNA sequencer ABI Prism and BigDyeTM terminator Cycle sequencing Ready Reaction Kit from AB Applied Biosystems, according to the manufacturer's specifications. The obtained sequences were compared to the normal sequence, and in the patient 2 mutations were found: R132C in exon 3 and R339H in exon 8 (Figure 2). The observed mutations were confirmed by resequencing (R132C) or by restriction analysis (R339H). A PCR product of 296 bp was obtained by the following primers: R339H-F: 5'-TTGCTGAGGGAGCGGCTGGA, and R339H-R: 5'-AGCCTAGACACCCCTGGGTT, spanning the site of the R339H mutation. The mutation destroys a ApaI restriction site, while the normal sequence is cut into two fragments of 144 + 153 bp. The normal sequence has a ApaI site 144 + 152 bp. Restriction of the PCR product from the patient confirmed the heterozygosity, showing both 296 (mutant) + 144 + 152 (wild-type) (Figure 3). The mother was heterozygous for the R132C mutation, but did not carry the R339H mutation.\",\n",

From May 2013 to December 2014, the patient was treated with erlotinib hydrochloride targeted therapy, two regimens of chemotherapy, and thoracic radiation therapy at a dose of 4,020 cGy/5 f/1 wk. In March 2015, disease progression was observed in the left lung and humerus lesions; thus, radiotherapy was administered at a dose of 3,600 cGy/12 f/3 wk. In July 2015, he was transferred to our hospital. Further examinations, including nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of his head, pathological examination, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography were conducted, showing multiple metastases in his brain, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, adrenal gland, and humerus (Figure 1A-E). A pathological analysis of the liver biopsy revealed a moderate-low differentiation squamous cell carcinoma with necrosis. The tumor exhibited the following immunohistochemical characteristics: CK5(+), p40(+), CK7(-), CK20(-), TTF-1(-), Napsin A(-), CDX2(-), CK19(+), and GPC3(-).\\nAfter integrated consideration and informed consent, we concluded that palliative treatment was appropriate. Anti-PD-1 antibody was a suitable choice. At the request of the patient for further treatment, we administered nivolumab, in an effort to control the advanced disease and prolong survival and quality of life. Nivolumab was administered at 3 mg/kg for 1 hour, once every 2 weeks, as a total of three infusions from August 6, 2015, to September 4, 2015. On the second day after the first infusion, the patient developed an intermittent fever, with a maximum body temperature of 39.6 C, and the routine blood examination showed that his white blood cell count had increased to 15.72x109/L with 96.8% neutrophil granulocytes and the C-reactive protein had elevated to 156 mg/L, which indicated a severe infection (grade 3, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0). Bacterial and fungal cultures of sputum showed Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans infections. Then, meropenem (0.5 g q8h) and fluconazole (200 mg qd) were administered intravenously on August 8, according to drug sensitivity tests. After treatment with antibiotics, further bacterial and fungal cultures of sputum were conducted on August 16 and were negative for A. baumannii and C. albicans. The white blood cell count had decreased to 9.0x109/L and the C-reactive protein had dropped to 65 mg/L, suggesting that the infection was controlled. As a result, meropenem and fluconazole infusions were discontinued. Subsequently, the patient had a fever every other day, which was relieved each time by administration of dexamethasone. He experienced mild hemoptysis of ~10 mL of blood on September 11 and slightly blood-stained sputum on the following 3 days. We gave him hemostasis and coagulation. Moreover, the patient had a progressive aggravation of thrombocytopenia (platelet count dropped to 28x109/L), although it was normal before the therapy. Chills, cough, sputum expectoration, and shortness of breath were observed after each antibody infusion. These symptoms were alleviated through anti-infection therapy with meropenem and fluconazole, as well as dexamethasone. A chest computed tomography examination revealed that the treatment was effective and the lung lesions had shrunk after the therapy (Figure 1F), but the patient passed away on September 26 without other severe symptoms.\\nCellular immunity was monitored during the treatment. The proportion of lymphocyte (Lym) subpopulations, including T, B, natural killer (NK), regulatory T (Treg), cytotoxic T Lym (CTL; CD3+CD8+CD28+), and suppressor T Lym (Ts; CD3+CD8+CD28-), and the expression of several immunoregulatory molecules (inhibition and activation), including CD25, CD28, CTLA-4, PD-1, Foxp3, TGF-beta, and IL-10 in the peripheral blood, were analyzed (Figure 2A and B). Of the Lym proportions, NK cells and Ts were significantly upregulated and CTLs were moderately downregulated, whereas the other Lyms did not vary notably during the observation. The expression of CD25, CD28, CTLA-4, PD-1, and IL-10, but not of Foxp3 and TGF-beta, reduced after the first infusion and then rebounded sharply after the second infusion.

The patient complained of paroxysmal falls accompanied by impaired consciousness for the last nine days and paroxysmal limb twitch accompanied by gibberish speech for four days. Initially, the patient experienced tonic-clonic seizures, accompanied by impaired consciousness. Later, the patient experienced tonic seizures with head turning to the right and retained consciousness similar to faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) (Supplementary Materials S1). These incidences occurred more than ten times in a day. The patient was first seen in another hospital, and a brain MRI was done. The MRI showed no abnormalities. The patient was started on sodium valproate, diazepam, and levetiracetam (drug doses unknown). Due to no clinical improvement, the patient was referred for further management. The patient had no previous history of hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, mental illness, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and no family history of any hereditary disease.\\nOn admission, the patient had a body temperature of 36.3 C, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a blood pressure of 162/85 mmHg. The neurological assessment revealed that the patient had cognitive dysfunction (poor memory and poor calculation ability). However, other categories of the neurological examination, including cranial nerves, motor system, reflexes, sensation, coordination, movement, gait, and signs of meningeal irritation, were normal.\\nThe serum testing of routine blood tests, coagulation profile, liver function and kidney function tests, blood sugars, lipid profile, and serological testing for hepatitis B, syphilis, and HIV were negative. In addition, the results of anti-nuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factors, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, and serum tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, cytokeratin-19 fragment, carbohydrate antigen 199, carbohydrate antigen 125, and neuron-specific enolase were normal. The patient had abnormal serum chloride levels of 95mmol/L. Further, the serum AE-related antibodies determined with both tissue-based and cell-based indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay in V-Medical Laboratory (Guangzhou, China), including anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), anti-gamma-aminobutyric-acid B receptor (GABABR), anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX), and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS)-related antibodies including anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Yo, anti-Ma2, anti-CV2, and anti-amphiphysin, was remarkable only for positive anti-LGI1 antibody with a titer of 1:16 (normal <1:10). The CSF showed slight leukocytosis of 10 x 106 / L with lymphocytic predominance. However, the pressure, color, turbidity, glucose levels, chloride levels, Gram staining, acid-fast staining, ink staining, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), AE-related antibodies which were also determined with both tissue-based and cell-based IIF assay in V-Medical Laboratory (Guangzhou, China), and PNS-related antibodies of the CSF were normal. The patient had a positive RPR with a serum titer of 1:16 and a positive TPPA. Subsequently, TPPA and RPR in CSF were tested, and both results were positive.\\nThe electroencephalography (EEG)showed irregular slow waves with medium to high amplitudes in the right temporal lobe, which spread to the other lobes and showed sharp waves (Figure 1). The brain MRI showed increased signals on T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging in the medial temporal lobe (Figure 2A). The gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain showed mild to moderate cord enhancement in the right temporal lobe (Figure 2B). Syphilis can cause multiple system damage. Therefore, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was carried out to investigate vascular stenosis or vasculitis-like changes. However, the results revealed no abnormalities (Figure 2C). Moreover, CT of the chest, echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound, urinary tract ultrasound, electromyography, and nerve conduction velocities of the limbs were normal.\\nTherefore, uncertainty arose as to whether the patient had both anti-LGI1 encephalitis and NS or whether the LGI1 antibody and LE manifestations were due to the NS. The patient received intravenous penicillin sodium 3.5 million units every 4 h for 14 days to treat the NS. Furthermore, the patient was initiated on intravenous sodium valproate 400 mg two times daily and oral levetiracetam 500 mg two times daily. The drugs were then changed to oral sodium valproate 500 mg two times daily and oral levetiracetam 750 mg two times daily. Improvement was noted with no convulsions and normal cognitive function. Two months later, the serum TPPA was still positive. In addition, the serum RPR was still positive with a titer of 1:8, while the serum LGI1 antibody was positive with a titer of 1:10. Furthermore, a revaluation of the CSF showed that the CSF TPPA and RPR were positive. However, the other CSF tests remained negative. In addition, a repeat of the EEG showed no epileptiform wave emission (Figure 3). Moreover, a repeat of the brain MRI showed no abnormality (Figure 2D). A second course of intravenous penicillin G sodium 3.2 million units every 4 h for 14 days was started. After another four months, the serum TPPA was still positive, the serum RPR test was positive with a titer of 1:8, while the serum LGI1 antibody was negative. Changes in TPPA, RPR, and LGI1 antibodies during the syphilitic treatment are shown in Figure 4. A repeat of the EEG and brain MRI showed normal findings. The third course of intravenous penicillin G sodium 3.2 million units every four hours, was given for 14 days. In addition, oral doses of sodium valproate 500 mg two times daily and levetiracetam 750 mg two times daily were continued. The patient was then followed up for additional three months. The patient reported no further convulsive episodes. In addition, the memory and calculation ability were noted to be normal.',\n",

An ultrasound (USS) scan was performed at 11 weeks gestation to exclude an ectopic pregnancy, which demonstrated a singleton viable intrauterine pregnancy with 2 small cervical fibroids (<4 cm) and a small amount of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas (Figure 1). A diagnosis of fibroid red cell degeneration was determined as an explanation for the abdominal pain. A routine anomaly USS was performed at 20 weeks which was unremarkable (Figure 2).\\nDue to ongoing episodes of abdominal pain, an abdominal USS was performed at 21 + 4 weeks gestation which demonstrated normal abdominal and pelvic organs and an intrauterine gestation with anhydramnios. On referral to the obstetric team, a bedside USS performed was unable to identify the fetus.\\nA subsequent USS was performed in the fetal medicine unit, which proved challenging due to severe oligohydramnios and uterine fibroids. The fetus could be identified and was noted to be lying laterally in the pelvis.\\nInitial management for preterm rupture of membranes was implemented; however, an USS 2 days later demonstrated an empty uterus with the fetus situated near the liver.\\nThe patient was referred for an urgent MRI which confirmed the diagnosis of suspected abdominal pregnancy (Figure 3).\\nThe patient was transferred to a tertiary center for specialist multidisciplinary management at 22 + 1 weeks gestation, with access to interventional radiology services. She was extensively counselled regarding her options for conservative management or surgical termination of the pregnancy. This included discussions with the neonatal team regarding fetal outcomes at extreme prematurity as well as obstetric and anesthetic input regarding maternal risk of major hemorrhage. The patient remained committed to the pregnancy and was admitted for observation.\\nAt 24 + 4 weeks gestation, the patient collapsed with clinical signs of acute intraabdominal bleeding. A laparotomy performed revealed 2 liters of hemoperitoneum. The placenta was embedded at the left cornua, continuous with the left fallopian tube and ovary, and adherent to the omentum.\\nThe baby was identified extrauterine and delivered alive but in poor condition. Placental tissue continued within the myometrium; therefore, the left cornua were excised and the uterus repaired, with a blood loss of 4000 ml.

The patient had a cough occasionally and joint soreness but denied any other symptoms. On initial clinical evaluation, the patient's body temperature was 38.4  C, and other signs were within normal limits. Pulmonary, abdominal, cardiac, and neurologic examinations showed unremarkable findings. Laboratory tests revealed that the patient had leukocytosis (20.72 x 109/ml) with 87.4% neutrophils. His C-reactive protein level was high (90.61 mg/L), and a procalcitonin level was slightly increased (0.173 ng/ml). Contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed a large mediastinal mass measuring approximately 7.76 x 4.55 cm (Figure 1A). The rest of the examination was regular.\\nAt initial admission, the patient was treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, including piperacillin and sulbactam. However, he still had a recurrent fever, and there was no significant improvement in inflammatory indicators and blood routine examination. To determine the etiology, the patient underwent Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) on the fifth day of admission. The Virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) system is a method to guide the bronchoscope to the lesion by making a bronchial path on a virtual image. The digitized information from the patient's CT scan was imported into the Archimedes VBN system, in which multislice views of the chest and virtual bronchoscopy images were reconstructed. The VBN system shows the bronchial tree, the anatomical structure of the mediastinal mass and visualizes the best path to reach the mediastinal mass (Figures 2A-E). With the guidance of the VBN system, the bronchoscope was navigated to the target bronchus and advanced to the lesion, and then EBUS-TBNA was performed to obtain purulent exudate (Figures 3A-D). Biopsy showed more purulent secretions and a few lymphocytes and macrophages (Figure 4A). Microscopic analysis revealed numerous weakly acid-fast and branching filamentous rod bacteria were identified from the samples on the aspirate smear, and a presumptive microbiological diagnosis (Nocardia) was made (Figure 4B). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) subsequently identified the pathogens as Nocardia species (Nocardia arizonensis and Nocardia cyriacigeorgica). And after seven days of culture, the cultures of purulent exudates ultimately grew the Nocardia species (Figure 4C).\\nAfter microscopic examination and mNGS confirmed Nocardia, intravenous imipenem/amikacin was given.

The cancer recurred in 2015 and the patient underwent right total maxillectomy including resection of the right orbital floor with reconstruction, and right neck dissection. She was staged as pT3N0 with positive margins and perineural invasion. PD-L1 tested in the primary tumor by IHC (using Dako 22C3 pharmaDx antibodies) was 70% by tumor proportion score. Tumor DNA analysis by the FoundationOne platform (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA) measured a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 9, two TP53 mutations and a BRCA1 mutation, among others (Figure 1(c)). Genetic evaluation was negative for any inherited genetic abnormalities.\\nFollowing surgery, she underwent adjuvant radiochemotherapy with 66 Gray and weekly cisplatin. Follow-up imaging demonstrated progression of metastatic cancer with lesions in the mediastinum, lung, and liver. The patient started palliative chemotherapy with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel but progressed after 6 months with increased number and size of the metastases including a 3.5 cm mediastinal mass, a 3.8 cm left lower lobe (LLL) mass, and multiple liver masses measuring up to 5 cm (Figure 1A). Given her recurrent and metastatic status with progression on a platinum-based regimen, she was recommended palliative treatment with single-agent pembrolizumab (given at a dosage of 200 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) and began treatment in October 2016.\\nAfter the third administration of pembrolizumab, the patient presented to an outside hospital with a vesicular skin rash associated with severe neuropathic pain and pruritis of the left lower extremity from the thigh down to the shin in a L4-L5 dermatomal distribution. The patient was not vaccinated against herpes zoster virus (HZV). Given the typical clinical presentation (unilateral vesicular skin rash in a restricted dermatomal pattern associated with severe neuritis), the patient was diagnosed with herpes zoster infection and was prescribed valacyclovir. After 7 days of treatment, the skin lesions and pain continued leading to extension of valacyclovir treatment. Given the acute viral infection, pembrolizumab was held. The vesicles gradually improved, but the patient had persistent pain and ultimately developed new open wounds. She was admitted in the hospital where Infectious Disease and Dermatology services were consulted. A biopsy was performed, which was consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. This was considered to be an isomorphic reaction related to the previous zoster infection. The patient was started on treatment with prednisone. She gradually recovered and prednisone was tapered over 2 months.\\nFollow-up computed tomography (CT) scans performed 1 month after the diagnosis of herpes zoster infection (going along with discontinuation of pembrolizumab application) showed improvement in all targeted metastatic lesions. At this time, the mediastinal mass measured 2.7 cm, the LLL mass was replaced with an area of consolidation, and the liver lesions sizes decreased with the largest now measuring 1.7 cm (Figure 1(a)). After another 4 months, the skin lesions healed, and plans were made to resume immunotherapy due to concerns for tumor progression during the long treatment break. Repeated imaging, however, demonstrated stable tumor disease, and as the patient was recovering with limited performance status, resumption of ICI treatment was paused in favor of close imaging monitoring.\\nFollow-up CT scans were obtained after another 3 months and demonstrated further decreased sizes of the lung and liver lesions and no measurable disease in the mediastinum or LLL. At this time, the largest liver lesion measured 1.1 cm. On this basis, the decision was made to continue active surveillance and resume treatment only upon progression. From then on, imaging was repeated every 3-4 months, and at the 1-year post-treatment scans a complete disappearance of mediastinal and liver lesions was observed, beyond that the residual LLL lesion was considered atelectatic.\\nIn February 2019, concerns for recurrence in the LLL were raised due to the increase in size of the lung lesion with increased metabolic activity on a positron emission tomography scan. However, the patient still was completely asymptomatic. Two lung biopsies, one transbronchial and one transthoracic, were found to be completely negative for tumor cells; on the contrary, only signs of an acute inflammation (first biopsy) as well as a chronic inflammation (second biopsy) were detected. Further follow-up imaging showed that the lung lesion decreased in size to baseline, and the associated metabolic activity had resolved spontaneously. The patient remains in complete imaging remission to date, now 5-year post-treatment (Figure 1(a)). Circulating tumor mutations have been monitored using the Guardant360 platform (Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA, USA) over the last 4 years and the patient continues to present a circulating TP53 clone, although the percentage has been slowly decreasing (Figure 1(b)).',\n",

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 47 mm/hr, C-reactive protein was 1.8 mg/dL, beta-2 microglobulin was 3.1 mg/L (0-3 mg/L), C3 was 139 mg/dL, and C4 was 18.8 mg/dL (20-47 mg/dL). Serum cryoglobulins were present at 14%. Quantitative serum immunoglobulin testing showed an elevated IgM of 1770 mg/dL, and serum viscosity was normal at 1.56. A skin punch biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with cryoglobulin deposits (Figure 1). Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was normal as was a bone marrow aspirate.\\nTreatment for presumed essential mixed cryoglobulinemia with oral prednisone 40 mg and azathioprine 150 mg daily resulted in only a partial response, and attempts at tapering steroids were unsuccessful. The lack of response after two months of therapy prompted further testing including a serum protein electrophoresis which revealed an IgM kappa monoclonal gammopathy (0.7 gm/dL). Electrophoresis of the cryoglobulin precipitate was then performed which revealed an IgM kappa monoclonal gammopathy (5.98 gm/dL) consistent with type 1 cryoglobulinemia. At our request, a repeat bone marrow aspiration was performed which demonstrated a 1% abnormal population of monoclonal B cells consistent with early Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Treatment with four weekly doses of rituximab 500 mg IV resulted in a gradual resolution of the rash coupled with a decreased IgM kappa to 0.2 gm/dL within three months, and prednisone was subsequently tapered off.\\nAfter six months of remission, macules reappeared on the lower extremities but did not respond to a second course rituximab and steroids. Other unsuccessful therapies included methotrexate, two cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 IV, and a combination of melphalan, thalidomide, and prednisone. After being lost to follow up for one year, he was admitted with lower extremity ulcerations secondary to worsening cutaneous vasculitis and received solumedrol 80 mg IV daily plus plasmapheresis. Quantitative cryoglobulins decreased from 17.5% to 2%, and the patient improved clinically. Anticoagulation was also initiated for a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. He was readmitted eight months later for infected cutaneous ulcers and severe sepsis that necessitated intravenous antibiotics and surgical debridement. As a result of sepsis, he developed new-onset renal failure requiring chronic dialysis. Presently, the patient continues to receive periodic plasmapheresis for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 65-year-old male, with a past medical history of glaucoma, cataract, squamous cell carcinoma of the right eyelid, hyperplastic polyp and hyperlipidemia, was diagnosed with Rai stage 0 CLL by absolute monotypic B-cell lymphocytosis >5 x 109/L on normal peripheral flow cytometry, in the year 2000. He did not have any high-risk markers, with CD38 negative disease that showed del 13q on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and normal beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). He remained asymptomatic and under observation for several years but was noted to have rapidly increasing lymphocytosis, progressive lymphadenopathy, symptomatic splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in 2015 (Table 1 and Figure 1). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular marrow with diffuse involvement by lambda light chain-restricted small lymphocytes occupying 95% of the marrow space. First-line treatment was planned with obinutuzumab (1000 mg) and chlorambucil as per standard guidelines but the patient never started chlorambucil due initially to a concern of tumor lysis syndrome from significant disease burden, and later due to development of prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia on obinutuzumab alone. The dose of obinutuzumab was reduced by 20% for cycle 4 and he was given daily G-CSF for three days after the obinutuzumab dose for that cycle only. After completion of six planned cycles of single-agent obinutuzumab, the patient achieved partial response (PR) to therapy as measured by greater than 50% reduction in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and splenomegaly as well as a platelet level greater than 100 x 109/L, as per iwCLL guidelines. Disease was detectable as minimal residual disease (MRD) only, by CLL specific MRD peripheral flow cytometry 0.37%, 2 months after completion of treatment, without residual blood, spleen or lymphadenopathy detected. His CLL remained stable over the next 2 years with only slight increase in lymphocytosis. Approximately two-and-a-half years after initial treatment, thrombocytopenia and rapid increase in lymphocytosis were noted (Table 1 and Figure 1).\\nA repeat flow cytometry confirmed monoclonal B-cell population along with an upward trending ALC, confirming disease relapse. A repeat FISH once again showed a 13q deletion. Retreatment was initiated due to worsening fatigue and concern for infections as Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was trending downward. After discussing several treatment options, a shared decision of reintroducing obinutuzumab was taken based on the prolonged initial response of over 2 years with this as a single agent. Lymphocyte count normalized after only one cycle of retreatment and the patient eventually achieved partial response again per the same iwCLL guidelines. Grade 2 IRR was noted at initial treatment but not at retreatment while grade 2 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were noted at initial as well as retreatment with obinutuzumab. The patient continues to follow up 1 year after the relapse for surveillance and provided informed consent for reporting.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'At the Wild Animal Park Planckendael of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp, an adult, male Asiatic lion, 2.7 years old, was found dead in his inside enclosure without preceding clinical abnormalities. Gross post-mortem examination revealed a normal body condition with a body weight of 140 kg and the following salient findings: anaemic mucosae; 10 litres of blood in the abdominal cavity; pale-coloured pancreas and spleen; multiple nodular lung masses (a few mm to 10 cm diameter, filled with blood clots) (Fig. 1); multiple (2 mm - 8 mm diameter) kidney cysts (filled with clear transparent liquid); multiple liver nodules (a few mm to 10 cm diameter, filled with blood clots, some with grapelike appearance, others were ruptured) (Fig. 2). An additional macroscopic finding, i.e. an extensive proximal diaphyseal new bone formation on the right humerus, was identified later after the preparation of the skeleton at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. No anomalies were detected in any other organ.\\nA set of tissue samples (liver, lung, spleen, kidney, bronchial lymph node) was collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 mum, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Prussian blue for histologic examination. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-mum sections using Factor VIII-related antigen or von Willebrand factor (vWf) (polyclonal rabbit antibody, reference A0082, Dako, Glostrop, Denmark) and the platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule or cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) (monoclonal mouse antibody, Clone JC70A, reference M0823, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). External positive controls for the immunohistochemical stainings were spleen from a pig for vWf and mesenteric blood vessels from a dog for CD31. Internal controls consisted of normal endothelial cells in the examined tissues. No non-specific staining was observed in any of the slides.\\nIn the liver, there were multifocal areas where the normal architecture was lost and most of the parenchyma had been replaced by non-encapsulated, poorly demarcated, infiltrative and moderately cellular masses. The masses were composed of loosely arranged streams and poorly defined capillary-like channels, supported by a moderate amount of eosinophilic stroma and occasionally large vascular channels, filled with variable amounts of blood (Fig. 3a). Neoplastic cells were mainly polygonal to spindle shaped, with indistinct cell borders, moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with a round to oval, centrally placed nucleus with a finely stippled chromatin pattern and 1 nucleolus. There was moderate anisokaryosis and anisocytosis. Mitotic figures ranged from 1 to 4 per high power field. There were larger areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. The neoplastic cells labelled strongly positive for vWf and CD31 (Fig. 3b). In the lung similar neoplastic foci were observed, which also labelled positive for vWf and CD31. There was mild fibrosis of the renal capsule. There were no neoplastic lesions in the kidney. The capsule of the spleen showed focal mesothelial cell proliferation without signs of neoplastic masses in the spleen. In the bronchial lymph node, and especially in its subcapsular sinuses, there was a multifocal mild infiltration of macrophages. Many of those macrophages had an intracytoplasmic accumulation of a yellowish-brown granular pigment. Prussian blue staining confirmed the pigment as haemosiderin. Other macrophages showed erythrophagocytosis. The lesion in the humerus, detected during the preparation of the skeleton, was not examined histopathologically.\\nTissue impression smears of bronchial lymph node, liver, lung and also of the abdominal blood were made for bacteriological examinations. Giemsa stain, Gram stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain were all negative. Cultivation on tryptone-soya-agar and blood agar demonstrated no growth of bacteria.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A woman about 30 years old, with no systematic health issues and non-smoker, consulted the Odontology Department of University Hospital Center of Montpellier (Montpellier, France) to manage aesthetic damages due to congenital missing lateral incisors. After being well informed of every alternative treatment, the patient consented to be treated with an orthodontic treatment associated with delayed implant fixed crowns and provided written informed consent.\\nTreatment initially involved mesializing the canines to open up the spaces and reshaping the cuspids with ameloplastia. The choice of opening spaces was required after an accurate clinical radiographic analysis. Indeed, the patient presented several diastemas as well as a mesioposition of canines before orthodontic treatment (Figure 1). In addition, the patient had asymmetry in her wisdom teeth with agenesis of tooth number 16, therefore, excluding the possibility of mesialising molars (Figure 2). Finally, the cephalometric analysis showed a skeletal Class III (angle ANB = 1 ) as well as a normodivergence with a tendency to hypodivergence (angle FMA = 23 ) (Figure 3). Because of the sagittal skeletal relationships, the solution of opening spaces was selected. Mediation of the canines in place of lateral incisors was performed, and canines were rehabilitated with implants. This solution does not accentuate the negative overjet already present in Class III patients. A 2-year multibracket orthodontic treatment in the vestibule area closed the diastemas by repositioning the incisors with maximum bimaxillary anchorage.\\nAt the end of the orthodontic treatment, prosthetic and bone spaces were sufficient for the placement of 6 and 11 implants. A subtractive coronoplasty was realized to make up the canines as lateral incisors. During this treatment, lingual rehabilitation was performed to perpetuate the results. Ultimately, a retention was performed to maintain the spaces before the implants were placed. At the end of the orthodontic treatment, patient was addressed to the Implantology Department to restore edentulous spaces with implant-supported crowns.\\nUpon extraoral examination, the patient presented an average smile line with visibility of her interdental papilla and partial edentulous spaces in canine area (Figure 4).\\nOn intraoral examination, a healthy periodontal status with a thick maxillary phenotype presenting gingival pigmentations was observed. Restorative spaces were about 7.5 mm and were maintained with fixed retainers and maxillary removable resin injected retainer in canine area (Figure 5).\\nRegarding the panoramic radiography realized at the end of the orthodontic treatment, canines\\' root axes were divergent, reducing mesiodistal bone space. But root axes were parallel to bicuspid ones, making the implant placement easier (Figure 6).\\nA pre-operative computed tomography was performed to analyze ridge dimensions for implant placement surgery. The mesiodistal bone spaces were about 7 mm in canine position 6 and 6 mm in position 11. On both sides, alveolar crest was narrow (7 mm) and presented a buccal undercut (Figure 7).\\nThe patient, with no contraindications to surgery, was informed that a ridge augmentation could be necessary during the surgical phase to avoid vestibular fenestration, and narrow implants have been chosen to fit the ridge width and maintain a minimum of 1.5 mm peripheric bone around implant.\\nImpressions of the maxilla and mandible with irreversible hydrocolloid (Alginoplast , Kulzer Mitsu Chemicals Groups, Hanau, Germany) were practiced, and the diagnostic setup for the final restoration was made in order to prepare a composite injected resin tray as interim restoration (Figure 8). Careful attention was taken to maintain space between gingiva and tray, in order to avoid healing interactions.\\nDuring surgery, full thickness flap was raised, and two implants were placed with an insertion torque of more than 30 N cm (3.1 x 10 mm; Eztetic , Zimmer Biomet, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA) on the region of teeth numbers 6 and 11. Because of the underestimated alveolar ridge dimension visualized on the computed tomography, guided bone regenerations were not indicated and vestibular fenestration have been avoided. Surgical healing screw (CCNSP, Zimmer Biomet, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA) was placed on each implant, and operative sites were primarily closed using resorbable sutures 4.0 (Vicryl , Ethicon) (Figure 9).\\nResin tray immediate interim rehabilitation was placed to ensure patient\\'s cosmetic satisfaction and maintain edentulous space during early healing process (D + 15). After that, a removable partial denture was placed for 3 months, until osseointegration.\\nMucogingival management during second stage implant surgery was performed after osseointegration, and healing collars were placed at the same time (CHCNP33, Zimmer Biomet, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA).\\nBecause of a lack of keratinized tissue (KT) around implant number 6, a connective tissue graft using envelope flap technique was performed in this site using crestal harvesting to avoid changing gingival pigmentations (Figures 10 and 11).\\nIn implant site number 11, a simple incision allowed the placement of the healing collar. The two surgeries were practiced at the same time, and control visits were realized at 2 weeks and 3 weeks (Figures 11, 12, and 13).\\nAt D + 21 after second stage implant surgery, the maxilla was impressed using open-tray procedure and dual-mix technique with silicones of different viscosities. First, healing collars were removed, and direct transfers were placed using retaining screw (CHCNP33, Zimmer Biomet, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA). Then, light silicone was charged around transfers, and a tray filled with heavy silicone was inserted in the upper jaw. After impression time, transfers were unscrewed and trial disinserted. Finally, implant analogs (CIANP, Zimmer Biomet, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, USA) were screwed to direct transfers into the impression. The mandible impression was classically realized with irreversible hydrocolloid (Alginoplast , Kulzer Mitsu Chemicals Groups, Hanau, Germany). Occlusion cire and teeth color were finally recorded, and information were sent to the laboratory.\\nTemporary implant directly fixed crows were tried, and occlusion was adjusted in order to obtain canine guidance in lateral movement but no interdental contact in static occlusion (Figure 14). With these temporary crowns, patient had function and aesthetic rehabilitation, and profile emergence was modeled with resin adjunction for the future definitive crowns (Figure 15).\\nAfter orthodontic treatment, the patient was complaining about teeth color, with a \"yellow\" aspect. A step of at-home tooth bleaching was performed between temporary and definitive restoration and using 10% carbamide peroxide with adaptable trays (Polanight , SDI).\\nTeeth color was visually measured by the patient and clinicians: the initial teeth color was 3M2 (Figure 16) and after 7 days of overnight at-home bleaching, the final teeth color was 2M2 (Vita 3D-Master , Vita) (Figure 17). Patient was satisfied by the aspect of her teeth, more luminous and less saturated. The bleaching treatment was continued for one more week, and tint stabilization was reached at 1 month, allowing final implant fixed restoration in positions 6 and 11.\\nOnce soft tissue has matured and teeth color was stabilized, final implant fixed crowns have been realized. Impression technique was similar to the interim phase except the first step. In fact, a record of the emergence profile was made using flowable resin on the direct transfer (Figure 18).\\nDue to the available prosthetic height, individualized milled direct-implant frameworks were made (Zfx, Germany, company of the ZimVie Group) (Figure 19). They allow better management of the emergence profile and passivity, compared to a conventional cast framework or standardized abutment. The coping and the implant abutment are then one piece, reducing the risk of gaps between the different components.\\nThe crowns were tried before finishing to check the emergence profile, interdental contact points, static and dynamic occlusions, and ceramic color (2M2 using Vita 3D-Master , Vita) (Figure 20). When placing the direct-implant crowns, all previous points were checked, and crowns were then screwed with an insertion torque equal to 30 N cm (Figures 21 and 22).\\nThe patient was satisfied with this rehabilitation, both from a functional and aesthetic point of view.\\nControls were realized at 2 weeks and 1 month in order to check occlusion, insertion torque, plaque index, and patient comfort. All static occlusion contacts were deleted on implant fixed crowns, and canine guidance was carefully calibrated in lateral movements.\\nCalibrated interdental toothbrushes were prescribed in order to control plaque around implant-supported crown, especially in distal of crown in position 6.\\nA 1-year follow-up showed a total integration of crowns with profile emergence and volume apical to crowns fitting natural adjacent structures (Figure 23).\\nPatient was completely satisfied by the aesthetic and smile results (Figure 24).\\nIn the future, regular follow-up examinations will be carried out to ensure good tissue integration, proper plaque control, and peri-implant health.',\n",

The patient's personal history underlined that she had complained of inferior limb pain for approximately 1 year, but in the last month she associated painful edema of the right index finger, therefore she was referred to a pediatric surgeon, who suspected a proximal interphalangeal subjoint dislocation and requested a hand X-ray. The X-ray showed 2 opaque lesions in the right radial metaphysis, therefore she was admitted in our clinic for further investigations.\\nThe clinical exam performed at the moment of admission revealed the following pathological elements: weight and height deficit, W: 17.6 kg (-0.88 SD), H: 109.5 cm (-1.02 SD), BMI: 14.7 (-0.78 SD), deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger (Fig. 1), abnormal position of the inferior limbs (genu valgum), and bilateral flat feet.\\nThe laboratory test performed during admission, namely CBC count, transaminases, immunity status (IgA, IgM, and IgG) tests, peripheral smear, but also thyroid hormones, rheumatoid factor, antistreptolysin O titer, anticitrulinated protein antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, circulating immune complexes, parathormone, and serum phosphorus, were all within normal limits. The X-ray of inferior limbs revealed multiple metaphyseal osteochondromas of the distal femur, proximal tibia, and fibula of the 3rd right metatarsal bone, and proximal and medial phalanges of the 2nd, 3rd. and 4th right toes (Fig. 2, 3 and 4).\\nWe also performed a thorax and a spinal column X-ray, but no pathological aspects were identified.

Past medical history was unremarkable and without mention of recent illness. On presentation, the patient was well oriented in no severe distress, physical examination was notable for epigastric tenderness with guarding. Heart rate was 116 beats/minute, blood pressure 94/59 mm/Hg and a temperature of 37.4 C. The patient was admitted to the surgical department for evaluation. A chest and abdomen CT revealed marked liver enlargement with fatty change, and minimal amounts of pleural and pericardial fluid. No surgical etiology was recognized and due to laboratory findings of renal failure (Creatinine 3.88 mg/dl BUN 119.7 mg/dl), the patient was transferred to the medical department.\\nShortly after arrival, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly to a state of agitation and shock and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. On arrival blood pressure measured 79/45 mm/Hg, pulse 170 beats/minute with episodes of SVT. In addition, the patient developed dyspnea, with a respiratory rate of 48 breaths/minute and anuria. Core temperature measured 33.1 C. Examination revealed marked peripheral cyanosis, distended jugular veins with cool extremities. Air entry to both lungs was reduced and palpation of the abdomen was noted for tenderness and an enlarged liver. Laboratory analysis showed lactic acidosis (pH 7.22, lactate 129 mg/dl), renal failure (creatinine 2.11 mg/dl), and rhabdomyolysis (CPK 3,205 IU/l). Liver function tests and coagulation indices were also disturbed ( total bilirubin 2.74, direct bilirubin 1.03 mg/dl, AST 1169 IU/l, ALT 890 IU/l, LDH 1743 IU/l, INR 1.7, factor V level 18%,). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was within normal limits. Factor V levels continued to decline to a nadir of 5%. The above laboratory results, in combination with encephalopathy, indicated fulminant hepatic failure accompanied by multi-system organ failure.\\nThe patient failed a trial of positive pressure ventilation and was subsequently intubated and ventilated mechanically. A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted and fluid resuscitation started, steroids and vasopressors were given. Echocardiography was used to rule out pericardial tamponade; normal ventricular and valvular function was demonstrated. Continuous hemodiafiltration was started and switched to standard hemodialysis a week later. A tracheotomy was later performed due to the need for prolonged ventilation. Blood, urine, sputum and peritoneal fluid aspirate were cultured and gram and Ziell-Nielsen stained. Empiric antibiotic therapy was then started. Culture results were negative. Serologic testing for acute or chronic infection with viral hepatitis types A, B and C, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus returned negative. Further serologic testing for Ricketsia conorii, Coxiella burnetii were also negative. A thick film smear for blood-borne parasites and stool collection for ova and parasites were negative. Due to a high osmolar gap, levels of methanol, ethylene glycol and acetyl salicylic acid were checked and no traces were found.\\nA health bureau inspector was sent to the residence of the patient and found a stock of canned food the patient consumed almost exclusively for a period of months. Specimens were examined at the ministry of health. AFB1 was found at a level of 19.6 ppb (allowed level < 5 ppb). The patient's condition gradually improved on supportive treatment. Vasopressors were stopped and dialysis discontinued after blood pressure, renal function and CPK values returned to normal. Liver function tests improved markedly. After 21 days of mechanical ventilation the patient was weaned and the tracheotomy closed on the 36th day. The patient was returned to the medical department for observation and physiotherapy.

       "    'case_text': \"The proband first came to medical attention at one month of age when, after an uneventful gestation and delivery, he was noted to have abnormal movements characterized as myoclonic seizures. Over the ensuing months, seizures evolved to consist of both generalized tonic clonic and myoclonic events, with frequent status epilepticus, which was exacerbated by febrile events, resulting in several dozen hospitalizations. Seizures are now better controlled, but on a regimen of Oxcarbazepine, Topiramate, Levetiracetam and Zonisamide. At approximately two years of age, the patient developed truncal and head titubation and adventitious movements characterized as choreathetoid, which intruded on sleep and residual neurologic function. Upon initial observation and subsequently, the patient showed no evidence of dysmorphic facies, though he was microcephalic (orbitofrontal head circumference >2 standard deviations below the mean). The patient has also suffered from severe developmental stagnation and now, at age 10 years, is able to only minimally communicate with his care providers, is unable to sit or walk and does not have any self-help skills. Neuroimaging, first obtained at several months of age, and repeated serially over the course of his care, showed an initial severe deficit in the development of age appropriate myelination that has never normalized. Indeed, the most recent MRI, performed at 7 years of age, has shown evidence of progression of myelination but at levels that are still severely reduced (Figure 1A-C), consistent with severely delayed myelination.\\nElectroencephalogram telemetry done at age two years was characterized by high voltage background slowing (delta range, 0.5-2.5 Hz) and superimposed multifocal interictal sharp discharges with occasional periods of burst-suppression. Habitual clinical events were recorded as myoclonias involving the extremities with associated oral dyskinesias followed by a motionless appearance, without changes in the electrographic background, most consistent with subcortical events. Subsequent EEGs have continued to show an absence of normal background organization with multifocal epileptiform discharges during wakefulness and with activation in sleep, although without ictal events (Figure 1D).\\nThe patient's seizures were refractory to medical management until approximately 7 years of age when the patient was placed on multiple anticonvulsants, at which point they became infrequent. The underlying cause of the seizures and delayed myelination, however, remained enigmatic. Extensive biochemical and genetic testing revealed no abnormalities other than mildly increased levels of sialic acid in the CSF and urine, and subsequent fibroblast and genetic studies of sialic acid metabolism were unremarkable.\\nThe patient's presentation and severely delayed myelination were consistent with an inherited leukoencephalopathy, and he was therefore enrolled prospectively in a Myelin Disorders Bioregistry Project study on unclassified leukoencephalopathies at Children's National Medical Center (CNMC). To investigate the possible genetic origin of the patient's disease we performed whole exome sequencing on DNA collected from the proband and the unaffected parents. We produced > 19 Gb of sequence for each individual, yielding a mean depth of 57 fold coverage with an average 90.4% of target bases sequenced at least 18 times. Using a custom-developed pipeline that integrates parental variant calls into the analysis of the affected child, a heterozygous de novo mutation in KCNT1 (MIM 608167; NM_020822.2) was identified in the proband (NM_020822: c.2794T>A, p.F932I; Figure 1E). Sanger sequencing of the trio confirmed that this mutation was specific to the patient, and further analysis showed that it is not present in dbSNP135, the 1000 Genomes Project database or the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project database. This was the only de novo mutation identified in this screen that passed our filtering criteria. KCNT1 p.F932 is highly conserved (phyloP score of 0.989744), and the p.F932I change is, in principle, the most damaging non-synonymous change found in our screen, with a PolyPhen2 score of 0.998, a SIFT score of 0.99, and MutationTaster score of 0.78.\",\n",

The patient was commenced on intravenous flucloxacillin for a presumed native joint septic arthritis.\\nAn ultrasound of the right shoulder was performed which failed to identify any significant intra-articular effusion. An MRI scan of the shoulder girdle demonstrated a moderate joint effusion, extensive swelling and abnormal signal within the subscapularis and teres minor [Figures 1 and 2]. The initial suspicion was of septic arthritis.\\nA posterior portal arthroscopic washout the shoulder was subsequently performed. A moderate amount of turbid fluid was discovered and multiple samples were sent. The joint was irrigated until clear with 6 L of saline. The immediate Gram stain of the turbid fluid failed to identify any bacteria.\\nFurther surgical exploration was undertaken 3 days later because of poor clinical response. The lack of specific clinical signs made this clinical decision difficult. A posterior abscess could not be excluded. A deltopectoral approach was performed. No clear edema was encountered down to subscapularis. A subscapularis split failed to show pus in the joint. A finger sweeping under deltoid (laterally and posteriorly) opened an abscess which drained 500 mls of foul smelling, dark green pus. A large cavity of pus was identified between infraspinatus, teres minor and deltoid. Multiple samples were again taken. One was referred for 16s rRNA PCR.\\nA further debridement was undertaken 3 days later. The shoulder was approached posteriorly and pus was identified between the deltoid and infraspinatus muscle bellies. The anterior incision was also re-opened and further pus drained. The posterior and lateral deltoid was necrotic and was resected. Again multiple biopsies, including both muscle and fat were sent for analysis. The antibiotic regimen was modified to intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam, however, shortly afterwards the specimen from the third surgical washout grew mixed anaerobes. Antibiotics were changed accordingly to gentamicin and then further to metronidazole and ciprofloxacin when sensitivities were available. Shortly afterwards the 16s rRNA PCR identified a mixed trace with fusobacterium species and Prevotella species. This suggested a primary upper airway focus.\\nThe patient's inflammatory makers transiently improved and then deteriorated once again. A repeat MRI scan was performed to ensure no other source of infection. It demonstrated no significant deterioration in the joint since open surgery. There was a small amount of joint fluid but no significant effusion. However, there was gross deterioration and swelling in the appearances of the surrounding musculature with gas and fluid in the soft tissues. This was highly suggestive of a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection. A fourth open debridement of the right deltoid area was undertaken on day 16 for failure of the inflammatory markers to improve. Pus was again identified and mixed anaerobes grown. Thorough debridement was carried out on the first episode so the re-accumulation was surprising.\\nThe reason for recurrence was investigated. In order to exclude causes of an impaired immune response, a global immune screen, in addition to HIV and diabetes testing, was performed. It is of note that he was investigated with a CT on admission that showed no obvious collection making seeding from diverticulitis unlikely. It is postulated that, given his upper airway viral prodrome and the causative organism that this gentleman had a rare complication of Lemierre's syndrome.\\nHe was discharged on ciprofloxacin and reviewed at day 14 and day 21 after discharge. At both points he remained well and his inflammatory markers remained normal. At 6 months he remained systemically well and had full range of movement in his right shoulder.\",\n",

Left upper lung field nodule was diagnosed by endobronchial ultrasound with a guide sheath as squamous cell carcinoma with high programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (70%) (Fig. 2A). 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed uptake in both nodules. The cancer stage was determined as cT3N0M1a. After 13 cycles of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, chest CT revealed a dramatic decrease in the size of the lesion in the left upper lobe (Fig. 1C), but the size of the lesion in the right lower lobe was significantly increased (Fig. 1D). Because the treatment effect differed between the bilateral lung lesions, a definitive right lower lung nodule diagnosis was obtained with CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (CTNB) (Fig. 2B).\\nSamples were obtained from the right lower lesion by CTNB. Pathological findings revealed squamous cell carcinoma with nonexpression of PD-L1. Therefore, treatment of the right lower nodule was ineffective because of PD-L1 nonexpression. Following discussion with the cancer board, right lower lobectomy was recommended.\\nHowever, although surgery was recommended in this case, the patient's bronchial asthma was severe. She had with a history of refractory asthma for approximately 20 years. She was treated with ICS, long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and antiallergic drug therapy. She was occasionally treated with oral or systemic corticosteroids for exertional dyspnea.\\nThese treatments were all determined to be insufficient if the patient was to undergo lung surgery. On physical examination, her peripheral arterial blood oxygen saturation was 95% in room air, but chest auscultation revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing. The maximum blood eosinophil count was 680/muL. The forced expiratory volume in 1.0 second (FEV1) was 1280 mL (%FEV1, 76.3%), vital capacity (VC) was 2080 mL (%VC, 94.8%), and peak flow was 196 L/min in a pulmonary function test.\\nBenralizumab was administered before surgery. No adverse events occurred. Two days after benralizumab administration, her asthma symptoms (wheezing, cough, and dyspnea) disappeared. Pulmonary function tests and eosinophil count were performed again 4 days after benralizumab administration. Her peak flow was improved from 196 to 210 L/min, and her eosinophil count was reduced to 0/muL. Surgical resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed 5 days after benralizumab administration. The eosinophil count in surgical tissue was markedly reduced compared with that in preoperative CTNB tissue (Fig. 3A and B). No severe asthma attacks occurred after surgical resection and benralizumab administration, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. Respiratory function tests 6 weeks after surgery showed FEV1 of 1120 mL (%FEV1, 70.9%), VC of 1740 mL (%VC, 80.0%), and peak flow of 240 L/min. The patient was administered benralizumab continuously after surgery, and no asthma attacks or cancer recurrence occurred for 6 months after surgery.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"In July 2012, a 34-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a 4-month history of headaches, paroxysmal vertigo, nausea, and photophobia, with acute worsening of symptoms over the previous week. His past medical history was unremarkable, and there was no significant family history or any occupational exposure potentially associated with sarcoma.  Figure 1 provides a timeline of events including diagnostic assessments and interventions. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated a 2.4 x 2.5 cm mass in the right lateral to midtemporal lobe and associated area of hemorrhage (Figures 2(a) and 2(e)). Dexamethasone was prescribed for cerebral edema and levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis. A subtotal resection was achieved using a right temporal craniotomy and stealth-guided tumor resection. Pathologic review identified a WHO Grade II Astrocytoma (Figure 2(i)). The patient was treated with localized radiation therapy (RT) with 5040 cGy which was well-tolerated. No chemotherapy regimen was started at this time.\\nRepeated MRI at 4 and 5 months after completion of RT showed a growing nodule of contrast enhancement in the right frontal lobe and associated vasogenic edema despite dexamethasone treatment (Figure 2(b)). MRI perfusion studies showed increased blood flow to these new areas (Figure 2(f)), and a second tumor resection was performed. Pathologic assessment revealed a mixture of radiation necrosis and WHO Grade III Astrocytoma (Figure 2(j)) with no isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation. The patient began a regimen of temozolomide (cycle 1 : 150 mg/m2, days 1-5 each 28-day cycle; cycle 2 : 175 mg/m2). After two cycles of temozolomide treatment, the patient presented to the Emergency Department with a 1-week history of acute headache, nausea, and vomiting. MRI revealed a 4.4 x 3.5 x 4 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion with perfusion, consistent with progressing tumor. Imaging also showed a significant increase in surrounding vasogenic edema which proved difficult to manage due to increasing complications from dexamethasone treatment, including persistent folliculitis and myopathy.\\nThe patient's treatment regimen was changed to bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) to treat the underlying tumor and vasogenic edema, in an effort to reduce corticosteroid exposure. The patient tolerated 6 cycles of bevacizumab well, and his clinical condition began to improve. However, a follow-up MRI showed increased enhancement of the right frontal lobe mass and new dural-based nodular areas of enhancement (Figure 2(c)). Clinically, the patient appeared to be responding to bevacizumab. As expected, there was reduced cerebral blood flow observed on MRI perfusion; however, the increased enhancement was concerning as this is typically reduced with bevacizumab treatment (Figure 2(g)). An initial concern was there may be dissemination of high-grade glioma. A lumbar puncture was deferred due to mass effect. A biopsy of a right frontal dural-based nodule was pursued, and the pathologic assessment was consistent with a high-grade sarcoma lacking any further differentiating features (Figures 2(k) and 3(a)-3(c)). While the type of sarcoma could not be determined, it was specifically not gliosarcoma. After presentation of the sarcoma, the patient was referred to a genetic counselor with concern for a genetic predisposition (specifically, Li-Fraumeni syndrome). However, genetic testing revealed no pathogenic mutations in the TP53 gene or any other known mutations.\\nFurther imaging of the neuroaxis was completed to ensure there was no spread of the sarcoma through the subarachnoid space. MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed no areas of abnormal enhancement, and a CT PET of the body revealed no other new hypermetabolic lesions. Multidisciplinary discussions with medical and radiation oncologists ensued regarding the number and spread of the dural-based lesions, and chemotherapy was considered to be the best treatment option for the sarcoma. The patient was started on a regimen consisting of ifosfamide (3750 mg/m2 days 1-2 each 21-day cycle) and doxorubicin (30 mg/m2 days 1-2 each 21-day cycle), continuation of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks; 4 additional cycles), and initiation of NovoTTF (Optune) treatment for the malignant glioma. The chemotherapy treatment was not well-tolerated, and the treatment course was complicated by neutropenic fever and fatigue despite growth factor support and dose reduction. Thus, the patient only completed 3 cycles. Data from the Optune device showed sporadic use, averaging less than 18 hours per day.\\nUltimately, the patient's condition began to further deteriorate. Follow-up MRI revealed an increase in dural-based nodules involving the entire right hemisphere and left cerebellum, as well as an increase in size of the centrally necrotic mass in the right frontal lobe (Figures 2(d) and 2(h)). The recommendation was made to initiate hospice care. The patient received a second opinion at another institution, where he received a gemcitabine/docetaxel regimen, but only completed one dose of gemcitabine due to thrombocytopenia and clinical worsening. The patient received one additional dose of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg). He continued to decline and eventually succumbed to glioma and sarcoma less than 2 years after his initial diagnosis.\",\n",

Serological examination revealed that he was negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies. On computed tomography examination, irregular and slightly low-density (~26 HU) shadows were observed in the right lobe of the liver, near the top of the diaphragm, representing a tumor measuring 29 x 23 mm with clear boundaries (Figure 1). Serological tests revealed that the patient had a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 5.38 microg/L (normal range, 0-5.0 microg/L), alpha fetoprotein level of 3.36 microg/L (normal range, 0-20 microg/L), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level of 36.97 micro/ml (normal range, 0-37 micro/ml), and cancer antigen-125 level of 11.42 micro/ml (normal range, 0-35 micro/ml).\\nDuring the operation, the tumor was found to be located in the eighth segment of the right lobe of the liver; thus, the right hepatic lobe was partially resected. The tumor was a grayish-yellow mass (2.5 x 2 x 2 cm) located under the liver capsule with a clear boundary from surrounding tissues. Microscopic observation revealed that it was moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with a cord-like, trabecular structure and a pattern of local pseudoglandular growth. Some tumor cells were translucent, and multiple satellite nodules were found around the main tumor nodule (Figures 2A,B). An area of liver tissue (~0.3 cm) located 0.5 cm from the main tumor had a benign-appearing follicular thyroid structure (Figures 2B,C). The lesion was too small to appear on CT images. The follicles contained colloid tissue and were lined with low cuboidal cells with scant cytoplasm; lymphatic tissue was also present in the area.\\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the hepatocellular carcinoma revealed hepatocyte antigen positivity, cytokeratin-19 negativity (Figure 2D), and glypican-3 (GPC-3) positivity (Figure 2E). Epithelial cells in the area with a follicular thyroid structure showed no atypia; they were negative for hepatocyte paraffin 1 (Hep Par-1) and positive for thyroglobulin (TG) (Figure 2F), PAX8 (Figure 2G), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1; Figure 2H).\\nThe patient had no history of a thyroid tumor, and thyroid function test results were normal. Thyroid hormone levels were in normal ranges (triiodothyronine, 1.27 ng/mL; thyroxine, 10.5 g/dl; free triiodothyronine, 3.84 pmol/L; and free thyroxine, 17.76 pmol/L).\\nUltrasound examination showed no primary thyroid tumor. The final diagnosis was moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with heterotopic thyroid tissue in the liver. One month after surgery, all of the patient's serological markers were normal; no tumor recurrence or metastasis has been detected for 7 postoperative months.\",\n",

The condition evolved with progressive growth of a painful, adhered and fibroelastic consistency mass in the central region of the forehead of the skull, eight days before admission. Report of fever stopped two days after admission, with no signs of meningism, rhinorrhea or any focal neurological deficit. No traumatic event, past or recurrence of sinusopathy or other comorbidity that was related. Patient also referred no use of antibiotics. Laboratory tests also did not present alterations of hematimetric indices or inflammatory tests.\\nBlood culture was not performed. CT scan of the skull was performed, which showed an expansive hypodense lesion in the frontal region with intracranial extension associated with perilesional edema (Figure 1), and then transferred to the neurosurgery department with suspicion that the identified expansive formation would have neoplastic origin.\\nThe patient underwent brain MRI, which revealed an expansive lesion in the frontal subcutaneous tissue, extending through a bone defect in the frontal sinus that communicated with an extra-axial nodular formation with intra-axial component and circumcision edema with important compressive effect, suggesting a complicated PET with concomitant cerebral abscess (Figure 2). Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g administrated 12 h/12 h) and metronidazole (7,5 mg/kg administrated each 8 h) was initiated, for eight days before the surgery. Intranasal corticosteroid therapy was not prescribed for our patient.\\nThe patient was submitted to neurosurgical approach by bicoronal incision and, as cutaneous flap was rebalanced, granulation tissue, bone erosion with dural adhesion and spontaneous extravasation of purulent secretion was identified. Drainage of the abscess by puncture initially. Performed 5 x 5 cm frontal craniotomy resecting the entire osteomyelitis area. Resected the residual abscess and capsule, a fistulous hole (Figure 3B) was verified communicating purulent contents of the frontal sinus with brain abscess. After cranialization of the frontal sinus, evacuation of the subdural empyema and subgaleal abscess, exhaustive cavity washing was performed with 1,500 mL of saline plus gentamicin. Cranial reconstruction performed with autologous bone part, after curettage and drill of the internal eroded plate of the frontal bone flap and resected material (pus, granulation tissue and frontal sinus mucosa) sent for microbiological analysis and culture, but it was not identified any organism's growth. This sterile culture result was probably due to empirical use of preoperative antibiotics, but anaerobic causative agents, destroyed after contact with oxygen, are also a possibility. Similarly, access to histological examination of the frontal sinus mucosa and the granulation tissue collected was not obtained. This type of intervention - surgical approach, associated with antibiotic therapy, was determined based on characteristics such as continuous abscess growth, intracranial mass effect, risk of complications, and neurological deficits.\\nThe patient followed a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotic therapy, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole (7 weeks). A new MRI was performed, 28 days after surgery, and showed the surgical a marked reduction of the frontal extra-axial collection. Meningeal thickening and residual frontal abscess surround by perilesional edema were observed, as shown in the pre and postoperative comparative images in Figure 4.\\nDue to the significant improvement of our patient condition, she was discharged after 43 days of post-surgical follow-up, with complementary oral antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin. It was chosen due to their broad spectrum, low cost, affordability and recommendation by the Hospital Infection Control Committee. The patient was subsequent outpatient follow-up at the service during the first 9 months, in three consultations, with satisfactory clinical, functional, and radiological control.

Laboratory evaluation on day 1 of illness was notable for 8% bands without leukocytosis on complete blood count (CBC). Chest x-ray, urinalysis, blood, and urine cultures were not revealing. Low grade temperatures continued, and on day 4 he had temperature to 38.8 C, associated with leukocytosis 16.4 k/mm, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 11.7 mg/dl, and procalcitonin 0.51 ng/ml. He was hyponatremic 133 mEq/L, hypoalbuminemic 2.7 g/dl, and had elevated transaminases (AST 171 U/L, ALT 164 U/L). Infectious evaluation with blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cultures and respiratory pathogen panel by PCR were unrevealing. Empiric treatment was initiated with cefepime and ampicillin. On day 8 of illness, leukocyte count (15.6 k/microl) and CRP (21.5 mg/dl) had further increased and bandemia (15%) was noted. Computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained and demonstrated multifocal pulmonary and splenic nodules measuring up to 13 and 8 mm, respectively ( Figures 1A, B ). Biopsy of the right lung lesion was obtained, and antimicrobials were broadened to meropenem, voriconazole, and micafungin. Fungal etiology was suspected, therefore double anti-fungal coverage was used. Over the next day, bilateral lower extremity mottling and right lower extremity edema with delayed capillary refill were noted. Within hours, the patient progressed to cardiac and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion. Hydrocortisone was added as well for vasopressor refractory shock. Repeat laboratory evaluation demonstrated cytopenias, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy compared to less than 24 h prior ( Table 2 ).\\nOver the next 24 h, the patient deteriorated rapidly despite broadening anti-microbials to include vancomycin and amphotericin in addition to meropenem and aggressive resuscitation with multiple blood products. A presumptive diagnosis of HLH was considered based on presence of four of eight known criteria ( Table 1 ) and high dose dexamethasone was added to treat his inflammatory response. Despite these efforts, the patient succumbed to multiorgan failure. Blood and tissue biopsy cultures returned post-mortem, yielding Burkholderia cepacia. Autopsy confirmed hemophagocytosis within the spleen, liver, and bone marrow ( Figure 2 ). Post-mortem next generation sequencing ruled out mutations in genes associated with familial HLH.\\nA half Seminole Indian, half African American male was diagnosed with X-linked CGD (DHR SI 1, CYBB, c.492delA), after presenting with Burkholderia gladioli cervical lymphadenitis at 16 months of age. At 23 months of age, he presented with fevers, diarrhea, and mild cough. Workup revealed a small perianal fistula and mild splenomegaly with tiny subcentimeter T2 hypointense lesions, consistent with granulomas. A biopsy was deemed not possible due to size and location of lesions. Bronchoscopy was normal while endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy showed moderate inflammation of the colon, consistent with CGD-associated colitis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood cultures remained without growth at that time. Patient was empirically treated with meropenem, concurrently treated for Clostridium difficile infection with oral vancomycin, and corticosteroids 1 mg/kg were initiated for treatment of colitis. Fevers improved and he was discharged home to complete 10 days of antibiotic treatment.\\nTwo days after discharge, he returned with fevers and abdominal distension. He was empirically treated with meropenem and voriconazole. Imaging of the chest and abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly with small ascites ( Figure 1C ). He was found to be anemic (hemoglobin 6.9 g/dl) and given blood transfusion. Because of fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia, a diagnosis of HLH was considered. Hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia were found so methylprednisolone 2mg/kg and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 gm/kg were initiated. Over the next several days, he developed pancytopenia and liver failure with coagulopathy, liver synthetic dysfunction, and elevated liver enzymes ( Table 2 ). Laboratory evaluation remained consistent with HLH with high ferritin, CXCL9, and elevated soluble IL-2R (CD25) and no source of infection identified on extensive evaluation. Anakinra was added as adjunct therapy. Three weeks after initial presentation, (1,3)-beta-D-glucan assay returned elevated (234 pg/ml) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture from first admission began growing Penicillium sp. Amphotericin B was added for additional fungal coverage. On hospital day 10, he developed acute respiratory distress necessitating intubation; imaging was consistent with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. Despite aggressive ventilator management, he ultimately progressed to cardiac arrest and resuscitation efforts were not successful. The parents declined autopsy; no further analysis of genes associated with familial HLH was performed.\\nAn 8-week-old Mexican American boy presented with 2 days of fever (39 C) and 1 week of erythematous rash. The patient was admitted for a sepsis-rule out, empirically placed on ampicillin and cefotaxime following CSF, blood, and urine culture collection. All cultures were negative. His past history was remarkable for contracting pertussis at 10 days of life for which he was treated without complications.\\nDespite antimicrobial therapy, while still hospitalized, his fevers (38.5-40 C) continued and he developed leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. His clinical course further deteriorated with the development of seizures; ceftriaxone and vancomycin were added for empiric meningitis coverage. Hepatosplenomegaly was noted on physical exam and a diagnosis of HLH was considered. Laboratory evaluation showed hyperferrtinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and elevated soluble IL2R level, all consistent with HLH ( Tables 1  and  2 ). Perforin expression was normal and NK cell function was inconclusive due to an inadequate sample. A bone marrow biopsy revealed increased histiocyte number with evident hemophagocytosis. HLH treatment was initiated with dexamethasone, cyclosporine, and IVIG. The patient received 8 weeks of therapy and ultimately recovered. However, at week 7 of treatment for HLH, he developed shock and respiratory failure in the setting of abdominal distention with ascites. Blood and peritoneal cultures yielded Candida lusitaniae; he was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Additionally, he received eight infusions of granulocytes. Seizures persisted and a brain MRI revealed diffuse infra- and supratentorial leptomeningeal enhancement. Examination of CSF showed pleocytosis, but cultures were negative. He was diagnosed with presumptive fungal meningoencephalitis. Seizures were managed with levetiracetam. An enlarged cervical lymph node was also biopsied which revealed multiple granulomas, many of which had central caseating necrosis and degenerating fungal pseudohyphae.\\nGiven the lymph node histopathology, a DHR assay was performed and noted to be markedly abnormal (SI 1). Next generation sequencing of genes associated with familial HLH was negative; however, assessment for CGD relevant genes revealed a hemizygous mutation in CYBB (c.1557delA) and confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked CGD. Profound developmental delays related to his severe illness and fungal meningoencephalitis remained. However, with steady developmental progress he ultimately underwent a matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) following conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab. Now at 7 years of age, he is well and requires no immunosuppression. Seizures are controlled on levetiracetam.',\n",

Imaging revealed a large consolidation in the right upper lobe and enlarged lymph nodes ( Figure 1D ). Over the next 2 days, his respiratory distress worsened, and he developed hepatosplenomegaly. He was transitioned to doxycycline and ampicillin-sulbactam for treatment of pneumonia. Given lack of clinical improvement despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, a lung biopsy was performed which revealed necrotizing granulomas. Inflammatory markers continued to rise and a diagnosis of HLH was made with the patient meeting the following criteria: persistent fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated ferritin, and elevated soluble IL-2R levels ( Table 1 ); however bone marrow evaluation was normal with no evidence of hemophagocytosis. Because of the patient's clinical findings and recently revealed family history of X-linked CGD in two nephews, a diagnosis of CGD was suspected and amphotericin was added for fungal coverage. CGD was confirmed with abnormal DHR and next generation sequencing of a panel of genes associated with immunodeficiency identifying pathogenic hemizygous variant c.3G>A in CYBB, with no reported variants in primary HLH genes. He was then transitioned to piperacillin-sulbactam and amphotericin, with minocycline for MRSA coverage, followed by initiation of dexamethasone and IVIG, that was met initially with defervescence.\\nNineteen days after presentation, he had recurrence of fever and despite treatment with anti-microbials, IVIG, and corticosteroids, he developed profound hypoxemia associated with pulmonary infiltrates and an embolism. Micafungin was added but respiratory failure persisted eventually requiring extracorporeal life support (ECMO) for persistent hypoxemia. On the day of ECMO initiation, his blood culture grew Burkholderia multivoran and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was added for additional therapy. Over the next 10 days, inflammatory markers continued to rise, and blood cultures remained persistently positive. Piperacillin-sulbactam was changed to meropenem, levofloxacin was added, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole continued. Because of persistently rising inflammatory markers and marginal clinical improvement, basiliximab, a monoclonal antibody that antagonizes the IL-2 receptor, was administered with drop in ferritin levels from >100,000 to 70,745 ng/ml after administration. A second dose of basiliximab was administered one day later, and ferritin dropped further to 34,075 ng/ml. However, the patient clinically decompensated on this day and developed pulmonary hemorrhage. Basiliximab was administered a third time 6 days later but ferritin levels subsequently rose to 65,027 ng/ml ( Table 2 ). Because of the patient's critical status and uncontrolled inflammation, emapalumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and granulocyte transfusions were administered as life saving measures. Clinical parameters did not improve, and ferritin remained >100,000 ng/ml after emapalumab. Despite these interventions, the patient developed progressive hypotension and died after failed resuscitation from cardiac arrest, 33 days after initial presentation.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 68-year-old male with past medical history significant of RA (on Methotrexate and Sulfasalazine), polycythaemia, high BMI with performance status of 1, presented with one week history of fever and cough, lymphopenia and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) accompanied by bilateral peripherally-dominant opacities on chest X-ray (Figure 1).\\nHe subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to ICU two days later with type 1 respiratory failure. Initially he was treated with Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) but due to further deterioration, he required intubation and ventilation for adequate respiratory support and mild inotropic support. Hence, the intubation was carried out as planned by an expert physician without any immediate complications and he was ventilated on SIMV mode with PEEP of 12, FiO2of 60% on which he was able to maintain his PaO2 of at least 8. Otherwise his cardiovascular and renal function were stable requiring only minimal vasopressor support. There was also acceptable inflammatory response to pre-emptive broad-spectrum antibiotics cover.\\nSubsequently, and nearly 2 days later it became apparent that he developed a substantial surgical emphysema over the face, front of upper chest and back, shoulder and upper arms which was progressive. Additionally, oxygen and ventilator requirements were increased needing FiO2 of 100% and PEEP 16 to maintain previously described respiratory parameters. Clinical examination and urgent chest X-ray did not support any deterioration from the COVID-19 previously noted infiltrates neither provided a plausible cause for the surgical emphysema (Figure 2A). Therefore, an urgent CT thorax was carried out which demonstrated significant pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with air under diaphragm. There was no suspicion to suggest gastrointestinal tract perforation. Additionally, no pneumothorax was diagnosed and the previously noted COVID-19 infiltrates were stable (Figure 2B).\\nIn view of increased respiratory requirements and lack of imaging evidence of any cause for the surgical emphysema and the clinical deterioration, a flexible bronchoscopy was performed, at high suspicion, which exhibited glassy like residue/laceration at 5 o'clock position approximately at 6th tracheal ring measuring 2 cm x 2 cm, possibly from previous clot or laceration. No other signs of penetration through the airways were noted (Figure 3).\\nThe most probable cause of his deterioration initially was thought to be secondary to trauma because of his previous intubation but based on its delayed presentation, the fact that the intubation was uneventful and that it was performed by a specialist, a ulcerative lesion related to the active disease process (COVID-19 and/or RA) could not be overlooked, although biopsies were not performed because of the deteriorated condition of the patient and hence no direct evidence of this could be provided. It seems more probable however, that a trauma to the trachea was caused during intubation which was sealed by the endotracheal tube balloon which got moved later on, despite the fact that the patient was not turned to prone position as he has been unwell for this.\\nNext, the endotracheal tube position was adjusted (i.e., positioned more peripherally inside the trachea closer to the carina past the laceration under direct vision) and bilateral pectoral fasciotomies were performed with application of two negative suction dressings pumps (Vacuum Assisted Closure - VAC), which helped improve the extent of surgical emphysema. His O2 requirements and ventilation improved importantly and a conservative treatment for his tracheal laceration was decided based on the situation and his clinical condition.\\nThe requisite thus far had been a single organ support. However, a few days later, patient's clinical condition deteriorated again by developing atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute kidney and liver injury with hemodynamic compromise. He required increased vasopressor support with moderate doses of noradrenaline, pharmacological cardioversion of AF and hemofiltration was also performed. Despite multi-organ support and accepted management of COVID-19 pneumonitis at the time, his respiratory function deteriorated with increasing oxygen requirements, an increased alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient and worsening of radiological findings of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 pneumonitis.\\nUnfortunately, the patient did not recover from multi-organ failure and subsequent to multidisciplinary discussion and family involvement, the difficult decision was made to withdraw organ support on the tenth day of critical care admission in the context of worsening multi-organ failure (lung, cardiovascular and renal) caused by COVID-19 infection in a immunosuppressed state.\\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013).

She received 45 Gy at 50% isodose at the proximal cisternal extent of the left trigeminal nerve [Figure 1]. After GKS, she showed no symptoms for 18 years.\\nShe experienced a sudden onset of consciousness disturbance and right hemiparesis (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 20 points). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at the primary hospital. Diffusion-weighted images revealed a hyperintensity in the left insular cortex and a slight hyperintensity in the left MCA territory [Figure 2a]. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed occlusion of the horizontal segment of the left MCA [Figure 2b]. She received an intravenous injection of t-PA (Alteplase: 0.6 mg/kg) and was transferred to our hospital. At the time of arrival, no intracranial hemorrhage was noted on brain computed tomography (CT). We subsequently performed digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for only the left internal carotid artery and confirmed the presence of MCA occlusion, even after t-PA injection [Figure 2c]. Mechanical thrombectomy was then performed using the Solitaire FR/2 revascularization device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA; onset to reperfusion time: 3 h 13 min), and complete recanalization was achieved [Figure 2d]. Brain CT performed immediately after mechanical thrombectomy revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with a hematoma in the left cerebellar hemisphere [Figure 3a and b]. As CT angiography (CTA) could not confirm the presence of an aneurysm [Figure 3c and d], DSA of the posterior cerebral circulation was performed, and it revealed a small irregular-shaped aneurysm at the branching site of the left circumflex branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery [Figure 4a]. Since the aneurysm was located at the radiation field of the previous GKS, it was considered as a GKS-induced aneurysm, and it represented the bleeding source. Thus, we treated it using coil embolization [Figure 4b and c] and performed surgical hematoma removal and decompressive craniectomy.

       "    'case_text': 'An adult spayed female domestic shorthair cat was found crouching down in a yard of a private house. The cat was rescued as it was non-ambulatory in the pelvic limbs and had seemingly been abandoned. The cat was taken to the local veterinary clinic. Therefore, its age and history were unknown except that it had an operation scar on its abdomen. Its body weight was 3.1 kg. Screening tests for feline immunodeficiency virus antibody and feline leukaemia virus antigen were negative. Flea parasites were seen and the haircoat was matted throughout the body. Pain was not obvious when palpating the body. Episodes of head and neck scratching were elicited by palpating the upper cervical region (see Video 1 in the supplementary material), and resembled phantom scratching commonly seen in canine syringomyelia. It was sometimes accompanied by urination. The skin of this region was unremarkable.\\nAt the time of the rescue, complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry indicated dehydration and inflammation or infection. Under sedation, the haircoat was cut short. The general condition of the cat improved with nutrition support and a flea treatment using a topical formulation of selamectin (Revolution 6%; Zoetis JP). Prior to advanced diagnostic imaging that was conducted 1 month later, CBC and serum chemistry were performed again and the results were unremarkable.\\nNeurological examination was performed before advanced diagnostic imaging. Mentation was normal. The cat had non-ambulatory paraparesis in the pelvic limbs without urinary or faecal incontinence (see Video 2 in the supplementary material). Postural reaction of all four limbs was decreased. Spinal reflexes were normal in the thoracic limbs and hyper-reflexia was seen in the pelvic limbs. Nociception was normal in all four limbs. The perineal reflex was intact. Cranial nerve examinations were unremarkable. Neuroanatomical localisation revealed multifocal lesions, including in the C1-C5, C6-T2 and T3-L3 segments of the spinal cord, and/or brain.\\nSkeletal survey radiography revealed vertebral exostoses and extensive osteophytes from the upper cervical vertebra to the lower thoracic vertebra (C2-T10) (Figure 1). Changes were more severe at the ventral aspect of the spine, although changes were also found at the dorsal aspect. Morphological asymmetry of the pelvis was also found. No scoliosis or kyphosis was found, but dorsal extension of the neck was observed. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was performed and findings were unremarkable except for the absence of ovaries.\\nFurthermore, CT and MRI were performed under general anaesthesia to investigate the causes of the pelvic limb paresis and episodes of head and neck scratching.\\nCT of the axial skeleton was conducted using a 16-slice scanner (Supria; Hitachi Medical Systems). CT confirmed vertebral exostoses and extensive osteophytes between C2 and T10 and at the L7-S1 junction with higher CT values (Figure 2a-c), as well as radiographs. A pelvic fracture was also identified (Figure 2d), although this was not considered to be the cause of the pelvic limb paraparesis. CT-based three-dimensional volume rendering (Figure 3) and virtual endoscopy (see Video 3 in the supplementary material) were generated using an imaging workstation (AZE Virtual Place; AZE). CT-based virtual endoscopy revealed stenosis of the vertebral canal of the cervical and the rostral thoracic spine caused by hyperostosis along the spinal canal and protruded calcified intervertebral discs that may have been involved in hyperostosis (see Video 3 in the supplementary material). No ovaries were seen with CT in addition to ultrasonography.\\nMRI of the brain and spinal cord was performed with a 0.3-Tesla MRI scanner (AIRIS Vento; Hitachi Medical Systems). Sagittal T2-weighted (T2W) and transverse T2W imaging were obtained for brain MRI. Spinal MRI included the spinal cord between C2 and T11 for the sagittal T2W imaging, and between T2 and T7 for the transverse T2W, T1-weighted (T1W) and subsequent contrast-enhanced T1W imaging. Intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent, gadoteridol (0.15 mmol/kg [ProHance; Bracco Diagnostic]), was used for the contrast enhancement.\\nBrain MRI showed normal findings. Spinal MRI of the cervicothoracic region revealed a mild dilation of the central canal of the spinal cord with T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity without contrast enhancement at the T4-T5 region (Figure 4). In addition, multiple intervertebral disc protrusions and decreased T2 signal intensities of intervertebral discs were observed in the cervical and thoracic spine.\\nBased on the radiographic findings, differential diagnoses included hypervitaminosis A, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), osteochondromatosis (also known as multiple cartilaginous exostoses) and infectious spondylitis. However, MPS, DISH, osteochondromatosis and infectious spondylitis were thought to be unlikely for the reasons described in the discussion. Therefore, hypervitaminosis A was considered the most likely diagnosis.\\nAfter CT and MRI examination, serum concentrations of vitamin A from the affected cat, as well as two healthy cats used as controls, were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography by a commercial laboratory (Sanritsu Zelkova). The serum vitamin A concentrations of the affected cat and two healthy cats were 1.04, 0.46 and 0.66 micromol/l, respectively, all of which were unremarkable. The reference interval (RI) for serum vitamin A in cats was not available from the laboratory. The serum vitamin A RI in cats is reported to be 1.75-6.77 micromol/l, and plasma vitamin A levels of cats receiving liver diets ranged from 15.74 to 44.71 micromol/l in a study by Seawright et al.\\nThe progression of clinical signs such as neurological deficits and pain was not seen in 7 months of follow-up after the rescue, at the time of manuscript submission. Because non-ambulatory paraparesis in the pelvic limbs remained, a wheelchair for cats was put on, which assisted the cat with walking (see Video 2 in the supplementary material).\\nFor the treatment of episodes of head and neck scratching that were elicited by palpating the upper cervical region, pregabalin (2.5 mg/kg PO q24h for 1 week and q12h for 1 week [Lyrica; Pfizer]) was used; however, the therapeutic effect was not obvious. Then, oclacitinib (1.3 mg/kg PO q12h [Apoquel; Zoetis JP]) was initiated and clinical improvement was achieved (see Video 1 in the supplementary material). After discontinuing the drug, the sign recurred; thus, it was used as a maintenance treatment for the episodes.',\n",

Nakashima et al. first reported three cases of de novo CUL3 variants resulting in global DD, with or without epilepsy. Two of the patients had infantile spasms, while the other had short stature with mild to severe intellectual disability. Whole-exome sequencing identified one missense variant (c.854 T > C, p.(Val285Ala)) and two frameshift variants (c.137delG, p.(Arg46Leufs*32) and c.1239del, p.(Asp413Glufs*42)). In another case report, Iwafuchi et al. detected a stop-gain mutation in the CUL3 gene from a Japanese patient with ASD. This patient was presented with febrile status epilepticus that led to developmental regression, including the loss of verbal ability, eye contact, and ability to do activities of daily living. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo double base insertion into the CUL3 gene (c.1758_1759insTG, p. (Thr587*)). Furthermore, Kato et al. reported a novel CUL3 gene mutation (c.158G > a, p.Ser53Asn) that resulted in dysmorphic features, such as macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, and stony skin, in a child with global DD. Most recently, Vincent et al. reported the first case of NDD caused by CUL3 splice site variants. The patient presented with congenital hip dysplasia and global DD. Whole-exome sequencing identified splice site variants in CUL3 (c.379-2A > G). These case reports reveal a pattern of global DD and ID associated with CUL3 de novo mutations.',\n",

Severe de novo nonsense mutations of CUL3 in ASD were found in 2012 when O'Roak et al. performed exome sequencing on 677 ASD individuals from 209 families. Codina-Sola et al. reported CUL3 de novo mutations in a cohort of male idiopathic ASD patients (n = 36). Larger cohorts were carried out thereafter. De Rubeis et al. analyzed rare coding variants in 3,871 ASD cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls, which identified CUL3 as one of 107 high-risk ASD genes that cause de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations in more than 5% of ASD. Sanders et al. reported CUL3 de novo CNVs in patients with ASD (10,220 patients from 2,591 families) in the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) data. The largest array of SPARK analysis findings to date (including 42,607 autism cases) identified CUL3 as a genetic high-confidence LoF variant. The latest release of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the Autism Speaks MSSNG resource1 identified CUL3 as one of the 134 ASD-associated genes, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.1, in 5,100 ASD and 6,212 non-ASD parents and siblings. In the Chinese ASD cohort, Wang et al. conducted a study of recurrent de novo and likely gene-disruptive (LGD) mutations (n = 1,543), which identified CUL3 de novo LGD recurrences.\\nMissense mutations in CUL3 have also been identified in cohorts of ASD combine with ID, DD, or NDDs. Hormozdiari et al. analyzed exome sequencing data from 1,116 individuals with ASD and ID, which identified patients with severe Cul3 missense mutations have more significant intellectual impairment. Wang et al. performed an integrated gene analysis of de novo variants in 15,560 ASD and 31,052 DD, identifying CUL3 as one of the de novo variance-rich genes in 138 NDDs combinations. In a targeted sequencing study of 208 candidate genes in 11,730 patients and 2,867 controls, CUL3 was found to reach de novo significance and identified as one of the 91 NDDs risk genes with ASD and DD biases. da Silva Montenegro et al. performed a meta-analysis with more than 20,000 patients from NDDs cohorts and found mutations in CUL3.\\nOverall, the above evidence supports the notion that CUL3 is a high-risk gene for NDDs, especially ASD.\",\n",

These symptoms resolved on the administration of diphenhydramine 25 mg intravenously at the Emergency Department. The patient was referred, initially, to the Department of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology based on the suspicion of a reaction to RHEZ. A diagnosis of anaphylaxis-like and possibly idiosyncratic reaction to rifampicin was made.\\nOn further questioning by the primary team, the patient reported that while he was aware of his surroundings and was able to hear conversations around him, he felt \"physical blocked\" in that he was unable to respond with purposeful voluntary movements or speech; he additionally described abdominal discomfort and generalized weakness.\\nThe patient had just been prescribed daily rifampicin 600 mg, isoniazid 300 mg, ethambutol 1.6 g, pyrazinamide 1.75 g (i.e., standard RHEZ combination therapy for TB of uncertain origin and resistance, according to his weight of 98.3 kg) and pyridoxine 10 mg after increased nodular opacities in the left upper zone were observed on sequential chest X-rays (Figures 1 and 2), suggestive of granulomata.

After receiving multi-line treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, among others, the effect was not good and the patient's disease progressed. According to the results of clinical trials on biliary tumors, PD-1 antibody combined with lenvatinib was tried. There was no obvious abnormality in urine routine during baseline examination; meanwhile, the patient's psoriasis was also in an inactive period, which has been stable for a long time and did not require drug control. However, after combination treatment with lenvatinib and nivolumab, psoriasis recurred, with scattered rashes all over the body, and skin toxicity symptoms aggravated with the increase of the cumulative dose of the PD-1 antibody. The patient developed urinary tract irritation after three cycles. Urine examination revealed 375/mul white blood cells (WBCs) in the urine ( Figure 1 ). Although no bacteria were found in the urine culture, the possibility of bacterial cystitis was still considered after consultation with the urology department based on the patient's symptoms at that time. After antibiotic treatment, laboratory tests had indeed improved, but the patient's symptoms did not get better. Therefore, the treatment was discontinued. However, the patient's tumor indicators increased due to the discontinuation of lenvatinib and PD-1 antibody ( Figure 1 ). Imaging examinations also revealed new lesions located on the right posterior lobe of the liver and above the duodenum on the right side of the pancreatic head in the abdominal cavity ( Figure 2 ). In general surgery consultation, this patient was considered to have a chance of surgery, so an operation was performed. One month after the second operation, the patient's tumor indicators decreased and then increased again ( Figure 1 ). Except for a slight thickening of the local omentum, no lesions were found on imaging. At the same time, the patient's urinary tract symptoms improved after the drug has been withdrawn for more than 3 months. Therefore, Gemox chemotherapy (gemcitabine+oxaliplatin) was considered after the operation. Meanwhile, the patient's immunohistochemistry was positive for PD-L1. Taking the improvement of curative effect into account, and with the patient's insistence on trying, the treatment plan was finally determined as Gemox combined with the PD-L1 antibody. The patient then did not develop skin toxicity. After three cycles, the tumor markers dropped significantly, but bladder irritation reoccurred, which was significantly worse than before. Urine examination revealed that WBCs were 2,818/mul ( Figure 1 ) and bacteria were 512/mul. After consultation with the Department of Urology and Nephrology, bilateral ureteral stent implantation and cystoscopy and biopsy were decided. The result of the bladder biopsy indicated chronic inflammation of mucosal tissue, mucosal erosion in some areas, and proliferation of granulation tissues and fibroblasts ( Figure 3 ). After the multidisciplinary consultation, immune-related cystitis was considered; treatment with steroid hormones was given, which started at 2 mg/kg, then slowly decreased. The urinary tract irritation symptoms were relieved, and the laboratory examination was also significantly improved. After 4 weeks, the urine routine was reviewed, and the WBC count was 66/mul. At present, during the hormone reduction period, urine routine and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) are continued to be monitored, and imaging examinations are performed regularly (including MRI and PET-CT). In the follow-up treatment, it was considered that this patient cannot tolerate the side effects of immunotherapy. Whether hormones affect the efficacy of immunotherapy is currently controversial, so chemotherapy only was considered.\",\n",

Before evaluation, she had tried physical therapy, acupuncture, oral steroids, chiropractic care, gabapentin, and topical analgesics without relief. In addition, she underwent C7-T1 interlaminar injection of steroids with no change in symptoms.\\nInitial noncontrast computed tomography (CT) image demonstrated a bony destructive process involving the right C5 pedicle and superior facet, concerning for an aggressive neoplastic process. Follow-up contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated extradural enhancement along the right side at C4-C6, within the right C5-C6 neuroforamen partially insinuating into the bone. Several MRI sequences also demonstrated flow related artifact within the area of extradural enhancement [Figures 1a and b].\\nAt this time, she had been evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon who initially planned C4-C7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. However, because the MRI suggested vascular lesion, neurovascular consultation and further imaging studies were instead pursued. CT angiography (CTA) was then obtained demonstrating multilevel asymmetric venous epidural enhancement spanning C4-C6 with a focal extradural venous pouch at the C5-C6 level [Figures 1c and d]. This further supported the presence of a vascular lesion, specifically an extradural AVF. Because of this, she then underwent outpatient angiography followed by embolization of the cervical foraminal AVF.\\nThe digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed an AVF supplied from the deep cervical branch of the costocervical trunk. There was a smaller contributor from the inferior thyroid branch of the thyrocervical trunk [Figure 2a].\\nOne week after DSA, she underwent embolization of the fistula. A transradial approach was used with a Bernstein select catheter and a 256 cm 027 Headway microcatheter. The microcatheter was wedged in the distal most part of the deep cervical branch. A single coil was deployed at the neck of the venous varix (distal to the fistula) to prevent filling densely packing the varix with embolic material and preserving its mass effect.

A small amount of free fluids was detected in the Morrison space with a spleen size of 61 mm on midclavicular line. Pelvic and prominent mesenteric lymph nodes were estimated to be up to 4 mm. The infant's upper gastrointestinal (GI) series showed nasopharyngeal regurgitation and compression effect on posterior aspect of esophagus at the level of aorta arc, which was suggestive of double aortic arch or, less probably, aberrant right subclavian artery (Figure 1). A barium meal study revealed severe gastroesophageal reflux, and her small bowel follow through revealed a nodular filling defect in the ileac loops, suggestive of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. Echocardiogram, which was highly recommended due to her barium study results, showed a right-sided aortic arch with a small atrial septal defect (ASD). Cardiac function and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) were reported to be normal. \\nThe patient underwent a multi-slice spiral computerized tomography (CT) angiography of the heart and vasculature using a non-ionic contrast and a saline chaser via dual injector through the intravenous route. Multiple axial and sagittal images with multi-planar reformation (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and volume rendering technique (VRT) reconstruction showed a SDS levo-cardiac heart with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance and intact ventricular septum (IVS) with no sign of permeant ductus arteriosus (PDA). It also revealed a right-sided aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery with notable compression on the esophagus. The main pulmonary artery and its branches were prominent due to a left-to-right shunt. All pulmonary veins returned to the left atrium with no sign of left superior vena cava (LSVC) (Figure 2).\",\n",

Additionally, she had noticed a new onset of pruritic rash over the abdomen, spreading over the trunk. Two weeks prior to the onset of her symptoms, she had presented with dysuria to her primary care physician and was treated with a week's course of ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection, but, despite this, her symptoms persisted.\\nHer past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, lumpectomy for breast cancer, done six years previously, and diverticulosis.\\nOn examination at our institution, her temperature was 37.2  C, her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 156 beats per minute. Positive physical examination findings were a diffuse, predominantly truncal, maculopapular, erythematous rash. This was nonpalpable and nonblanching. Cardiovascular exam was positive for rapid atrial fibrillation. Examination of her lower extremities revealed severe tenderness over both calf areas but no pedal edema. A separate petechial rash was noted over the shins. Abdominal examination revealed no masses, but she demonstrated generalized tenderness on palpation.\\nLaboratory data revealed hemoglobin (Hb) 9.7 g/dL, hematocrit 32.2%, leukocyte count of 9300 cells/UL (differential: granulocytes 91%, lymphocytes 2%, monocytes 6%, and eosinophils 1%), platelets of 276,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 134 mg/dL (normal, 10-20 mg/dL), creatinine, 11.6 mg/dL (her baseline creatinine a month prior to her presentation was 1.1 mg/dL). In addition, her sodium was 125 mmol/L (normal, 135-146 mmol/L); chloride, 88 mmol/L (normal, 96-106 mmol/L); potassium, 4.2 mmol/L (normal, 3.5-5.1 mmol/L); phosphorus, 7.5 mg/dL (normal, 2.7-4.5 mg/dL); and bicarbonate, 18 mmol/L (normal, 24-32 mmol/L). Urine analysis showed specific gravity of 1.010; trace proteins, 3 to 5 dysmorphic red blood cells; no casts and no leucocytes; and glucose, 50 mg/dL. The 24-hour urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio was 797 mcg/mg with a urine creatinine of 30.6 mg/dL. Although there was no peripheral eosinophillia, her urine was positive for eosinophils by Wright's stain. Liver function tests were normal.\\nSerum protein electrophoresis was normal, while her antinuclear antibody and serologies for hepatitis B and C were all negative. Her Complement component3 (C3) was normal at 112 and Complement component 4 (C4) was mildly depressed at 15.1.\\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test for presence of serum myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA); this was found elevated to 54 EU, (normal value is <20 EU). Her P-Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:40.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus was negative, so was the Antinuclear antibody (ANA). C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 22.9 mg/dL and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was >140 mm/hr, the results of tests that were done after the biopsy diagnosis was made.\\nA renal biopsy was performed after admission, and it showed acute necrotizing intrarenal vasculitis with diffuse acute ischemic tubular injury. Low magnification showed an interlobular or arcuate artery showing full-thickness fibrinoid necrosis with luminal occlusion. One glomerulus out of 25 in the specimen showed a fibrocellular crescent and global glomerulosclerosis. The other glomeruli were unaffected. Additionally, there was no evidence of acute interstitial nephritis on the biopsy specimen.\\nAn magnetic resonance image of the brain at that time revealed nonspecific white matter signal changes, likely representing small vessel ischemic disease but vasculitis could not be definitively ruled out. Renal arteriogram was negative for micro aneurysms.\\nGiven her severe uremia, she was placed on intermittent hemodialysis via a split-tip tunneled hemodialysis catheter. In addition, she was started on a daily oral cyclophosphamide at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day and daily oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day initially. Six weeks into her treatment, her creatinine fell to 1.9 mg/dL and intermittent hemodialysis was discontinued (Table 1).\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'Here we describe a 9-year-old girl with microcephaly and mild cerebellar hypoplasia with severe intellectual and motor disability (Fig. 1A,B). She was born full term after an uneventful pregnancy. Parents noticed delay in achieving milestones. She rolled over at 6 months, sat at 12 months and walked at 5 years. She is a happy and social child with global developmental delay. She is ataxic, with motor incoordination in both upper and lower extremities which is more pronounced on left side. She has good core stabilization of the trunk with spinal exaggeration in extensor muscles, suggesting some truncal weakness. She exhibits atypical gait pattern and foot drop during walking and running. In addition, she internally rotates her left lower extremity likely due to decreased tone associated with left hip extensors. From a motor function perspective, she appears to be delayed in both gross and fine motor skills, with greater delays in fine motor abilities. Although she exhibits a clear desire to communicate, there is no verbal communication; only occasionally does she respond with appropriate syllable production. She responds to simple commands and demonstrates some self-stimulation behaviors.\\nIn addition to the psychomotor and intellectual delays described above, the subject also has bilateral epicanthus and bilateral retinal dystrophy. The patient was first seen at the institution for an eye examination at 5 years of age. She had a history of myopia and an oculodigital reflex but no nyctalopia or photosensitivity. Paternal family history was positive for myopia and retinal detachment. Examination showed no paradoxical pupillary constriction in the dark or visual field constriction to confrontation and the optic nerves were pink with a scleral crescent, but the retinal arterioles were attenuated. However, the optic nerve looked normally developed at this stage (Fig. 1C). The girl also had ptosis and epicanthus. In view of the oculodigital reflex and arteriolar attenuation, an ERG was performed that showed severe loss of rod greater than cone photoreceptors, indicating a retinal dystrophy (Fig. 1D-E). She developed photosensitivity and difficulty adapting indoors after being outside. The optic nerves showed evidence of mild to moderate atrophy two years later, but the ERG remained relatively stable. At no time did she have nystagmus or strabismus. Examination remained relatively stable at age 9 years except for an increase in her myopia. She was unable to perform optotype acuity testing. Upon exome sequencing a single mutation in the CASK gene is observed (NM_003688.3(CASK):c.626T>C (p.Leu209Pro); Variation ID: 432816). The variant was not observed in either parent, indicating that the mutation was de novo.\\nThis mutation has been previously reported as a loss-of-function mutation, although the mechanism underlying the pathogenicity is not clear. The substituted leucine in CASK\\'s CaMK domain (Fig. 2A) at position 209 is highly conserved in all species surveyed (Fig. 2B), indicating that it may be a critical part of CASK\\'s primary structure. The leucine is situated in the alphaF helix of the C-terminus lobe of the CaM-kinase domain (Fig. 2D). None of the CaM-kinases in the human kinome contain a cyclic amino acid at this site. A change in the side chain at this position is thus likely to alter intra-molecular interactions and produce secondary and tertiary structural defects. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were done to computationally model the movement of CASK at the atomic level over a period of time at room temperature in an aqueous environment; MD simulations can provide insight into the impact of a mutation on a protein\\'s structure, if an atomic model of the wildtype structure is available. When MD simulations were done on the isolated CaM-kinase structure (a previously solved crystal structure, an analysis of the simulations indicates that the addition of a proline at this position does not destabilize the overall structure of the isolated domain, as indicated by the nearly identical average radii of gyration (19.37398A+- 0.20033 and 19.5173A +- 0.254 for wildtype and CASKL209P, respectively) and root mean square deviation of the backbone relative to the starting structure (1.57455A +-0.31 and 1.52034A +- 0.29 for wildtype and CASKL209P, respectively) over the course of the 100 ns MD trajectories for CASKL209P structure as compared to the wildtype structure (Fig. 2C). MD simulations, by their very nature, yield millions of individual protein conformations, but most of these conformations differ from each other very little. A cluster analysis allows investigators to identify and then examine the most common structure(s) populated during an MD simulation. When the two structures representing the most populated cluster are superimposed using the MatchMaker tool in Chimera, the root mean square deviation between the two structures is 1.252A; for comparison, structures of identical proteins within the Protein Databank can exhibit RMSDs up to 1.2 A, due to variability arising from inherent protein flexibility as well as the resolution limits of the methods used to determine protein structure. From the MD trajectories, calculations of the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the alpha-carbons for both wildtype and CASKL209P were done to, in turn, calculate B-factors at each amino acid position within the CAMK domain. B-factors provide a measure of mobility at a given site, and a comparison between B-factor values by sequence position revealed very few dramatic differences throughout the domain due to the L209P mutation, with the exception of increased mobility in two specific regions (Fig. 2D,E), both located in the activation loop of the CAMK domain: residues 166-168 and 174-176. Both the alphaF helix, where the L209P mutation is located, and the activation loop, which is predicted by the MD simulations to be impacted by the L209P mutation, are considered critical structural components of the core kinase domain, but these changes do not point, in isolation, to a global unfolding of CASK\\'s CAMK domain due to the L209P residue. These simulations are done on an isolated domain of CASK, however, making it impossible to rule out the possibility of disruption of native inter-domain contacts.\\nWe have previously published a simple assay to test structurally unstable CASK mutations. This involves transient over-expression of a GFP-CASK fusion protein using a strong cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Typically GFP-CASK can be visualized using a confocal microscope and is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm but excluded from the nucleus (Figure 3A). Misfolding of CASK leads to formation of visible \"cotton-wool\"-like aggregates in the cytoplasm. Upon overexpression of CASKL209P, aggregates are readily observable, indicating that the protein has a tendency to misfold and aggregate (Figure 3B). In cells where large aggregates are not observed (67%) (Figure 3C), we observe a small punctate distribution not previously seen with the other mutations that we have tested. CASKL209P thus may also be producing much smaller aggregates, thereby resulting in an underestimate of the amount of protein aggregation caused by this mutation. We therefore tested the solubility of CASKL209P by transfecting HEK293 cells with GFP, GFP-CASK and GFP-CASKL209P and solubilizing after 2 days in culture using a solubilizing buffer. Both endogenous CASK and GFP-CASK exhibited a high degree of solubility with little protein left in pellet (Figure 3D). CASKL209P, however, was less soluble, with large amounts remaining in pellet. Thus our data indicate that the L209P mutation results in a propensity for CASK to misfold in a disordered manner, reducing the amount of soluble and possibly functional protein present in the cell.\\nTo determine if the small amount of solubilizable CASKL209P retained any functionality, we examined the biochemical competence of CASKL209P. In previous work, we demonstrated that CASK mutations associated with microcephaly disrupt the interaction between CASK and neurexin. We therefore first tested the interaction between CASKL209P and neurexin in a cellular milieu using a previously described recruitment assay. The assay relies on the ability of membrane-bound neurexin to recruit the cytosolic protein CASK. The recruitment can be easily observed using a confocal microscope in a large, flat cell (with a high cytosolic-to-nuclear ratio) such as HEK293 cells (Figure 4B). Although CASKL209P aggregates in many cells, neurexin is still able to recruit some CASKL209P, indicating that soluble CASKL209P retains its capacity to interact with neurexin (Figure 4D). This finding was confirmed using a GST pull-down experiment (Figure 5A). The cytosolic tail of rat neurexin-1 fused with GST was expressed, purified, and immobilized on glutathione beads. GST-neurexin cytosolic tail (GST-Nx-CT) beads were used to precipitate CASK (both wild-type and CASKL209P) that was expressed in HEK 293 cells. The results from the pull-down experiment confirm that the soluble population of CASKL209P retains its ability to interact with neurexin.\\nCASK is a scaffolding protein involved in an evolutionarily conserved ternary complex with Mint1 and Veli. Veli interacts with CASK via its L27 domain whereas Mint1 interacts with CASK via its CaMK domain. To determine whether CASKL209P is capable of forming this ternary complex, GFP-CASK was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the lysate from these cells was combined with rat brain lysate to allow the exogenous CASK to form complexes with brain-derived proteins (Figure 5B). GFP-CASK was then immunoprecipitated with GFP antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were blotted for Veli and Mint1 (Figure 5D), revealing that CASKL209P can still bind to Veli, but its interaction with Mint1 is disrupted. The L209P mutation in CASK is thus likely to disrupt its regulatory scaffolding function that links neurexin to molecules like Mint1.',\n",

He had multiple prior hospitalizations and was undergoing evaluation for liver transplant. His MELD score was 19 on admission. There was a concern for pneumonia on presentation and he was started on empiric reatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. On hospital day four, he experienced worsening respiratory distress and developed hypoxic respiratory failure. This occurred despite optimal use of diuresis, noninvasive ventilation and paracenteses. He was intubated on hospital day five. On the day of intubation, his total bilirubin was 2.1, serum creatinine 1.65, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.4 and serum sodium of 142 (MELD of 16). Mechanical ventilation was with assist control with tidal volumes of 350 mL, rate of 32, PEEP of 16 on 90% FiO2. Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.25, CO2 of 55, and O2 of 116.\\nAfter intubation, he had progressive and refractory hypoxemia requiring increasing PEEP with high FiO2 to maintain oxygenation. Four days after intubation, he was found to have large apical bilateral pneumothoraces that required emergent bilateral chest tube placement. The development of bilateral pneumothoraces was in part due to increasing PEEP to meet the oxygenation demands. He had progressive coagulopathy during his ICU course as his INR was 4.2 and PT 46.8. It was felt that urgent correction of coagulopathy was required prior to the procedure, and that it should be done without excessive volume administered. Therefore, he was given 2.9 million units of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) (based on weight) and within 1 h following administration his INR was measured at 1.5. Subsequently, bilateral chest tubes were placed. There was an immediate improvement of oxygenation, and there were no bleeding complications. One day after the placement of the bilateral chest tubes the patient died from ongoing hepatic decompensation.',\n",

Prior to transfer, he had received intrathecal methotrexate and oral dexamethasone, as well as vancomycin and cefepime for neutropenic fever and positive blood cultures growing gram-positive cocci. At our institution, the patient was started on GRAALL (Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) 2003 chemotherapy. He received cefepime and vancomycin for persistent neutropenic fevers. Eventually, cefepime was switched to meropenem due to development of multifocal pneumonia during his hospital course. Shortly thereafter, liposomal amphotericin was initiated for presumed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis after a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from a diagnostic bronchoscopy revealed a positive galactomannan antigen; however no organisms were seen on gram stain or identified on culture. He was treated with vancomycin for 8 days and meropenem for 17 days, after which he defervesced. Nevertheless, fevers recurred on hospital day 20 and shortly after; blood cultures returned with gram-negative rods at which point vancomycin and cefepime were reinitiated.\\nThree days later (hospital day 23), the patient reported pain and developed swelling and erythema of his left forearm. On physical examination, the left forearm was swollen, tense, and erythematous, but there were no areas of fluctuance, subcutaneous crepitance, or bullae noted. Duplex ultrasound of the upper extremities showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. However, given the acute onset of pain and swelling, orthopedic surgery was consulted for possible necrotizing infection and compartment syndrome. Laboratory testing disclosed a c-reactive protein (CRP) of 12.90 mg/dL, a white blood cell count of less than 0.1 x 109/L, a sodium of 142 mmol/L, a glucose of 110 mg/dL, a hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, and a creatinine of 0.96 mg/dL, yielding a LRINEC score of 2. It was felt, partly due to this low score, that the patient had a severe cellulitis without necrotizing infection or compartment syndrome. Moreover, based on the patient\\'s clinical picture and the available data at the time, invasive testing for compartment syndrome was deemed unnecessary by the orthopedics service. No additional imaging was ordered at this point. Within 10 hours, the swelling and pain had progressed to his entire left upper extremity (Figure 1) and the patient developed hypotension. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit for refractory septic shock and severe metabolic derangement. At this time, laboratory studies were notable for a CRP of 18.80 mg/dL, a white blood cell count of 0.2 x 109/L, a sodium of 142 mmol/L, a glucose of 116 mg/dL, a hemoglobin of 5.9 g/dL, and a creatinine of 1.06 mg/dL yielding a LRINEC score of 6. The patient continued to clinically decline rapidly despite broadening of his antibiotic regimen (vancomycin, meropenem, gentamicin, and amphotericin B) and was taken to the operating room by the orthopedic surgery service due to concern of a rapidly progressing NSTI.\\nIn the operating room, the entire left upper extremity was prepped, and an initial incision was made over the dorsum of the hand. Exploration of the surrounding tissue revealed necrotic fat, hemorrhagic changes, and gross edema. The expressed fluid was tan but did not have the classic \"dishwater\" appearance of necrotizing fasciitis, nor was it malodorous. The fascia was thickened and opaque. A counterincision was then made proximally over the biceps muscle in the proximal brachium (Figure 2). This region displayed the same tan drainage with associated fat necrosis, and thrombosed vessels were also appreciated in the subcutaneous tissue. Regions of the thickened, diseased-appearing fascia were excised, revealing that the underlying musculature appeared necrotic, noncontractile, and nonviable.\\nAt this point during the procedure, the anesthesiologist noted that multiple vasopressors were being used to maintain the patient\\'s blood pressure, and there was concern that he was clinically deteriorating. Given the extensive involvement of, essentially, the entire limb and the concern that the bacterial load could not be adequately controlled in this hemodynamically unstable patient, the decision was made to proceed with an emergent glenohumeral amputation. The deltoid muscle remained healthy-appearing and contractile, and thus a lateral-based flap composed of the deltoid and overlying skin and soft tissue was planned. Once the amputation was performed, the wound was copiously irrigated using several liters of normal saline to minimize the remaining bacterial load. Hemostasis was subsequently achieved, a drain was placed, and the flap closure was completed. The patient\\'s hemodynamic status improved during closure, and he was transferred back to the intensive care unit for continued care.\\nThe previously drawn blood culture returned on postoperative day (POD) 0, growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures, at which point trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated. Pathology of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of a NSTI, and multiple tissue cultures grew only S. maltophilia. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention, the patient remained persistently bacteremic and in refractory shock despite aggressive medical therapy. On POD1, new necrotic skin areas were noted at the surgical site, and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to evaluate further surgical intervention. The team decided against this, given the patient\\'s very poor prognosis. After discussion with the family, the patient was transitioned to comfort care and passed away shortly thereafter.',\n",

She was presented with severe pain in her left hip and the inability to walk. Her following examination revealed a 30-year-old femoral neck fracture. The option of treatment at that time was an arthrodesis of the left hip. Having presented with the history of trauma, we did not take into consideration a proximal femoral malignancy. However, Ungureanu et al. stated in their study that tumoral growths can be kept hidden under adipose tissue or local swelling located at the thigh level and they could appear concurrently with trauma 3. Therefore, the differential diagnosis was made using the patient history and the CT description given by the radiology specialist. A standard emergency anteroposterior radiograph revealed an intertrochanteric fracture, severe deformity of the left hip joint, and the migrated implants used for the arthrodesis (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the left hip joint showed a displaced intertrochanteric fracture distal to the ankylosed hip joint, some artifacts due to the osteosynthesis material, and marked atrophy of the gluteus muscles (Fig. 2). Due to the rarity of the pathology, several discussions with fellow surgeons were needed to establish what the best therapeutic option was. We decided to perform a surgery to remove the osteosynthesis material used for arthrodesis of the left hip and then perform the internal fixation using a locking plate and locked screws (Fig. 3). The patient was positioned in dorsal decubitus; we used a lateral approach (a skin incision reaching approximately 5 cm proximal and 15 cm distal from what used to be the tip of the greater trochanter). Intraoperative passive mobilization of the limb was realized to outline some intraoperative anatomical landmarks. After initial hardware removal, normal femoral rotation was re-established and checked intraoperatively using the C-arm. A rigid secondary fixation was realized using a locked plate and 13 locking screws. Postoperatively, the patient's evolution was good, and after 2 weeks, she could walk using double crutches.

The lactate of venous blood was measured, showing 3.7 mmol/L at rest (reference range: 0.5-2.2 mmol/L), and the lactic acid after exercise was not obtained because the patient refused to undergo further investigations. The patient was suspected of mitochondrial disease due to the combination of recurrent stroke-like episodes, short stature, hearing loss, and an elevated lactic acid at rest. The blood genetic test suggested a low-frequency (<20%) mutation of m.3243A.G. After being treated with arginine, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 for 1 week, the patient dramatically improved. The muscle strength recovered, and there were no residual psychotic symptoms or aphasia on discharge.\\nThis case study was approved by the institute ethics committee of the Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish the case details.',\n",

His older brother was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001, characterized with enlarged right ventricle and perforated RV, and suddenly died at 16 years old after running in 2007. His mother occasionally had chest tightness. Her ECG reveals T wave inversion in leads of III, V1,V2, and V3, and her Echo revealed a slight decrease of diastolic function, other measurements are in normal range.\\nAbout one month ago, he felt labored dyspnea, and 1 week later he was diagnosed with myocarditis in a local hospital and treated with digoxin, diuretic and myocardium nutrition. Then his symptom released. One week after that, he had dyspnea again and 10 days later was admitted in our pediatric cardiology department. Physical examination showed he was in a general state, Heart Rate 88 bpm, Respiratory Rate 19 bpm, BP 112/72 mmHg, weight 44 kg. No edema on the face and legs, heart sounds strong, without murmur, but rhythm was irregular, auscultation revealed 5 premature beats in 1 min. The liver was 3 cm below right costal margin. Admission blood test revealed normal cTnI, hs-cTnT, CK-MB mass, and NT-pro BNP. Echo showed the right ventricular (RV) was significantly dilated (RV diameter 31.8 mm), RVED/LVED = 0.67, the wall of the RV became thinner, interwoven reticular muscle fiber structure can be seen in the RV (Figure 1). ECG showed epsilon wave and paired PVC (Figure 2a). Holter showed paired PVC and premature atrial contractions (PAC). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI-in local hospital) revealed a dilated right ventricular outflow tract, thin right ventricular wall with reduced wall motion, and foci of fatty deposit in the right ventricular free wall (Figure 1). Genetic testing finds DSG2 mutation (R49H), which has been indicated to be associated with ARVC. The patient was diagnosed of ARVC.\\nHis father rejected the prescription of betaloc as a treatment for its side effect in reducing sexual function. The patient was treated with aspirin (50 mg, qd po), propafenone (200 mg, q8h), enalapril (5 mg qd), furosemide (20 mg qd, oral 4 days a week), and spironolactone (20 mg qd, oral 3 days a week). At admission, his ECG showed QRS was nearly normal, 118 ms (Figure 2a). QRS duration in this article is measured with V5 andII leads. But on the second day after taking oral propafenone, he developed dizziness and his ECG showed QRS was 158 ms. On third day of oral propafenone, QRS was increased to 170 ms (Figure 2b). We reduced the dose of propafenone by half, and on next day, QRS was reduced to 120 ms (Figure 2c). After 1 month treatment, his ECG showed QRS was 164 ms. Therefore, we discontinued propafenone and replaced with sotalol (80 mg, q12 h), and gradually increased the dose to 120 mg. q12 h. At 3 month of illness, QRS was 114 ms; AECG showed PVC 3001/d with paired PVC. Sotalol was then reduced to 80 mg q12 h. At 6 months of illness, QRS returned to normal:ECG showed QRS was 124 ms (Figure 2d). The boy felt better, and the symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain were released.',\n",

Past medical history was significant for pyloric stenosis repair at 4 weeks of age and a prior history of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Family history was noncontributory. His current medication consisted of Humalog Mix 75/25 insulin (Eli Lilly and Company) with the patient receiving approximately 1.3 units of insulin per kilogram body weight. \\nThe patient had no history of jaundice or scleral icterus, and he denied right upper quadrant pain, pruritis, weight loss, ascites, hematemesis, or rectal bleeding. A review of his blood glucose monitoring demonstrated a range of 250-310 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL), and he had a hemoglobin A1c of 12.3% suggesting poor glycemic control. \\nA liver ultrasound showed normal hepatic echotexture and minimal sludge in the gallbladder (Figure 1). A complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, lipid panel, free thyroxine level, and tissue transglutaminase serum IgA level were normal. However, transaminases were elevated with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) consisting of 63 international units per liter (IU/L) and 209 IU/L, respectively. Direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were normal. A viral hepatitis panel, serum ceruloplasmin, and alpha 1-antitrypsin phenotype were normal.

The medical history included a splenectomy after trauma and a posttotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. On admission, tenderness and involuntary guarding were observed in all quadrants of the abdomen. Additionally, the patient developed fever (temperature of 39 C) and was hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg and a heart rate of 120 bpm. On physical examination, skin discoloration was observed around the right side of the abdomen with tense edema. Laboratory tests revealed a C-reactive protein level of 18.0 mg/dL (range, 0-0.30 mg/dL), white blood cell count of 2700/mm3 (range, 3300-8600/mm3), and an elevated serum creatine kinase level of 1977 U/L. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed fluid collection, an air pocket in the subcutaneous fat layer of the abdominal wall, and edematous changes in the adipose tissue in the peritoneum and abdominal wall (Figure 1(a)). Inflammatory changes were observed around the ascending colon (Figure 1(b)). Based on a diagnosis of peritonitis resulting from a perforated ascending colon, an emergency operation was performed. Extensive necrosis of the retroperitoneal fat was observed around the ascending colon where the inflammation was severe. In addition, necrotizing fasciitis was suspected in the abdomen due to an infection caused by the perforated ascending colon. The patient was immediately managed with an intravenous administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (meropenem at 1.5 g/day). A right hemicolectomy, ileostomy construction, and debridement of necrotic tissues were performed (Figure 2(a)). The stump of the ascending colon was closed without colostomy. The pathological findings of the resected specimen revealed peritonitis and ischemic changes, and the ascending colon was noted to be very thin; however, no malignancy was detected. (Figure 2(b)).\\nTwo days following the initial operation, the skin discoloration around the right side of the abdomen reappeared, which indicated widespread necrosis of the abdominal wall fascia (Figure 3(a)). The follow-up CT showed necrotizing fasciitis spreading up to the right lateral chest wall, along the right lateral abdominal wall, and extending to the right groin. A second operation was performed, and the necrotic tissue was debrided from the level of the right abdominal wall to the damaged skin and subcutaneous tissue on the right side of the chest wall (Figure 3(b)). This resulted in a significant abdominal wall defect. The intestine, inferior vena cava, and right kidney were exposed (Figure 3(c)). A closure of the wound defect was planned using the ABThera  System to remove exudate and promote wound healing (Figures 4(a)-4(d)). Under local anesthesia, repeated surgical debridement was performed, and the NPWT dressing was changed 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Following the application of NPWT set at 125 mmHg of continuous negative pressure, extensive debridement and NPWT successfully contributed to the wound bed healing. The size of the open wound with visible granulation tissue significantly reduced with no complications such as an enteric fistula (Figures 5(a)-5(c)). After 4 weeks of NPWT, the wound beds were sufficiently developed for plastic surgery. Finally, the defect in the abdominal wall was covered by a mesh split-thickness skin graft and an anterolateral thigh flap (Figure 5(d)). The patient was discharged 63 days after admission and was regularly followed up at the outpatient department for 6 months without complications (Figure 6).',\n",

Although the skin rash improved, the patient, at times, felt squeezing sensations on her left flank. When the patient was referred to the pain clinic, the patient had a squeezing pain and scars of vesicles on the T10 dermatome level on the left side and her numeric rating scale (NRS) was 5 (out of 10). She felt the squeezing pain several times for approximately one minute each time. Aside from a history of hypertension, there was no other unusual medical history or a history of prior surgeries. She was 152 cm tall and 51.2 kg in weight. Laboratory examinations showed no signs of bacteria or viral infection. Complete blood cell count, prothrombin time and activated partial thrombin time tests showed normal results, and there were no abnormal results in the serologic tests (HBs Ag/Ab, HIV Ag/Ab, quantitive VDRL).\\nAfter diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia, the patient received an epidural block once a week for a total of six weeks. We performed the epidural block with 8 ml of 0.8% mepivacaine with the paramedian approach to T10-T11 with the 'loss of resistance' method. Out of six total procedures, only the first procedure included 20 mg of triamcinolone with local anesthetics, and the rest were composed of local anesthetics only. Any signs or symptoms suggestive of dural puncture, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aspiration through the block needle, headache, paresthesia or sensory impairment were not observed during each epidural block. Pregabalin 150 mg and amitriptyline 5 mg were also prescribed for twice a day. After each epidural block, a pain free period continued for two or three days but she felt numbness like prior to the procedure. Additionally, the squeezing pain reappeared but the pain intensity was reduced to NRS 3. Thus, we expected full recovery by repetitive epidural blocks and by an additional root block or transforaminal epidural block.\\nTwo days after the sixth epidural block, the patient was admitted to the department of neurology, through the emergency department, because the patient felt continuous dizziness and motor weakness in both lower extremities. Five days prior to receiving the sixth epidural block, the patient began to feel slightly dizzy. However, the continual dizziness became extreme by the time the patient was admitted to the hospital. Motor weakness of the lower extremities was felt by the patient two days after the final epidural block. In addition, the patient had symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The patient also could not stand or walk alone. The patient's body temperature was 38.3C and she did not have any abnormalities on her skin. Physical examination showed a grade III motor weakness in both of the lower extremities, but the deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function tests were normal. Sensory impairment was not observed. She was referred to our pain clinic, because a complication during an epidural block was considered by neurologists. We reviewed the sixth epidural block, examining for any evidence of dural puncture, aspiration of blood and other abnormal events, but there were none. However, in order to be certain, we performed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CSF tests on the first day of admission. The MRI showed no signs of hematoma, abscess, or arachnoiditis (Fig. 1). No bacteria were detected upon CSF analysis. Considering the results, we were able to exclude the possibility of an epidural block complication. The CSF analysis results showed, however, a mild increase in the WBC count (49,000 count/mm3) and a protein level of 97 mg/dl. Virus serology test of the blood and the CSF showed negative anti-IgG and negative anti-IgM antibodies for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster. Two days after the patient was admitted, the patient complained of urinary difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted, resulting in discharge of 1,200 ml of urine through the catheter. The patient felt squeezing pain on the T10 dermatome level on the left side during her entire stay at the hospital.\\nConsidering her clinical progressions and the increase in protein level in the CSF analysis, herpes zoster myelitis was diagnosed by the neurologist and appropriate treatments commenced. Three days after the patient was admitted, the patient was given intravenous acyclovir 1.6 g and dexamethasone 20 mg daily for two weeks. The patient also received exercise rehabilitation treatment while she was on the medication. After receiving treatment for one week, the patient was able to walk but had difficulty in standing up. The patient showed gradual improvement and four weeks later made a full recovery in motor function. The patient's urinary difficulty improved through urinary training and she fully recovered in eight weeks.\",\n",

She was hemodynamically stable and with a Glascow Coma Score of 15. Computed tomography of her chest abdomen and pelvis revealed an aortic injury consistent with transection and left hemothorax with associated atelectasis. Her blood pressure was stable, and her hemoglobin and hematocrit were within normal limits. She had several comorbidities which included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, hypertension, history of thyroid cancer status post thyroidectomy, and asthma. \\nShe was admitted to the surgical critical care unit for strict blood pressure control and went to the endovascular suite with vascular surgery the following morning for a thoracic endovascular graft repair of the aortic injury. The case resulted in a midline laparotomy after deployment of the graft, lengthy lysis of adhesions, injury to the left gonadal vein resulting in one liter of blood loss, and finally retroperitoneal dissection and exposure of the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Due to the extensive calcifications of the iliac vessels, the aorta was cannulated and the stent graft was deployed. Her abdomen was closed, and she was returned to the critical care unit.\\nThe patient's course in the critical care unit was long and complicated to include acute respiratory distress syndrome and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Due to high oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure requirements, patient did not undergo a tracheostomy until hospital day number twenty-four. She subsequently had a PEG tube inserted a few weeks later. We continued to attempt to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation. Her Glasgow Coma Score improved significantly over the following weeks to the point she was alert and able to follow commands, attempting to verbalize. However, when patient was placed on tracheostomy collar trials, she became very anxious and tachypneic. This was felt initially to be due to anxiety. After several days of similar symptoms despite anxiolytics, patient developed a wheeze. She had no changes in her chest radiograph. We decided at that time to perform a flexible bronchoscopy and found tracheal collapse distal to the tracheostomy tube.\\nWe ordered a dynamic computed tomography scan of the chest to evaluate the extent of the tracheomalacia. Imaging revealed significant collapse of the distal trachea and main stem bronchi. It was decided to take her for video bronchoscope, rigid bronchoscopy, Dynamic Y-stent placement, and exchange of tracheostomy tube with a regular Shiley size 8 tracheotomy tube (Figure 3).\\nVideobronchoscopy was performed through the distal XLT (Extended Length) tracheostomy tube, and severe tracheobronchomalacia was noticed. The patient had almost complete collapse of the trachea distal to the tracheostomy tube and almost complete collapse of the left mainstem bronchus. Distal XLT tracheostomy tube was exchanged to regular Shiley size 8 tracheostomy tube. Videobronchoscopy was performed through the newly placed Shiley tracheostomy and measurements for the Y-stent taken. Rigid bronchoscopy was then done to ascertain that patient was rigidly intubatable for the deployment of dynamic Y-stent (Figure 2). After successful rigid bronchoscopy Y-stent was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance. The Y-stent limbs were well seated in the trachea left main stem bronchus and right main stem bronchus. \\nPostoperatively patient did well and was able to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. At three-month followup, patient is doing well with tracheostomy and stent in place. The plan is to follow the patient for stent and/or tracheostomy removal or replacement.\",\n",

She has a medical history of renal cell carcinoma, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She had previously undergone an L nephrectomy in 1999 and a hysterectomy in 1990. She denied any previous use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She had a family history of stomach cancer in her mother.\\nThe original pathological diagnosis was mixed clear/granular cell adenocarcinoma, which is now labeled clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC). At the time of diagnosis, the tumor was confined to the kidney, without angiolymphatic invasion. The nuclei were given a Fuhrman grade 4 due to the bizarre and often multinucleated nuclei, with heavy chromatin clumps and prominent nucleoli. One lymph node was examined and found to be negative for malignancy. Because the tumor was 7.8 cm in greatest dimension and limited to the kidney, it was a pathologic stage pT2a. In November 2016, the patient underwent a fine needle aspiration of her right thyroid. The specimen was adequate with follicular epithelial cells and scattered colloid, consistent with a benign follicular nodule. There was no evidence of malignancy; however, sampling bias is always an issue.\\nWith the recently reported increase in size, a repeat ultrasound was completed by her endocrinologist, and she was found to have a large right-sided nodule that was hypervascular measured 5.7 x 3.4 x 4.5 cm, and had increased in size from her previous ultrasound in 2018. She also noted occasional dysphagia. Her thyroid function testing reported normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine. She denies any hoarseness or difficulty breathing. She was notified during the examination that she has a large nodule within the right thyroid that was irregular but without tenderness.\\nThe patient underwent a right-lobe partial thyroidectomy in June 2020. The history of CC-RCC was noted in previous pathology reports. The gross examination of the resected specimen demonstrated a \"well-circumscribed golden-yellow-tan mass\" in which there were areas of hemorrhage present. Histologic sections showed a partially encapsulated, nodular proliferation composed of monotonous, intermediate-sized cells, embedded within benign thyroid parenchyma (Figure 1). At higher power examination, the mass is composed of clear cells with centrally located nuclei, prominent nuclei, and abundant vascular capillary network (\"chicken wire\") characteristic of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Figure 2). Immunohistochemical stains were performed to further evaluate the site of origin for the neoplastic cells. The renal markers PAX8 and RCC were positive, while the parathyroid and thyroid markers (PTH and TTF1) were negative. Pancytokeratin was focally reactive and the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin was negative excluding an endocrine neoplasm. The morphologic and immunohistochemical features of this neoplasm, along with her known history, were most consistent with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\\nThe patient\\'s PET/CT scan did not demonstrate any signs of residual or metastatic disease. Due to her advanced age and the 21 years between her initial disease and metastatic disease, our multidisciplinary tumor board elected to observe the patient with repeat PET in 4 months and not initiate chemotherapy at this time.',\n",

He was able to walk initially and was taken to a local dispensary where he was administered an intramuscular analgesics and discharged. The next morning, he lost function of both lower limbs with associated weakness of bilateral upper limbs as well and could not get out of bed and this prompted the family to seek further medical attention. He was taken to the same facility again and advised to start physiotherapy with a provisional diagnosis of lumbar spondylitis. He was referred when he developed facial paresis bilaterally and an altered level of consciousness associated with an increased respiratory rate. In the emergency department, the mother provided the additional information of the low grade fever and cough from the week before which they had managed conservatively at home.

Bedside ultrasound revealed good cardiac contractility with a full Inferior vena Cava [IVC] and no pericardial or pleural effusion.\\nGiven the existing epidemiological scenario and preceding symptoms of fever and cough, COVID-19 infection was suspected. Appropriate isolation precautions were implemented, and a respiratory viral panel testing [nasopharyngeal PCR] was sent. Antibiotic coverage was done empirically and other treatment modalities done as required. Just prior to transfer to Pediatric Intensive Care [PICU], child lost pulse and Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation [CPR] was initiated with return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] achieved within 1 cycle of the CPR. Child was intubated and ventilated and started on positive inotrope infusion. A diagnosis of GBS was made and patient was immediately started on 400mg/kg of intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] therapy for a planned 5-day course according to clinical manifestations related to GBS. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] for COVID-19 was positive and further evaluation and management was continued in the ICU. Given the classic clinical picture of GBS in absence of other identifiable etiology for his neurologic disease and strict infection control measures, additional supportive testing was not pursued. His clinical course showed improvement in his respiratory status, neurological status as well as his consciousness level with an improvement of the GCS to 14/15 within 5 days. Neurologically, his upper extremity weakness resolved after completion of the course of IVIG. Lower extremity power and tone improved significantly. He was planned for weaning off ventilation and extubation on day 6, and eventual rehabilitation and discharge. During the night preceding the planned weaning, the child self extubated accidentally and rapidly decompensated.

The mitotic activity was moderate (3-5/10HPF). The tumor was seen infiltrating into the underlying subcutis. Diagnosis of DFSP was made. A panel of immunohistochemistry (IHC) comprising vimentin and CD-34 was applied. Tumor cells were positive for both vimentin and CD-34 (Figure 5).',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 23-year-old male presented to the primary care clinic to establish care after relocating to Arizona. His past medical history was significant for severe, mostly spontaneous, keloid formation since puberty. He complained of a right ring finger mass and a left ring finger deformity, bilateral foot pain, and worsening keloids and skin nodules.\\nOver the last four months, he had noticed a spontaneous, slowly enlarging mass on his right ring finger. It bothered him when directly pressed upon or during rock climbing. There were no associated neurological symptoms, redness, or erythema. He also reported a contracture in the left ring finger over the last six months. He had undergone a left small finger proximal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis for presumed camptodactyly at age 16. This surgery was complicated by fibromatosis and keloid scar formation, ultimately leading to amputation of the small finger. He now complained of excessive scar formation at that amputation site.\\nHe gave a two-year history of bilateral forefoot pain. His right fourth toe was the most painful. He reported that this toe had become very stiff over this time. Other toes were involved as well, and prolonged standing exacerbated the symptoms. He did not report any redness, warmth, or swelling. He denied any acute joint pain episodes and hand or back pain.\\nWith respect to his keloids and skin nodules, he had had them since puberty. He noted that some were related to sites of minor trauma, and others were spontaneous. He had multiple large keloids involving the chest, back, arms, and legs. Recently, some had involved the toes as well. He denied any genital involvement. Past treatments included intralesional steroid injections and radiation therapy with temporary improvements.\\nHe was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol socially. He was an avid rock-climber. His family history was significant for keloid formation in his grandfather. A maternal cousin had rheumatoid arthritis. On review of systems, he denied any fatigue, morning stiffness, night sweats, weight loss, inflammatory eye disease, cough, shortness of breath, back pain, nephrolithiasis, Raynaud's phenomenon, or blood dyscrasias. He did not take any chronic medications.\\nOn examination, he was afebrile with normal vital signs and appropriate weight. There was no glandular swelling or gingival hypertrophy. Hand examination showed severe left ring finger proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture of 80 , with palmar fibromatosis and keloid scar formation (Figures 1 and 2). There was no intrinsic degeneration of the PIP joint on X-ray or MRI. The right ring finger demonstrated a firm and immobile mass extending for the length of the middle phalanx on the ulnar aspect. Ring finger movement was intact. At the distal aspect of his prior amputation, he had a thickened scar. Mild tenderness to flexion and extension of his bilateral fourth and fifth digits was present. He had prominent fifth metatarsal heads bilaterally which were tender to palpation. Ankle and subtalar joint exam was normal. Ambulation was unrestricted. Multiple large areas of hypertrophic scarring and keloid formation involving the central chest (Figure 3), arms, and legs as well as some discrete nodules on the upper back were present.\\nLaboratory testing was unremarkable. He tested negative for rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibody, HLA-B27 gene, and hepatitis serology. Routine laboratory markers including complete blood count, renal function, liver function, thyroid and parathyroid gland function, and uric acid and urinalysis were normal. A chest radiograph was unremarkable. A right hand X-ray film showed nonspecific soft tissue swelling of the right ring finger. The left hand film showed amputation of the small finger at the level of the proximal to mid fifth metacarpal and a flexion deformity of the ring finger at the PIP joint. Sacroiliac joints showed minimal degenerative changes on X-rays. Feet radiographs showed multiple erosions. Axial (Figure 4) and coronal (Figure 5) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the feet obtained with gadolinium contrast administration demonstrated marginal erosions, synovitis, and bone marrow enhancement. Enhancing inflammatory changes in the plantar soft tissues and heterogeneous enhancement of keloids was also seen.\\nTo treat the contracture, the patient underwent a left ring finger palmar fasciectomy. Operative findings included severe fibromatosis of the left middle and ring finger and keloid formation that was confirmed by histopathology. After excision of diseased palmar fascia, the finger was able to be fully extended. A residual skin deficit required skin grafting for closure. The entire palmar surface of the proximal phalanx was resurfaced with a full thickness skin graft. His nonoperative skin lesions were treated with a combination of intralesional methylprednisolone, 5-fluorouracil, and pulsed dye laser treatments. He was initiated on 15 mg of oral methotrexate for his erosive disease.\\nAggressive occupational therapy was pursued after the surgery. At six-month follow-up, he reported improvement in his joint pain as well as keloids. The ring finger PIP joint flexion contracture had improved from 80  to 35 . However, continued keloid formation persisted over the surgical scars. His skin graft healed completely. Due to the scarring and keloids, no further surgery was recommended.\",\n",

She was diagnosed with left breast cancer the following year and underwent breast conservation surgery and radiotherapy. She was placed on anastrazole therapy thereafter and followed regularly with her oncologist. Her recent imaging studies did not demonstrate new disease.\\nThe patient's initials symptoms were irritation of her left eye, and after seeing her primary care provider, she was started on tobramycin eye drops (0.3% solution, every 2-3 h) for a possible ocular infection. Three days after initiating tobramycin she began experiencing diplopia, generalized weakness (primarily in the neck), and increasing respiratory distress. The patient did not recall ever having symptoms like this before and denied a history of MG. Her laboratory studies were significant for AchR-binding antibody positive at 82 nmol/L, AchR-blocking antibody positive at 56% inhibition, AchR-modulating antibody positive at 95% inhibition, and a positive striate muscle antibody titer of 1:160. A computed tomography of her chest did not show the presence of a thymoma in the mediastinum.\\nThe patient was started on pyridostigmine therapy with improvement of her symptoms. However, while she initially responded well to pyridostigmine, she begin experiencing increasing weakness and fatigue after receiving intravenous and oral magnesium the following day, despite an increase in the dosage of pyridostigmine. She subsequently underwent six cycles of plasma exchange therapy with improvement in her symptoms however she did not tolerate nasal cannula for long periods of time. She continued to require pressure support ventilation via facemask throughout her admission. Her long-term plan was to undergo weekly PLEX therapy for 3-6 months at a long-term acute care facility, with continued ventilator support through a tracheostomy.\\nUnfortunately the patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate as she developed an upper GI bleed, developed a significant anemia due to blood loss, and was intubated for respiratory failure due to prolonged periods of apnea. Shortly thereafter she went into a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and underwent 30 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Her family made the decision to withdraw care and she died shortly after.\",\n",

The contralateral right breast was normal in appearance as well as on palpation.\\nInitial chest radiograph (Figure 2a) showed a multilobulated soft tissue density lesion involving the left breast. Bilateral lung fields and the bony thoracic cage appeared normal. On ultrasound (Figure 2b), the lesion appeared as a circumscribed, multilobulated, heteroechoic solid lesion, with internal vascularity on colour Doppler (Figure 2c). As the lesion was massive in size and could not be adequately assessed by radiography or ultrasound, the patient was referred for CT scan of the chest for further evaluation. Post-contrast CT scan of the chest (Figures 3 and 4) revealed a heterogeneously enhancing aggressive lesion measuring 21 x 15 x 13 cm with central areas of necrosis, with evidence of sternal erosion and invasion of the pericardium.

He also complained of heaviness and stiffness of both lower limbs while walking. He was taking multiple stuttering in-place steps before starting, and was walking in broad base with hesitant steps with difficulties in turning. He used bizarre dance-like bilateral upper limb movements to compensate and steer forward (Video 1). The problem increased when he was given a mental task like counting backwards from 100. A graduate, he was born of non-consanguineous marriage of Indian parentage with normal birth and developmental history.\\nHe scored 82 in Addenbrooke\\'s Cognitive Examination and 15 in Frontal Assessment Battery. He showed mild attentional deficit and poor delayed recall in word list memory task, that improved with cues with preserved other cognitive domains. His examination revealed slurred speech, mild spasticity of four limbs, normal limb power with brisk deep tendon reflexes (DTRs). He could perform complicated coordinated motor activities by lower limbs while lying down like drawing numbers in the air or cycling in midair (Video 2). However, his gait problem did not improve with visual cues. His MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of brain showed bilateral posterior predominant periventricular white matter hyperintensities in T2 and FLAIR sequences suggestive of leukodystrophy (Figure 1A-E and 1I-L). Investigations including complete blood count, blood biochemical parameters, serum lactate, creatinine phosphokinase, electrocardiogram and 2D echocardiogram were normal. Tests for arylsulphatase A, urinary metachromatic granules and very long chain fatty acids came negative.

In this case study, we aimed to seek alternative indications for Capecitabine. We searched for Capecitabine with RxCUI \"194000\" from the CPN to identify novel indications. In total, there are 120 disease nodes that are at most 3 nodes away from Capecitabine. Of these 120 diseases, 12 possible novel indications including Hyperbilirubinemia, Mesothelioma, Bladder Neoplasm, etc. associated with Capecitabine are supported by published studies. The following example illustrates the identification process of the new indication, bladder neoplasm for Capecitabine.\\nFrom the CPN 50 directly relevant nodes have been retrieved for Capecitabine including the gene CYP1A1, from which \"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms\" have been identified subsequently. A sub-network of Capecitabine visualized by Cytoscape in the CPN is shown at the right lower corner in Figure 1, where the edges in red indicate all associations with Capecitabine, and the green edges indicate DPYD and C18orf56 are linking to Capecitabine respectively. The zoomed out network is shown in Figure 3. The association between \"Urinary Bladder Neoplasms\" and \"Capecitabine\" could be inferred through multiple paths as shown in Figure 3. Among all paths between these two, the shortest path is Capecitabine-CYP1A1-Urinary Bladder Neoplasms, of which the association could be proved by literatures: (1) \"CYP1A1 rs1048943 A > G (Ile462Val) polymorphism is a potential prognostic marker for survival outcome after docetaxel plus capecitabine chemotherapy\"; (2) active CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 overexpression is revealed in bladder cancer; (3) the combination of Capecitabine and radiation therapy offers a promising treatment option for bladder cancer patients who are not candidates for surgery or cisplatin-based chemotherapy; (4) a patient with metastatic bladder cancer responded well to second-line capecitabine with a clinically meaningful progression-free survival. Through this validation chain, the inference that the breast and colorectal cancer drug, \"Capecitabine\" might be used for urinary bladder cancer could be made. Evidently urinary bladder cancer may be a novel indication of Capecitabine via the network-based analysis of the CPN.',\n",

Initially, the patient\\'s condition was misdiagnosed as \"lumbar disc herniation\" in the local hospital, and she received conservative treatment. However, her symptoms did not improve and became more serious. When referred to our hospital, she complained of inability to walk and bladder and bowel control loss. A neurological examination revealed a diminished sensation below the T7 level. The strength of both lower limb muscles was 1/5. Her neurological status was diagnosed as Nurick Grade 6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple intradural extramedullary tumors at the T7-T11 level compressing the spinal cord (Figure 1A). Computed tomography (CT) scans showed five high-density masses of varying sizes in the spinal canal at the T7-T12 level, and the dural sac was significantly compressed (Figures 1B,C). Three large high-density masses (13.4 mm*8.4 mm, 21.7 mm*13.0 mm, and 14.9 mm*12.5 mm) were observed in the T7-T9 segment, located in the dorsal left rear spinal cord with clear boundaries and ossification signals (Figures 1D-F). The other two high-density masses (8.7 mm*5.3 mm and 11.1 mm*6.73 mm) of different sizes were found in the T10-T12 segment.\\nThe patient underwent tumor resection through T7-T11 laminectomy. The tumors occupied >90% of the transverse diameter of the spinal canal and were entirely ossified. As the vertebral fenestration was too small, it was challenging to remove the tumors. Hence, the bilateral facet joints were removed to enlarge the window. To maintain the stability of the spine, we performed T7-T12 long-segment pedicle screw fixation and posterolateral bone graft fusion simultaneously. Bilateral facetectomy provides advantages over simple laminectomy or laminoplasty in terms of width of the operative corridor and long-term preservation of the spinal alignment. As the dura mater had severely adhered, a fine right-angled hook was used to dissect the neural tissue dorsally away from the neoplasms, which were then resected en bloc, together with parts of the dura mater and arachnoid. After a complete separation of multiple OSMs, the dura mater became normal and it was sutured. The drainage was routinely placed, and the wound was closed layer by layer.\\nThe paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H/E). A histopathological examination revealed a large number of psammoma bodies in the stroma with significant signs of ossification [World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I]. In addition, there were many mature bone tissues around the tumor cells, including trabecular bone, as well as bone marrow with hematopoiesis (Figures 2A-C). Immunohistochemical findings revealed EMA (+), Vim (+), P53 (-), S-100 (+), and Ki67 (approximately 5%) (Figures 3D-F).\\nPostoperative neurological improvement was significant, and no complications were found. The patient was discharged 2 weeks after surgery. After the 2-year follow-up, she was able to walk without assistance. Her neurological status recovered to Nurick Grade 3. CT scans showed a total resection of the tumors, and there was no recurrence 2 years after surgery (Figures 3A-E).',\n",

Despite antibiotic treatment, serial examination showed the vision loss progressed to 6/60 in both eyes by June 2014 (Table 1).\\nOn review in July 2014, 4 months after diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, visual loss had progressed further to 2/60 (right) and 3/60 (left), optic nerve pallor had increased, and a central scotoma had developed in both eyes. Lumbar puncture showed CSF weakly reactive to T. pallidum antibodies (EIA, fluorescent) and T. pallidum particle agglutination. Skin biopsy showed non-specific IgE, IgM and C3 immunofluorescence in the basement membrane and dermis. He was diagnosed with autoimmune optic neuropathy, re-admitted to hospital and treated with a second course of IV benzylpenicillin after repeat desensitisation, together with IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily given his earlier lack of response to penicillin, along with a 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily. He commenced immunosuppression and was discharged taking a tapering course of oral prednisolone, initially 75 mg daily, oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 28 days and azathioprine 75 mg daily, and 1 month later given a 3-day course of IV immunoglobulin (Octagam 5% 45 g daily).\\nWhen last reviewed, there had been no response to sustained immunosuppression. Visual acuity was 3/60 bilaterally and optic discs were atrophic. Pupils remained non-responsive to both light and accommodative targets. The patient withdrew from medical care and ceased all treatment.\\nOur patient has CSF-positive neurosyphilis with bilateral optic neuropathy and tonic pupils. Although he presented with only 8 weeks of visual symptoms, it is possible that the seemingly typical microvascular 6th nerve palsy 1 year earlier was early neurosyphilis. He denied risk factors and was not tested for syphilis at the time. Notwithstanding the uncertain onset of infection, his optic nerve function was normal at presentation with cranial nerve palsy, and he was treated appropriately within 8 weeks of first optic neuropathy symptoms with two courses of IV penicillin, IV high-dose steroids, and subsequent immunosuppression, but suffered progressive visual loss in the right followed by left eye with optic atrophy.\\nWe hypothesise his progressive visual loss was due to the development of autoimmune optic neuropathy. This is supported by the relentless course despite appropriate treatment confirmed on serological response, skin biopsy positive for immunoreactant deposition, the most consistent marker of autoimmune optic neuropathy, and the development of autoantibodies (cardiolipin IgG, anti-smooth muscle). Multiple reports have linked post-infectious immune dysregulation with the development of autoimmune disease targeting the nervous system and the optic nerve. Syphilis is well known to induce autoantibody production. Although not all autoantibodies are necessarily pathogenic, this supports our case for autoimmune optic neuropathy complicating our patient\\'s syphilitic optic neuropathy.\\nOphthalmologists play an important role in diagnosing ocular and neurosyphilis. A high index of suspicion is necessary. Patients with syphilitic optic neuropathy need to be warned that visual loss may develop despite optimum therapy. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of visual loss in patients with syphilis.\\nThe authors have no ethical conflicts to disclose.',\n",

The patient reported that she vomited after every meal, and vomitus mainly consisted of undigested food particles without blood. The patient also had intermitted constipation; however, she had no diarrhea. She also observed substantial weight loss despite good appetite but was unable to quantify the weight loss. The patient did not take any medications for her migraine headaches and her last flare-up was about 1 year ago. She reported multiple outpatient visits for similar complaints in the last 2 months; however, on this visit with her primary care provider, she was referred to the hospital. On clinical evaluation, she had stable vital signs. Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes and abdominal examination was positive for mild epigastric tenderness along with decreased bowel sounds. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) fluids. Laboratory investigations such as complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were ordered, which revealed a low hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, hematocrit 30.2%, serum sodium 132 mEq/L, and serum potassium 3.3 mEq/L. An abdominal X-ray did not reveal mechanical obstruction. Due to concerns for gastroparesis (GP) as the underlying etiology, a Gastric Emptying Study was ordered, which revealed markedly delayed gastric emptying time as the tracer was distributed in the stomach on initial views with activity not appearing in the duodenum until 45 minutes and emptying half time was not reached with 77% of initial gastric contents remaining at the end of the examination. Hence, a diagnosis of GP was established. The patient was started on metoclopramide, which led to improvement of her presenting symptoms, and she was eventually discharged home with recommendations to taper the doses of metoclopramide as needed.\\nOne month after discharge, the patient presented to the hospital with similar complaints as her initial presentation despite metoclopramide therapy. Laboratory investigations were similar to initial hospitalization and revealed hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit 31.9%, serum sodium 133 mEq/L, and serum potassium 3.2 mEq/L. An abdominal X-ray was ordered, which revealed dilated bowel segments with high burden of stool in the colon without obvious mechanical obstruction. A diagnosis of severe GP and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) was established. Over the next month, the patient was given an extensive trial of numerous prokinetic agents such as mirtazapine, ondansetron, pyridostigmine, octreotide, and promethazine, but she failed to show clinical improvement. With failure of medical therapy, a nasojejunal feeding tube was placed for nutrition; however, the patient noted worsening nausea despite the slow feeding rate of 10 mL/h. Hence, after detailed discussions with the patient, a decision was made to start her on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after which she was transferred to a tertiary center for higher level of care. At the tertiary care center, she was continued on TPN and underwent extensive evaluation. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits except mild elevation of the liver enzymes. Additionally, antinuclear antibody, extractable nuclear antigens panel, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies were found to be negative, thereby ruling out an autoimmune etiology. A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed the presence of gallbladder sludge and normal liver architecture. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were found to be negative. A small bowel follow-through ruled out mechanical obstruction. Magnetic resonance enterography and computed tomography angiography of the abdomen were noted to be unremarkable. Furthermore, a deep rectal biopsy was performed, which was negative for amyloidosis. However, antroduodenal manometry, a diagnostic tool for GI motility disorders, showed paucity of contractile activity with very low amplitudes highly suggestive of a myopathic etiology. This was followed up with a laparoscopic full-thickness intestinal biopsy, which revealed decreased actin staining in the circular muscles of the muscularis propria of small intestine consistent with a diagnosis of HVM. During the course of the hospital stay, the patient developed recurrent bacteremia, the source of which was identified to be the central venous catheter used for TPN. She was treated with appropriate antibiotics, which led to resolution of the bacteremia. Eventually, she underwent isolated small intestine transplant and was started on mycophenolate 500 mg daily, everolimus 5 mg daily, and prednisone 10 mg daily. This led to eventual resolution of her presenting symptoms, and she was discharged home.

Five treatments of TPE were performed every other day, alternating treatment days with IV methylprednisolone. The patient tolerated her therapy well and had progressive improvement in her neurologic symptoms with near complete resolution of her tetraparesis and mild residual sensory loss in her left arm. She was discharged to the acute rehabilitation service.\\nFor the reminder of her pregnancy, she was treated with methylprednisolone 1000 mg as a single infusion every 3 weeks. She presented to the hospital at 36 weeks' gestation with contractions, vaginal spotting, hypertension, headache, and lower extremity edema.

       "    'case_text': 'We found that the number of quadrants visualized positively correlated with age, confirming that younger patients are more difficult to image. Younger patients may be less cooperative. Positioning in the chin rest and fixating on a target can be challenging. Most quadrants could be captured by obtaining serial images with positive encouragement and assistance from the parents. Several patients aged 3-4 years old were included in our study to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring high quality images at an early age. We feel that the child friendly protocol developed in our Medical Photography department at UCLA increases the success rate of pediatric retinal imaging. Interestingly, 2 patients with nystagmus were successfully imaged in our study. Our findings corroborate those of previous case reports suggesting ultra-wide field imaging of patients with nystagmus is possible due to the rapid (0.25 s) image acquisition time.\\nWe also found more quadrants of the retina were visualized during the later phases of UWF-FA.\\nChildren often require consolation following a needle stick for the fluorescein dye resulting in an increased time to image capture and difficulty in capturing choroidal filling. In addition, the delay in positioning the patient in the chin rest results in increased artifacts in the early phases. If the early phase of angiography is of interest, intravenous access can be acquired prior to injecting fluorescein which can eliminate the transition time. In addition, Ali et al. described using oral fluorescein as an alternative to intravenous dye to obtain UWF-FA in children.\\nUWF-FAF was useful in capturing abnormal autofluorescence patterns in the macula and the periphery. Increased or attenuated autofluorescence patterns involved the periphery in 23 of 24 (96%) patients highlighting the usefulness of capturing the peripheral retina with UWF imaging. UWF-FAF has been described in case reports previously in Stargardt disease, pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy, and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase retinal dystrophy. The peripheral extent of lesions and autofluorescence patterns may be useful to diagnose heredodegenerative disorders and monitor disease activity, particularly in inflammatory conditions.\\nLastly, in our series, the indications for obtaining imaging were quite varied as seen in Table 1 which reflects the heterogenous nature of pediatric retinal disease. In addition, in children who reported floaters or visual disturbances with a normal eye exam, UWF imaging was useful to confirm and document a normal funduscopic examination. Several studies have demonstrated that UWF is useful as a screening modality for diabetic retinopathy with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100% between UWF imaging and clinical examination. The use of UWF imaging as a screening modality can be applied to the pediatric retinal population as well.\\nSimilarly, UWF-FA was particularly useful to confirm lack of activity or guide targeted panretinal photocoagulation in retinal vascular diseases. Moreover determining if a child who was previously treated requires additional treatment can be challenging. A negative UWF-FA, meaning one without significant ischemia or leakage, can guide the decision to observe with serial examinations and photographs and eliminate the need for an exam under anesthesia as shown in Fig. 4. On the contrary, a UWF-FA with active leakage or neovascularization as in a patient with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or Coats disease may indicate the need for additional panretinal photocoagulation (Fig. 5).\\nThis study is limited by its retrospective nature. Another limitation of UWF-FA is that early vascular filling may not be imaged due to transition time from injection to photography. In addition, the periphery may be obscured by lash or nose artifacts. However, a strength of our study is the relatively large number of subjects included and we overcame challenges in positioning with coaching and parent involvement.\\nFuture prospective studies can be considered to evaluate the time it takes to image subjects by age and compare UWF imaging with standard non-wide field cameras in the pediatric population. In addition, cost/benefit analysis of population screening in children using UWF technology can be considered.',\n",

The fluid was removed from the reservoir, and the patient was treated conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. After 2 weeks of treatment the patient's symptoms improved. After careful consideration, she wished to undergo revisional surgery converting the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. The patient moved through the appropriate multidisciplinary team approach and was found to be an appropriate candidate for surgery. She underwent laparoscopic removal of the adjustable gastric band and conversion to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy without complications. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged on post-operative day 3.\\nOn post-operative day 12, the patient was readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital for lightheadedness and shortness of breath and was found to have leukocytosis, with white blood cell count of 18,000 cells mul-1. The work-up included a CT scan with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and the patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. The patient was immediately transferred to our centre for definitive care. When the patient arrived at our centre, the CT films from the outside hospital were reviewed by our radiologists and there was concern that there was air and a faint suggestion of oral contrast outside of the suture line (Figure 1). Given this finding, an UGI evaluation was ordered. During the early phase, no leak was observed, owing, in part, to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast (Figure 2a). Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and with administration of additional non-ionic contrast for a total of about 65 ml (approximately 2 h after the start of the fluoroscopic examination) was there a faint suggestion of extravasated contrast, best seen below the left hemidiaphragm (Figure 2b). Follow-up CT scan with oral contrast confirmed the obvious leak (Figure 3).\\nThe patient was treated definitively with endoscopic stent placement and clipping using an Ovesco clip (Ovesco Endoscopy AG, Tubingen, Germany) to close the leak.

Forty months after a right breast mastectomy, CT revealed anterior mediastinal lymph node recurrence (Fig. 3a). Hence, we considered the recurrence of NECB and decided to initiate chemotherapy to prevent further recurrence. Based on the past literature on the chemotherapy dosage for patients on HD, a chemotherapy regimen with six cycles of FEC 100 - consisting of fluorouracil (5-FU, 500 mg/m2), epirubicin (EPI, 70 mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (CPA, 350 mg/m2) - and three cycles of docetaxel (DTX, 60 mg/m2) was initiated (Table 1). After the third course of DTX treatment, grade 3 neutropenia was observed; hence, the chemotherapy was discontinued. CT was performed after the chemotherapy and anterior mediastinal lymph node recurrence was not detected (Fig. 3b). The patient responded well to the chemotherapy. Forty-two months after the chemotherapy, no tumor recurrence was detected on CT.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"An 85-year-old man with pancytopenia was diagnosed with MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD) based on bone marrow aspiration (BMA), which revealed 2.6% myeloblasts with trilineage dysplasia and normal karyotype. Based on these findings, the case was categorized as intermediate-1 or low risk according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) or Revised IPSS (IPSS-R), respectively. At this point, the patient had been treated with vitamin K2 (menatetrenone) and active vitamin D3 (calcitriol) because combination therapy of these two drugs was reported to be effective against low-risk MDS. At 87 years of age, the patient undertook BMA again because his pancytopenia had progressed, and he was diagnosed with MDS with excess blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2) based on the BMA findings, which revealed 11% myeloblasts and multilineage dysplastic changes of bone marrow cells (Figures 1(a)-1(d)), with a normal karyotype. The disease status was categorized as intermediate-2 risk according to the IPSS and high risk according to the IPSS-R; thus, AZA treatment was initiated on hospitalization at the standard dose of 75 mg/m2/day, subcutaneously, for 7 days every month. The patient achieved a hematological improvement (HI) with manageable adverse events (AEs), including constipation and general malaise after the first cycle of AZA. The second cycle was therefore administered in an outpatient setting. However, the treatment was discontinued due to septic shock after the second cycle of AZA. The patient became dependent on red blood cell (RBC) transfusions due to a clinical progression of MDS because one year after the discontinuation of AZA (at 88 years of age), we did not perform any histological examinations, such as BMA. Therefore, additional 3 cycles of AZA were administered in an outpatient setting with a reduced dose of 37.5 mg/m2 (50% dose reduction) daily. The dose of AZA was decided according to the prescribing information for AZA based on the nadir absolute neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/L in the preceding (second) cycle. Treatment with AZA was discontinued again because the patient refused to continue the treatment due to the AEs, which included constipation and general malaise, as well as the inconvenience of going to the hospital.\\nAt eight months after the second discontinuation of AZA (at 89 years of age), a painful cutaneous tumor, the top of which showed yellow-colored necrosis (Figure 2(a)), developed at the left groin lesion. Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cell count, 2,900/muL, with 63.6% neutrophils, 32.6% lymphocytes, 3.5% monocytes, 0.3% eosinophils, and no blast cells; hemoglobin, 6.6 g/dL; platelet count, 8.7 x 104/muL; and C-reactive protein, 0.57 mg/dL. No treatments, including oral and topical antibiotics, topical tacrolimus hydrate, and analgesics, had any effect on the tumor. A biopsy of the tumor was performed one month after its development. Histological examination revealed the proliferation of tumor cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (Figure 3(a)). Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for myeloperoxidase (Figure 3(b)), partially positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 68 (Figure 3(c)) and CD33, but negative for CD3, CD4 (Figure 3(d)), CD20, CD34, CD56, CD117, and CD123 (Figure 3(e)). A diagnosis of MDS-associated MS was made. One month after the development of the first cutaneous lesion, another cutaneous tumor appeared on the left cheek (Figure 2(b)). BMA revealed a hypercellular marrow with 25% myeloblasts, which were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34, and HLA-DR; a G-band analysis revealed a normal karyotype. A diagnosis of AML secondary to MDS was made.\\nConsidering the patient's age, clinical conditions, and the previously experienced AEs, treatment with AZA was started again at a dose of 37.5 mg/m2/day, subcutaneously, for 7 days every 4-6 weeks (in total, this was the 6th cycle of AZA treatment) during short-term hospitalization, which consisted of 9 days of inpatient treatment per cycle, in order to manage the acute-phase AEs caused by AZA. The cutaneous MS lesion located on the left groin (Figures 4(a)-4(c)) and that on the left cheek (Figures 4(d)-4(f)) promptly disappeared after the 6th and 7th cycles of AZA treatment. Although myeloblasts had appeared in peripheral blood after several cycles of retreatment with AZA, the treatment was continued because of persistence of the response on MS, and the pain caused by his lesions remained relieved, with tolerable AEs, by AZA. The patient had received 16 cycles (over a 22-month period) of AZA treatment with the same dose on repeated short-term hospitalization until he died of progression of AML. He eventually received 21 cycles of AZA treatment in total. No exacerbation of cutaneous MS had been confirmed during AZA treatment.\",\n",

She also had left leg lymphoedema and complained of having poor appetite, fatigue, and lost 4 kg within 4 weeks. Patient denied having fever and night sweats. All these difficulties lasted approximately 1 month. Complete blood count (CBC) showed mild anaemia while all other laboratory findings were within normal limits. Also, HBV, HCV and HIV serology were negative. Colour doppler of lower extremities showed no signs of deep vein thrombosis and cardiac ECHO showed ejection fraction of 65%. Abdominal ultrasound showed para-aortic, bilateral pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy.\\nAn excisional biopsy of enlarged axillary and cervical lymph node was performed. The cervical lymph node measured 1.8 x 1 x 0.7 cm and axillary node measured 3.6 x 2.6 x 2 cm. Nodes had firm consistency with no signs of necrosis or haemorrhage. Histological examination of lymph nodes showed effaced architecture, due to infiltration of polymorphic tumour lymphoid cells. The interfollicular area of lymph node was infiltrated with medium to large sized lymphocytes, having blastoid morphology indicative of centroblasts and immunoblasts and intermingled with plasmablast-like cells. Also, there were scattered large bi-nucleated cells similar to Reed-Sternberg cells. In between there were many eosinophils, histiocytes and plasma cells. Furthermore, within interfollicular areas, many mitoses and apoptosis were found. Four-micrometer sections from paraffin-embedded blocks were stained with each antibody listed below, using the streptavidin-biotin complex method. By immunohistochemistry, large atypical lymphoid cells were CD1a-, CD2-, CD3-, CD4-/+, CD5-, CD8-, CD20-, CD79a+, PAX-5-, CD38+, CD138-, CD30-/+, CD56-, MUM1+, PD-1-/+, Bcl-2-, ALK-, c-myc-, TdT-, CD45+, Bcl-6-, CD10- and HHV-8-. The Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridisation was negative (Figure 1). Kappa and lambda light chain in situ hybridisation did not show restriction. CD68 staining showed lot of histiocytes and Ki-67 proliferation index was high, approximately 65% (Figure 1).\\nDue to the unusual morphology, as well as the immunophenotype of large, polymorphic cells, with blast and plasmablast-like appearance (CD20-/PAX-5-/CD79a+/CD38+/MUM-1+/CD4-/+) a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of B-cell and T-cell receptor rearrangement were performed using BIOMED-2 protocol. Briefly, BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR reactions using fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide primers were performed in triplicates with 50 ng and 200 ng of DNA per 50 microL reaction. Following PCR amplification, the PCR products were resolved using capillary electrophoresis on the SeqStudio (Applied Biosystems, USA) genetic analyser. GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, USA) was then used to analyse PCR products by peak height and size determination. The clonality analysis of IgH gene in FR2 and FR3 regions showed polyclonal distribution of PCR products (gaussian distribution of multiple peaks representing multiple PCR products) while the IgKappa gene clonality analysis showed only one prominent peak (monoclonal result consisting of one type of PCR product) (Figure 2). However, the T cell receptor analysis of TCR gamma region showed bi-clonal and TCR beta region monoclonal distribution of PCR products (Figure 3).\\nConsidering histological, immunohistochemical and clonality analysis results our final diagnosis was primary nodal CD20 and PAX-5 negative DLBCL with dual IgK and TCR rearrangement. The whole-body computer tomography (CT) scan showed generalised lymphadenopathy and bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of infiltration. Thus, a stage IIIB of disease was confirmed. Considering, poor prognosis of primary CD20 negative DLBCL, patient was treated with 6 cycles of the R-DA-EPOCH (dose adjusted rituximab, etoposide prednisolone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) chemotherapy protocol. The subsequent follow up laboratory tests as well as positron emission tomography and computed tomography scans (PET-CT) showed no evidence of lymphoproliferative disease 4 years after initial diagnosis. The collateral finding at the last control PET-CT scan was diffuse thickening of the large colon at sigmoid region. A colon surgery was performed, and histological examination showed colon adenocarcinoma (pT2, pN0). Other than that, patient did not have any health-related difficulties.',\n",

The swelling started gradually following the excision of a right axillary lump. The mass was diagnosed as a right axillary CH of about 2cm x 1cm in dimensions. Just before her presentation, the swelling became big enough to disturb her daily activities. She had no family history of breast cancer. There were no other swellings elsewhere in her body. She was not a smoker or alcoholic, and there was no previous surgery or chronic illnesses. Examination revealed a swollen right breast with \"peau d\\' orange\" and erythema around the right nipple-areola complex (NAC). There was asymmetry in the shape of the right breast compared to the left and right breast ptosis. The skin was thickened and red but no hotness or tenderness. No masses were felt in the right breast. The right NAC appeared normal. Apart from the linear scar of the previous CH excision in the right axilla, the axilla was normal. Left breast and axilla examination revealed no obvious or palpable abnormalities (Figure 1). Ultrasound examination of the breast and axilla revealed mild skin thickening. The breast parenchyma was dense and showed an anechoic tubular and round structure. The right breast showed a loculated cystic area with internal septations. It measured 3.4cm x 1.2cm x 5.1cm and multiple smaller cyst (Figure 2A). The mammogram showed marked skin thickening with edema (Figure 2B).  \\nWe attempted needle aspiration away from the cysts, and the fluid was easily aspirated from the edematous breast tissues. The fluid was watery and clear yellowish. The laboratory result of the fluid was lymphatic fluid. Aspiration trials were repeated twice with almost a complete resolution of the edema, but there was a recurrence within two weeks in every aspiration attempt. Subsequently, the patient consented to a shunt catheter placement between the edematous breast and the peritoneal cavity, a relatively new technique for breast edema secondary to CH. There was a partial resolution of the breast edema after the shunt surgery. The patient was followed up for five years. The last ultrasound and mammogram showed recurrence of cysts of the same axilla, and new cysts appeared in the breast (Figure 3A and B).',\n",

He had a history of dry age-related macular degeneration, and FECD. He underwent bilateral phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implants in 1996, and 4 years later was diagnosed with bullous keratopathy. On clinical examination, his best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were OD hand movement and OS 20/200. He had bilateral bullous keratopathy, which was more marked in the right eye. The cornea was edematous with pannus and multiple scars. There was no fundal view but B-scan ultrasonography excluded gross vitreoretinal pathology. The patient was given a guarded prognosis as to the outcome as pre-operative retinal examination was not possible.\\nIn November 2011, he underwent an uncomplicated right PK under general anesthetic using a 7.5 mm donor and recipient punch. A vacuum trephine was used to cut through the cornea in a controlled rotatory manner until the anterior chamber was penetrated, confirmed by evidence of aqueous eruption at the wound site. Scissors were used to separate and remove the button and 10.0 nylon interrupted and continuous sutures were placed. Sub-conjunctival dexamethasone and cefuroxime were administered intra-operatively, along with chirocaine in the sub-Tenon's space. Dexamethasone Minims  0.1% and chloramphenicol Minims  0.5% (Bausch + Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA) were prescribed four times daily for the post-operative period. On day 1 and 2 postoperatively, his BCVA OD was hand movement and postoperative anterior chamber inflammation of 3+ cells was found, based on the standard uveitis classification system. At that stage, his steroid treatment was increased to six times a day, along with a Maxitrol  ointment (dexamethasone, neomycin sulphate, polymyxin B sulphate; Alcon Eye Care UK Ltd, Surrey, UK) at night. Fundal examination revealed atrophic age-related macular degeneration, which was expected to affect his visual outcome.\\nOn the ninth post-operative day, BCVA remained hand movement only in the right eye. A clear gap was apparent between the healthy graft and a thin, transparent sheet of tissue in the anterior chamber. The graft was otherwise clear and this sheet was presumed to be retained DM, as confirmed on histopathology (Figure 1, arrow). Steroid drops were tapered on a monthly basis and his review was arranged for two months with in vivo confocal microscopy testing.\\nAt the next clinical review, the graft had remained clear and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) testing, confirmed the presence of DM and healthy endothelial cell count. This was diagnosed as retention of the host's DM rather than a detachment of the donor's DM (Figure 2) as the latter would have been associated with endothelial loss and corneal decompensation. The patient underwent a further uneventful operation for extraction of the retrocorneal membrane under local anesthetic in April 2012.\\nPost-operative recovery was uneventful and 2 weeks later, a clear healthy graft with an improved BCVA of OD 20/200 was noted, with the limited acuity more likely related to his atrophic macular degeneration rather than the graft. Further clinical reviews have shown that the graft has remained clear and healthy without any signs of rejection.\",\n",

The lymph node findings showed reactive follicles, clusters of epithelioid cells, and patches of monocytoid cells, which is the triad of Toxoplasma lymphadenopathy. Toxoplasma lymphadenitis was suspected.

       "    'case_text': 'An 8-month-old girl was admitted to the pediatric department of our hospital after first presenting at the age of 3 months with abnormal facial features that had been noticed within 4 weeks of birth (Figure 1A). Her parents were healthy first cousins. Her prenatal ultrasound examination showed no obvious abnormalities. Because the age of the mother at the expected delivery date was more than 35 years, chromosome microarray analysis by amniocentesis had been performed. The chromosome microarray analysis showed no chromosome number abnormalities or pathogenic copy number variation, and detected eight loss of heterozygosity regions of unknown significance. The mother refused whole-exome sequencing of amniotic fluid owing to the high cost. The patient was born after a full-term pregnancy with a birth weight of 2860 g and an Apgar score of 9-10-10. She had no significant family history and had a healthy 9-year-old sister.\\nAt the age of 3 months, physical examination revealed a progeroid facial appearance of coarse facial features with prominent cheekbones and a triangular chin, a low frontal and posterior hairline, and facial hirsutism. She also had hepatomegaly (7 cm in the midclavicular line) with no subcutaneous fat, marked hypertrophy of muscles in the limbs, and acanthosis nigricans. A 3/6 systolic murmur was heard in the precardiac region. Echocardiography showed normal ventricular wall thicknesses (Figure 2A). (interventricular septum (IVS) measured as 4.5 mm, Z score +1.62; left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) measured as 4 mm, Z score +0.24) and slightly accelerated blood flow in the right ventricular outflow tract (Figure 2B). The preliminary diagnosis was progeria without further treatment.\\nAt the age of 5 months, the physical examination findings were similar to the findings at 3 months (Figure 1B). Standard conventional echocardiography performed at the age of 5 months showed myocardial hypertrophy (Figure 2C). (IVS measured as 13 mm, Z score +23.21; LVPW measured as 8.5 mm, Z score +9.1) and an obstructive pattern in the left ventricular outflow tract (Figure 2D) but a normal ejection fraction of 70%. Because the ventricular wall thickness was significantly thicker at the age of 5 months than it was at the age of 3 months, we ruled out the diagnosis of classic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and considered that the ventricular wall hypertrophy was caused by metabolic factors. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking (2D-STE) was performed to assess strain parameters in the left ventricle and revealed a global longitudinal strain of -16.79% (Figure 3A), a global radial strain of 65.67%, and a global circumferential strain of -14.04%. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatic steatosis with hepatomegaly. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm and a prolonged QTc interval (Figure 4). Her blood pressure was 123/65 mmHg. Additional fasting blood testing showed an increased free fatty acid concentration (1.39 mmol/L), normoglycemic hyperinsulinemia (glycemia concentration, 4.60 mmol/L; insulin concentration, 58.53 microIU/mL), dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides [10.14 mmol/L], total cholesterol [5.33 mmol/L], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [3.8 mmol/L]), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.69 mmol/L) indicating insulin resistance. CGL was considered based on the physical characteristics and investigations.\\nAt the age of 8 months, 2D-STE showed a decrease in several left ventricular strain parameters (global longitudinal strain, -13.50% (Figure 3B); global radial strain, 37.63%; and global circumferential strain, -14.76%) compared with the values recorded at the age of 5 months despite the findings on conventional echocardiography showing no significant change (IVS measured as 13.5 mm, Z score +23.34; LVPW measured as 8.5 mm, Z score +9.7). Combined with the typical clinical manifestations (severe insulin resistance with lipoatrophy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hirsutism), exon group of single gene disease-customized capture sequencing test at the age of 9 months identified a homozygous mutation in the BSCL2 gene: c.166_184del (p.Tyr56fs*) (reference sequence NM_032667.6) on 11q12.3, confirming a diagnosis of type 2 CGL (OMIM # 269700).. Both her mother and sister were confirmed to be heterozygous carriers. Dietary modification was introduced to restrict her fat intake to 25% of the total dietary energy. Follow-up biochemistry at the age of 14 months showed progressive improvement in the fasting lipid profile (triglycerides, 4.13 mmol/L; total cholesterol, 5.10 mmol/L; insulin concentration, 29.49 microIU/mL) with normal glycemia concentration [4.5 mmol/L]. Her blood pressure at the age of 14 months was normal. Conventional echocardiography showed no significant changes (IVS measured as 13 mm, Z score +20.55; LVPW measured as 8.5 mm, Z score +7.75) from the findings at the age of 8 months, and the left ventricular strain parameters measured by 2D-STE tended to remain stable (global longitudinal strain, -13.38% (Figure 3C); global radial strain, 34.60%; global circumferential strain, -14.41%).',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The present study is a clinical case, associated with the research project approved by the Ethics Committee of the Bauru School of Dentistry - University of Sao Paulo, reference number 2235918-CAAE: 71680017.0.0000.5417. The female client was duly informed of the aims and procedures to be adopted in the study and signed the Free and Informed Consent.\\nThe client decided to participate in the study due to wanting to undergo a non-invasive treatment to reduce facial wrinkles, having met the following exclusion criteria: realization of invasive facial procedures (plastic surgery, facial filler, botulinum toxin application, laser application) and non-invasive (drainage; massages; medication; new creams, different to those routinely used) in the year prior to the treatments and during participation in the research, a history of skeletal dentofacial deformity, absence of temporomandibular dysfunction, presence of snoring, absence of more than one dental element.\\nA speech therapy evaluation was performed before and after the therapeutic intervention. The same physical space, equipment, patient position and room lighting were used to collect the images, as recommended by Frazao and Manzi. The aesthetic and orofacial myofunctional aspects were analyzed using photographic documentation and in video, by two previously trained speech therapists, specialists in orofacial motricity, applying the Orofacial Myofunctional Evaluation Protocol MBGR and the validated scales described in the literature. Following the initial evaluation, we performed nine sessions undertaking electromyographic biofeedback training associated with chewing, swallowing and mild smiling without labial sealing. During this period, isometric and isotonic exercises were also realized in therapy, to condition the cheek, tongue and suprahyoid muscles (3 series of 20 seconds, using the Facial Plus and Lingual-Pro-FonoR exercisers), the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle (3 series of 5 seconds, asking the client to open her eyes wide and hold them open, holding the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle firmly) and a speaking exercise with a wine cork between the teeth (opening held at the diameter of the cork - requesting the production of three phrases), as a technique for pronunciation (\"speaking with cork\"). The client was asked to carry out these exercises daily at home (eye exercises, twice a day, facial and lingual exercisers and \"speaking with cork\", once a day), as well as using a TransporeTM inelastic bandage once a day while sleeping at night, over the frontal portion of the right and left occipitofrontal muscle, of the right and left eyebrow corrugator muscle and over the inferior orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle (external corner of the eyes - right and left) and during the day, a small strip of latex (2cm long and 5mm in diameter) in the oral vestibule (intersection between the mentalis muscle and the lower lip) except at meals and while sleeping.\\nDuring the electromyographic feedback training we used the Biotrainer software on the New Miotec Miotool Face USB NM600FO device. It has eight channels connected to differential active sensors, with 16bit resolution, a 2Khz sampling frequency, 20Hz low pass filter, 500Hz high pass filter, 60Hz notch, a clamp connection, and a reference electrode (ground). To capture the electric signal, we used the same device with Double Trace LH-ED4020 differential passive dual electrodes, with dimensions 44 mm long, 21 mm wide, and 20 mm from center to center, placed over the muscles engaged when chewing, swallowing, and smiling (right and left masseter muscles; major, minor zygomatic region, risorius muscles; orbicularis oris (upper lip); suprahyoids; inferior orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle). The reference electrode (ground) was positioned over the styloid process of the ulna of the right arm. The facial areas and regions where we positioned the electrodes were sterilized with cotton wool soaked in alcohol 77% GL (70% INPM) prior to placing the electrodes for all sessions when electromyographic biofeedback was employed.\\nIn the initial evaluation, no alterations to chewing function were observed (a score of zero out of 10, for the MGBR Protocol). For swallowing, a marked contraction of the orbicularis oris and mentalis muscles, during routine swallowing of chewed, solid food and guided swallowing of liquid was observed (score 8 out of 28). The analysis of signs of facial aging showed an absence of static perioral wrinkles (score zero), moderate dynamic perioral wrinkles (score two out of four), moderate nasolabial grooves (score two out of four) and mild labiomentonian grooves (score one out of four). The smile evaluation score obtained using video image capture of the dynamic periorbital wrinkles, in the third execution of the \"open smile\" and of the photographic image of the static periorbital wrinkles in diagonal position (45o), showed accentuated dynamic periorbital wrinkles (score of three out of four) and moderate static periorbital wrinkles (score of two out of four).\\nFor training with electromyographic biofeedback, the electrodes were placed in a sequence favoring progressive control by the client of the movements of the different muscle groups when executing trained orofacial functions. As such, to train alternating unilateral chewing in the second session, the electrodes were positioned parallel to the direction of the muscle fiber, over the right and left masseter muscles. For the third and fourth sessions, the electrodes were placed over these muscles as well as over the orbicularis oris muscle (upper lip). This position was maintained for the fifth to the ninth sessions, to train alternating bilateral chewing. To train the swallowing function, initiated in the third session with swallowing pasty food (Greek yogurt), the electrodes were initially placed over the suprahyoid muscle region; in the fourth and fifth sessions electrodes were placed over the orbicularis oris muscle (upper lip); these electrodes were maintained to train liquid swallowing in the fifth session, and chewed solid food in the sixth session, when an electrode over the right and left masseter muscles was added and kept until the ninth session. Figure 1B shows the position of the electrodes for training of chewing and swallowing functions. For smile training initiated in the fifth session, an electrode was placed over the region of the risorius muscle and, for the sixth to the ninth sessions, an electrode on the lower orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle was added. Despite placing the electrodes in the risorius region, the possibility of capturing an electric signal from the adjacent muscles cannot be overlooked (cross talk). Even so, during training it was possible to compare the contraction of the risorius region muscles and the inferior orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle. As such, the client managed to reduce the muscle contractions in the eye region while smiling, with consequent reduction of static and dynamic periorbital wrinkles.',\n",

Other baseline investigations revealed a small atrial septal defect on echocardiography, mild to moderate hearing loss on audiology, normal vision and retinas on ophthalmological evaluation, raised bilirubin and liver enzymes (alanine and aspartate transaminases) and positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM with a negative CMV PCR. He was HIV-unexposed and his HIV ELISA was negative, but CD4% was low (19%). Culture of the gastric aspirate eventually was positive, confirming M. tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin on line-probe assay as well as resistant to second-line injectable agents with second-line LPA, but susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. He was therefore confirmed as pre-XDR-TB. The mother's sputum was X-pert MTB/RIF negative. The chest x-ray showed active tuberculosis with infiltrates at the right upper-middle lung field with an increased of bronchovascular marking (Fig. 1). We treated him with five kind of less hepatotoxic anti tuberculosis drugs by individualized treatment based on the updated WHO 2018 guidelines.

       "    'case_text': 'A 14-year-old male patient presented to our rheumatology clinic with a 4-month history of left hip pain. The pain was more severe in the morning and sometimes woke him up at night and also increased with practicing sports (hockey and lacrosse). His pain is 1-2 of 10 when he is resting and 7-8 of 10 when he is playing sports. There was no history of trauma. There was no associated swelling or morning stiffness, and no pain in any other joints.\\nThe patient was initially evaluated in the orthopedics clinic. Initial blood work revealed normal complete blood picture (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Left hip X-ray was normal. Initial MR arthrogram of the left hip showed marked edema of the medial and posterior walls of the left acetabulum (Figure 1). The patient was started on naproxen 220 mg (3.5 mg/kg) once daily, with limited improvement in terms of less frequent waking up at night from pain, knowing this is not optimal dose.\\nWith persistence of pain, CT-guided biopsy of the left acetabulum was performed and revealed unremarkable flow cytometry, and histopathology showed cortical bone with rare foci of marrow elements and a mild chronic inflammatory component and no evidence of malignancy. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic for further evaluation. Initial examination showed pain with flexion and external rotation with mild limitation of full external rotation of the left hip. JIA and CRMO could not be ruled out given his clinical examination and the histopathology result. The patient was started on prednisone 50 mg (0.7 mg/kg) once daily (that was gradually tapered), and naproxen dose was increased to 375 mg twice daily. Two months later, left hip pain continued, and he started to experience pain of the right hip, right metacarpophalangeal (MCPs), and left clavicle. He was started on weekly methotrexate in addition for presumed diagnosis of JIA and/or CRMO. Bone scan was unremarkable apart from focal increased uptake in the left acetabulum (Figure 2).\\nAfter two months of methotrexate treatment, the patient reported improvement in the intensity and frequency of the left hip pain; however, he was still experiencing pain with certain positions. The pain of the right hip, left clavicle, and right MCPs resolved completely. Due to persistence of the left hip pain, adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous every 2 weeks was added, with no significant improvement in pain. He reported increased need for NSAIDs (twice daily almost every day). Repeat contrast-enhanced MRI showed left hip effusion that decreased from before, with medial focal synovial enhancement and edema of the acetabulum (Figure 3). These findings are not typical for JIA where more diffuse synovial process would be anticipated. Pain was refractory to treatment for presumed JIA and CRMO with NSAIDs, steroids, methotrexate, and adalimumab. Subsequently, CT scan of the left hip was done for further evaluation. It showed 11 x 6 mm low attenuation focus with subtle internal nidus in the posteromedial aspect of the acetabular rim suggestive of intra-articular OO (Figure 4). Steroids, adalimumab, and methotrexate were discontinued. Uncomplicated radiofrequency ablation of the left acetabular OO was performed with complete resolution of the left hip pain.',\n",

The animal was a castrated 3.5-year-old wild born male cheetah, living since the age of 3 months in a large fenced area surrounding the farmhouse. He had been vaccinated yearly against rabies (Rabisin ), feline calicivirus, feline panleukemia virus, feline viral rhinotracheitis virus (Feligen CRP , Virbac), and feline leukemia virus (Tricat, Nobivac). The surgical option was made. A fine needle aspirate of the mass was not attempted before surgery, as this would have required an additional anesthesia. During the clinical investigation, the cheetah was found in a good health status with a body weight of 47 kg.\\nThe cheetah was immobilized with a mixture of ketamine (3.2 mg/kg, Ketavet , Kyron Laboratories, Benrose, RSA) and medetomidine (0.06 mg/kg, Novartis, Spartan, Republic of South Africa) administered with a dart shot from a dartgun (Telinject, Dudenhofen, Germany). The skin around the mass was shaved and the surgical field was washed and disinfected with 70% ethanol. The mass and covering skin were excised from the adjacent tissue. The neoplasia was well encapsulated and no infiltrative growth into the surrounding tissue was visible, but it had one large supportive blood vessel, which was ligated and cut. The wound was closed with a subcutaneous consecutive suture and several cutaneous suture stiches both with absorbable material. The animal was treated prophylactically with 2 mg/kg ketoprofen (Ketofen , Merial) as anti-inflammatory and pain medication and with a combination of 15.000 IU/kg procaine benzyl penicillin and 15.000 IU/kg benzathine benzyl penicillin (Peni-LA Phenix , Virbac) to prevent a wound infection. To keep the wound clean from dust and dirt, we dressed the animal with children's shirt, which was removed by the farmer seven days after surgery. The immobilization was reversed with Atipamezole (0.11 mg/kg, Antisedan , Pfizer, RSA). The wound remained uninfected and was nearly invisible at the annual medical check-up one year after the surgery and the cheetah was still alive 3.5 years after removal of the tumor without any signs of recurrence.\\nThe excised neoplasia was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and shipped to Germany in full compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) for histological examination at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin.\\nThe tumor presented itself as an exophytic firm encapsulated broad based nodular dermal to subcutaneous mass measuring 5.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 2.5 cm, covered by intact sparsely haired dark pigmented skin. Cut surfaces revealed multiple small lobules separated by fine white strands of connective tissue (Figure 2). Lobules were mottled light to dark grey or whitish with multinodular solid growth pattern and they did not exceed the surgical excision margins. Microscopically, some lobules were populated by high numbers of heavily dark brown, pigmented cells, while others contained lightly pigmented cells, which were mostly distributed in the periphery of each lobule (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Within the lobules, cells were oriented in cords and trabeculae or small islands separated by thin collagen, while distinct sheets of collagen-rich connective tissue surrounded the entire lobules (Figure 3(c)). Rarely, small assemblies of dark pigmented cells (melanophages) were found in the separating connective tissue septa. The neoplastic cells were cuboidal to polygonal with uniformly large round to ovoid central nuclei with stippled chromatin and 1-2 nucleoli (Figure 3(d)). Cytoplasm was scant to moderate, pale eosinophilic, sparsely stained and finely granular. The majority of the tumor cells had indistinct cell borders (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). Occasionally, single mitotic figures were found (one per 10 high power fields). The overlying epidermis was made of five to six even layers of unremarkable keratinocytes containing some melanosomes in the basal cells as well as some cells of the stratum germinativum. There was mild orthokeratosis and a few remaining hair follicles. The superficial dermis contained mild nodular perivascular neutrophilic infiltrates and dermal collagen was markedly thickened as a response to the expanding tumor, but no other pathological changes were apparent.\\nA panel of immunohistochemistry stains was applied and revealed tumor cells being positive for pancytokeratin but negative for MelanA, S100, and vimentin. Although the dark pigmentation and nests and islands of polygonal cells prompted the differential diagnosis of a melanocytoma, the immunohistochemistry results lead to the final diagnosis of a moderately pigmented basal cell tumor.\",\n",

She was referred from a clinic in a small district located around 31 km from the nearest tertiary hospital. She had history of a flame burn at the age of 5 years old to her chest, abdomen, upper limb and part of her trunk. She was admitted for about 4 months in the Burn Unit in a tertiary hospital where skin grafts were done in 3 stages on her whole chest and abdomen. Despite the injuries, she noticed pubertal breasts development. During this pregnancy, she had further breast development which increased in size and her abdomen was able to stretch to accommodate her pregnancy. Physical examination showed a pregnancy which corresponded to her date. The skin over her chest and abdomen appeared tight with areas of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation due to scarring from the skin graft. There were normal breasts swelling and breast tissues palpable over her chest with the absence of areola and nipple. Sensations over the skin grafted area were intact. The breasts and abdomen (antenatally) are shown in Fig. 1 (Antenatal: Right breast), Fig. 2 (Antenatal: Left breast) and Fig. 3 (Antenatal: Breasts and abdomen).\\nA counselling session was conducted to explore her expectations and hopes regarding her ability to breastfeed her baby. Further counselling was done to prepare her that she might not be able to breastfeed her child due to her physical condition and may need lactation suppression post-birth. Alternative methods of feeding were discussed.\\nShe birthed her infant at 36 weeks and 5 days via spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. Oral cabergoline 1 mg was given on the first postpartum day to suppress lactation. The baby was given infant formula via bottle feeding as the feeding method of choice. On subsequent days, she noticed her breasts reduced in size.\\nAt day 6 postpartum, her breasts reduced in size almost to the pre-pregnancy stage as shown in Fig. 4 (Postnatal Day 6: Breasts).\\nA breast ultrasound was done at day 6 postpartum. It showed dilated lactiferous ducts at retroareolar region bilaterally, consistent with lactating ducts of the breasts. The normally appearing vague shadow of the nipple was not seen. However, the tightly packed ducts seen parallel to the ultrasound beam are suggestive of major ducts to the possible location of the nipple as shown in Fig. 5 (Ultrasound: Right breast) and Fig. 6 (Ultrasound: Left breast).\\nA discussion with the plastic surgeon was made regarding the possibility of surgery to enable her to breastfeed in her future pregnancies. However, patient was not keen for any surgeries as she was made aware of the risks and complications. She also felt contented with her decision to bottle feed her child with infant formula.\\nScheduled home postnatal visits were done to ensure that mother and baby were coping well.

       "    'case_text': 'A forty-nine-year-old female from a suburban community in Sri Lanka presented with insidious high grade intermittent fever with chills and rigors for 2 months. She experienced one to two febrile episodes daily with complete defervescence in between. She also had anorexia, weight loss, sore-throat and symmetrical large joint arthritis without morning stiffness. Small joints and axial skeleton were spared. She also noticed an itchy desquamating erythematous rash over back of the trunk and proximal limbs. Erythematous patches were transient and recurring but did not temporally correspond to febrile peaks. The patient did not have any symptoms referable to a focus of infection and did not report photosensitivity, Raynaud phenomenon, past history of tuberculosis, or high risk sexual behaviours.\\nThe patient was averagely built (BMI: 23.1 kg/m2), febrile (39.9  C), ill and pale. A firm 1.5 cm lymph node in the right posterior cervical group was noted. Throat was non-inflamed. Erythematous macules noted over the trunk and proximal limbs were transient. Symmetric arthritis affected elbow, wrist and knee joints. A smooth non-tender 2 cm hepatomegaly was noted. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.\\nInvestigations revealed a normocytic normochromic anaemia, neutrophil leukocytosis with toxic changes, reactive thrombocytosis, elevated ESR (110 mm 1st hour), CRP (165 U/L) and ferritin (3200 U/L). Renal function was normal and liver enzymes were mildly elevated (AST 66 U/L, ALT 57 U/L). Auto antibody panel, including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), dsDNA antibodies, pANCA and cANCA were negative. Contrast enhanced computerized tomography of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated enlarged cervical lymph nodes and fatty liver. Radiographs of large joints were normal. Biopsy of the lymph node showed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with no evidence of neoplastic changes, suppuration or granuloma. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine showed no abnormalities. Blood and bone marrow cultures for bacteria, tuberculosis, brucellosis, melioidosis and fungi were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed polyclonal gamma-globulinaemia and reduced albumin fraction. As she had been exposed to flood water 2 weeks prior to symptom onset (compatible with incubation period of 1-3 weeks) and several cases of melioidosis had been reported in her residential area, antibodies against Burkholderia pseudomallei were tested. It turned positive (1:640, indirect haemagglutination) and titre continued to rise over time (Fig. 1).\\nFebrile illness, possible exposure to infectious agents during floods and elevated inflammatory markers necessitated consideration of empiric antibiotic therapy. The patient was treated with ceftazidime (2 g 6 hourly IV) and imipenem (1 g 8 hourly IV) for 14 days and ceftazidime and cotrimoxazole (1440 mg bid orally) for another 14 days, due to positive serology for melioidosis. However she did not show clinical improvement. Fever persisted and inflammatory markers remained elevated. Serum ferritin and melioidosis antibody titre continued to rise exponentially. However repeated peripheral blood cultures for melioidosis did not isolate any bacteria and repeated imaging did not reveal a focus of infection.\\nDespite a month of broad spectrum antibiotics she remained febrile with persistently elevated inflammatory markers. In retrospect, AOSD was considered as a possible diagnosis. She showed partial response to NSAIDs, further favouring this diagnosis. Subsequently, she was commenced on high dose steroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day). Within 2 days she achieved complete defervescence and made a good clinical recovery. Serum ferritin level and melioidosis antibody titre declined over time (Fig. 1). After one month of steroid therapy she remained afebrile, but had mild residual large joint arthritis with minimal functional impairment. Methotrexate was commenced and steroids were tapered over next 2 months and at 6 months she remained asymptomatic on methotrexate with normal inflammatory markers. Long term follow up was arranged.\\nThe final diagnosis of AOSD was made based on clinical features and exclusion of other connective tissue disorders, neoplasms and infections. During the course of her illness the patient did not develop Macrophage Activation Syndrome, a serious complication of AOSD.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 56-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our hospital emergency room in September 2020 with repeat fatigue, abdominal distension, and melena for 1 month. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) suggested obviously uneven thickening and strengthening of the gastric body and gastric antrum wall, possibly accompanied by ulcers and multiple lymph nodes adjacent to the stomach enlarged. Gastroscopic examination revealed a giant ulcerative lesion located in the posterior wall of the gastric antrum, with the invasion of stomach angle and pylorus. Subsequent pathological examination of the biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. On September 19, 2020, she underwent radical gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer and D2 lymphadenectomy. Pathohistological results of distal gastric cancer resection showed that the tumor was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stroma component ( Figure 1 ), without any cancer in the surgical margin and metastasis to regional lymph nodes. An EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) assay demonstrated strong positive staining parallel to the tumor harboring EBV infection ( Figure 1 ). Meanwhile, the immunohistochemistry indicated that MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 were overexpressed (pMMR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was not amplified. The tumor was confirmed as pT4bN0M0 poorly gastric antrum differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stroma component (EBER-ISH+ and HER2-). The outcomes of next-generation sequencing (NGS) verified fifteen gene mutations ( Table 1 ), a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) with 10.8 Muts/Mb, and microsatellite stable (MSS) status. Immunohistochemical (IHC) data of the tumor tissue suggested that the positive expression of PD-L1 protein and the tumor proportion score (TPS) was 70% and the combined positive score (CPS) was 75 ( Figure 1 ). The immune microenvironment was examined by multiplex immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis ( Figure 1  and  Table 2 ). Two months after the operation, abdominal CT showed enlargement of mass located in the gastrocolic ligament ( Figure 2 ), which indicated metastatic lymph node (LN). Oxaliplatin 200 mg on day 1 plus oral S-1 60 mg twice a day, from days 1 to 14, along with camrelizumab 200 mg on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks, was administered as first-line treatment. Then, radiographic evaluation was performed every 8 weeks by enhanced CT. The significant resolution of the lymph node was observed after two cycles' exposure of regimen SOX combined with camrelizumab, and the best efficacy evaluation was PR based on RECIST 1.1. Early tumor shrinkage was observed after 8 weeks, and persistent shrinkage of LN was achieved after 4 cycles ( Figure 2 ). From then on, she had been exposed to SOX combined with camrelizumab up to 8 months and still achieved continuous PR. Moreover, the quality of life of the patient was good. Chemotherapy-associated AEs (grade 1 nausea, vomit and grade 2 anemia, grade 2 decreased neutrophil count, and decreased white blood cell count) were observed, and grade 1 reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP) was presented without any other immune-related adverse event. After 7 cycles' SOX plus camrelizumab, the lesion was still unresectable due to whole abdominal adhesions. After multidisciplinary team (MDT) consultation, the patient underwent external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and received 50 Gy/25 fractions. She received S-1 and camrelizumab as the maintenance therapy up to 10 cycles followed by EBRT. Tumor is gradually and continuously shrinking in the latest visit and in deep response with a >80% decrease in size ( Figure 2 ). Until now, PFS reached at least 12 months and the duration of response was beyond 10 months with manageable toxicity.\",\n",

Early phase fundus angiography showed early filling of the vessel, confirming its arterial origin (data not shown). Near infrared reflectance (NIR) showed a subtle hyperreflective serpentine-shaped structure temporal to the fovea (Figure 2, left panels). EDI-OCT revealed a thickened choroid and an enlarged vascular structure that spanned the entire thickness of the choroid, from the choriocapillaris to the choroid-scleral junction (Figure 2). Near the fovea, there was an abnormal ellipsoid zone (EZ), including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hyperreflectivity, and focal EZ compression with reduced outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness, as well as an indented choroidal-scleral junction (CSJ, Figure 2). Transverse EDI-OCT sections of the choroidal macrovessel demonstrated its narrowing as it coursed temporally through the macula (Figure 2).

The tumor was positive for EGFR mutation, KRAS wild type, ALK negative, CK7 positive, CK20 negative, and TTF negative. At that time, no chemotherapy or radiation was required. In 2014, the patient had a recurrence of her disease with a metastasis to mediastinal subcarinal lymph node. Over the next four years due to disease progression or inability to tolerate agents (e.g., development of acute pancreatitis from erlotinib), the patient was treated with multiple antineoplastic agents including bevacizumab, pemetrexed, durvalumab, tremelimumab, erlotinib, and afatinib. These were all discontinued over 6 months prior to this admission to the hospital. She also received palliative radiation to the right mediastinal mass as well as to several metastatic spine lesions in the cervical and thoracic spine during 2017. Follow-up staging imaging did not show any evidence of radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis. In early 2018, she underwent biopsy of metastatic liver lesions, found to be adenocarcinoma of the lung primary with EGFR exon 19 deletion and T790M mutations. In April 2018, she was started on Osimertinib 80 mg daily, which she tolerated well for approximately four months. A staging CT was completed in June of 2018, which showed response to therapy as evidenced by a decrease in size of the right infrahilar mass, adenopathy, pulmonary nodules, and hepatic metastases. In addition, her previously noted brain metastasis was no longer seen on her brain MRI. In August 2018, she required an admission to an outside facility due to symptoms suggestive of congestive heart failure. She was diuresed and diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Her heart failure remained well compensated on goal-directed medical therapy and diuretics. Other past medical history is notable for hypertension, acid reflux, emphysema, and iron deficiency anemia. She is not prescribed any antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents. She has several allergies to antibiotics and was previously intolerant to subcutaneous heparin.\\nThe patient was admitted to our facility in September 2018 due to progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and weakness of several weeks of duration. She was initially managed as hospital-acquired pneumonia in an immunocompromised host with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, aggressive bronchodilators, and intravenous corticosteroids. Within 24 hours of admission, transfer to the intensive care unit was facilitated due to worsening respiratory distress requiring noninvasive positive pressure ventilation which eventually progressed to require mechanical ventilation. At this time, her exam was remarkable for predominant left-sided rhonchi and rales. Laboratory analysis was unremarkable except a severe acute respiratory acidosis of pH 7.18 and PCO2 of 54 mmHg. Upon arrival, her WBC count was 7.6 x 103/muL, hemoglobin was 8.5 g/dL, and platelets were 305 x 103/muL, and she had normal coagulation panel and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). A CT chest with contrast demonstrated a consolidation in the left lung suspicious for pneumonia and small effusions bilaterally with associated atelectasis (Figure 1). Her antibiotics were continued.\\nDue to the progressive respiratory failure, a bronchoscopy was performed. The bronchoscopy revealed inflamed airways (left>right) and increasingly hemorrhagic return on sequential lavages (Figure 2) from the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) RBC counts were increasing significantly in sequential samples (42,000/muL, 190,000/muL, and 230,000/muL). She was diagnosed with DAH with predominant left-sided parenchymal involvement. She was initiated with pulse dose methylprednisone 250 mg IV every 6 hours for 3 days. Her ventilator settings improved significantly after the initiation of pulse dose systemic steroids. After three days of IV steroids, we decided to repeat the bronchoscopy due to continued small amount of blood-tinged tracheal aspirates requiring in-line suction. On repeat bronchoscopy, the airway inflammation had diminished considerably. There was no visible bleeding. We elected to repeat a sequential lavage in the lingular segment, which was dramatically less hemorrhagic (Figure 3). The RBC counts from the sequential lavage were 5,250/muL, 6,750/muL, and 11,500/muL. Microbiology from BAL was unremarkable. The patient was transitioned to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg daily. She was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and eventually discharged from the hospital without a need of any supplemental oxygen.\\nA comprehensive standard etiological assessment for DAH was unremarkable including ANCA vasculitis panel and anti-GBM antibodies. Despite her diagnosis of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the patient was not clinically in decompensated heart failure at any point in her admission. Upon medication review, Osimertinib 80 mg daily was the only new medication the patient had initiated in the prior four months. Osimertinib was discontinued in consultation with medical oncology and was held at her discharge from the hospital. She was discharged on a prolonged prednisone taper. A follow-up CT of the chest demonstrated resolution of the opacities in the left upper lobe (Figure 4).',\n",

Similar lesions gradually developed over other sites such as left knee, both elbows, and ears. Other symptoms, such as joint pain, swelling of joints, or fever, were absent. The patient consulted a local doctor who advised a biopsy of the lesions. This biopsy report was suggestive of fungal infection; hence, the patient was treated with itraconazole and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid but without any relief. No acid-fast Bacilli (AFB) staining was done.\\nOn clinical examination, multiple erythematous nodules and plaques of varying sizes ranging from 3 mm to 3 cm in diameter were seen on bilateral ear pinna and bony prominences of the extremities, i.e., elbows, knees, malleoli, and dorsal aspect of bilateral feet [Figure 1].

Microscopy as well as culture for both was negative. Slit skin smear received for detection of Mycobacterium leprae was stained by modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining using 5% sulfuric acid. Examination of stained smear revealed characteristic AFB in large numbers [Figure 2]. A bacterial index of 4+ (10 AFB per oil immersion field) was recorded. Histopathological examination of skin biopsy showed an unremarkable epidermis with underlying dermis showing a diffuse polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate coexisting with foamy histiocytes, neutrophils, plasma cells, and lymphocytes, extending from dermis to subcutis [Figure 3]. AFB were highlighted by Fite-Faraco stain [Figure 4]. Standard nerve stimulation test was done which showed evidence of mild axonal sensory mononeuritis multiplex in bilateral upper limbs and axonal sensory polyneuropathy affecting bilateral lower limbs with bilateral greater auricular, ulnar, common peroneal nerves showing thickening.

Ascites and chronic occlusion of the portal vein (PV) were diagnosed on CT of the abdomen and the patient was referred for TIPS combined with PV recanalization.\\nFollowing informed consent and initiation of general anesthesia, a 4 F Cobra catheter (Cordis, Johnson&Johnson, Miami Lake, FL, USA) was placed through the left transjugular access and wedged with a tip in the branch of the right hepatic vein. CO2 injection showed partly patent but very small intrahepatic PV branches and occlusion of the main PV to the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein. Following replacement of the catheter with a 10-F introducer sheath, several unsuccessful attempts of transjugular transhepatic puncture of the intrahepatic PV branches were carried out using a Rosch-Uchida transjugular liver access set (Cook Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA).\\nIn order to facilitate transjugular, transhepatic access to PV, a trans-splenic puncture of the splenic vein branch was performed using a 22-G needle, and a 5-F introducer sheath was placed. Subsequently, a 4-F Cobra catheter jointly with a 0.035-inch glidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was manipulated through the splenic vein and into the occluded part of PV in the liver. That catheter was exchanged over the wire for a 6x20-mm dilation balloon (Powerflex Pro, Cordis), and then via the transjugular access, a transhepatic puncture towards the balloon was performed from the right hepatic vein using the transjugular access set. With the use of that access, the tip of the glidewire was advanced into the balloon, and then by pulling back the balloon, the glidewire was advanced to the splenic vein. Following dilation of the tract with a 4x40-mm balloon (Powerflex Pro), a 10-F transjugular sheath was advanced through the transhepatic tract and the recanalized segment of PV. Two Viatorrs (8x80+20 mm and 8x60+20 mm) were deployed coaxially, connecting the SMV/splenic vein confluence with the right hepatic vein. Contrast-enhanced examination showed a short stenosis at the cranial end of the created shunt and repeated balloon dilation was attempted. The 8 x40-mm balloon (Powerflex Pro) inflated partly into the Viatorr was accidentally moved in the cranial direction, causing dislodgement of the cranial part of the endoprosthesis to the right atrium.\\nAfter replacing the previous sheath with an 18-F sheath (Cook Inc.), a GooseNeck Snare (EV3, Plymouth, MN, USA) with a 15-mm loop was introduced over the guide wire. The loop of the snare was placed over the cranial edge of the Viatorr (Figure 1). The Viatorr was squeezed and the sheath was advanced over the endoprosthesis. The Viatorr was withdrawn into the sheath and was removed together with the sheath. However, during that withdrawal, the second (coaxially placed in the first one) Viatorr followed into IVC and the removal procedure was repeated as described above (Figure 2). Thereafter, two new Viatorr endoprostheses (8x80+20 mm) were placed in an adequate position, with subsequent good function of the TIPS.

That was misinterpreted by the physician performing the procedure, who placed a Viatorr connecting the bile duct to the right hepatic vein. The physician reported later that \"the flow from the SMV was good, the gradient was=0 mmHg, and the TIPS was created successfully\".\\nOn the following three days the patient\\'s condition deteriorated and on the fourth day he showed signs of general sepsis and abdominal distension requiring urgent ICU care. The inflammatory parameters were high and the laboratory tests were critically elevated (P-bilirubin=466 mumol/L; CRP=43mg/L; P-creatinine=435 mumol/L). At that time the error was identified and a percutaneous biliary drainage catheter was placed percutaneously through the right liver lobe bile ducts to the duodenum.\\nAfterwards, the patient was transferred to the Department of Hepatic Surgery at our hospital, for urgent treatment. Following an interdisciplinary decision and discussion with the patient and his family, it was undertaken to attempt removal of the Viatorr. With the patient under general anesthesia, a paraumbilical vein was punctured using ultrasonographic guidance, and a 4-F Cobra catheter was advanced to the right portal vein branch. CO2 portography through that catheter showed a hepatofugal flow in the portal vein but no connection with the bile duct (Figure 4). The percutaneous biliary drainage catheter was removed over the guidewire and replaced with a 8-F sheath. Through the left jugular vein, a 4-F Cobra catheter was introduced jointly with a 0.035-inch glide-wire through the Viatorr to the common bile duct. After confirmation of their position, the sheath was exchanged over the 0.035-inch Amplatz wire for a 45-cm-long 16-F sheath. The loop of the 15-mm GooseNeck Snare was placed over the wire. Subsequently, a 10x40-mm dilation balloon was advanced into the Viatorr in order to facilitate placement of the snare over the cranial edge of the Viatorr. However, only a part of the cranial portion of the Viatorr could be grasped with the snare.\\nThe balloon was deflated and attempt to withdraw the Viatorr into the sheath was performed. About 50% of the Viatorr could be retrieved into the sheath, but then the Viatorr become partly disintegrated and could not be further retracted in the sheath. However, the entire Viatorr could be pulled back from the transhepatic tract to the right atrium (Figure 5).\\nThe Amplatz wire tip was withdrawn from the bile duct and advanced to the inferior caval vein (IVC). The right common femoral vein was accessed and another 45-cm-long 16-F sheath was placed with the tip in the IVC. The Amplatz wire was grasped with a 15-mm snare and withdrawn through that sheath. The snare was then advanced over the caudal edge of the Viatorr, which was squeezed and the entire endoprosthesis was pulled back into the sheath in the IVC.\\nThe sheath with the endoprosthesis was removed (Figure 6) and hemostasis was obtained with manual compression. A puncture of the portal vein was performed from the transjugular approach towards the tip of the catheter inserted through the paraumbilical vein (PV). The 10x2+8-mm Viatorr was placed in the tract and dilated with a 10x40-mm balloon. CO2 portography confirmed good flow through the TIPS channel and no flow to the bile duct.\\nThe sheath in the right lobe bile duct was replaced with an 8-F biliary drainage catheter.

This was a new finding compared with a CT scan performed one year priorly. The patient denied any history of abdominal trauma or anticoagulation. She was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where she was comanaged by Maternal Fetal Medicine and General Surgery. She was monitored with serial hemoglobin assessments and abdominal examinations and remained clinically and hemodynamically stable. She was discharged home at 37 weeks of gestation after a 4-day hospitalization and returned for induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation due to chronic hypertension and gestational diabetes. The patient had an uncomplicated, spontaneous vaginal delivery of a female neonate weighing 7 pounds and 4 ounces with APGARs of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. Her postpartum course was uncomplicated and interval imaging study to assess resolution of the adrenal hemorrhage was planned.',\n",

The patient also reported regular, painful contractions. She had a past medical history significant for nephrolithiasis during her previous pregnancy, bipolar disease, and migraines. Prior surgeries included a diagnostic laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain, Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure, and 2 elective terminations of pregnancy. The patient was a 5-6-cigarette/day smoker. On admission vital signs were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed her abdomen to be soft and minimally tender to palpation. A complete blood count was within normal limits with a hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL. A urine drug screen was negative and a urinalysis revealed no blood or evidence of infection. Fetal status was reassuring and an obstetric ultrasound revealed no apparent pathology. The patient's pain improved with intravenous narcotics, antacids, and a muscle relaxer and was attributed to a likely musculoskeletal etiology. However, the patient was found to be in spontaneous labor and progressed to deliver a male infant without complication. Intrapartum pain relief was provided via epidural. On the first postpartum day the patient again complained of left sided flank and upper abdominal pain and was presumptively treated for nephrolithiasis, given the clinical presentation and history, with intravenous narcotics and hydration. Despite treatment, the pain worsened and was associated with nausea and two episodes of emesis. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed enlargement and mild heterogeneity of the left adrenal gland with surrounding fat stranding consistent with acute left adrenal hemorrhage. An MRI performed at the request of the attending physician confirmed these findings as seen in Figure 2. She denied any trauma or use of anticoagulants. Total cortisol level was normal at 14.7 ug/dL with a low ACTH of 5.0 pg/mL. The patient was monitored with serial assessments of hemoglobin and remained clinically and hemodynamically stable. Her pain was controlled with intravenous narcotics. She was discharged on postpartum day 4 with a plan for short interval follow-up. A CT scan performed 8 months later revealed unremarkable adrenal glands with complete resolution of the previously identified hemorrhage.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"An 88-year-old female with insidious onset of dyspnea on exertion and occasional nonproductive cough was found to have a 5.7 cm right hilar mass on chest x-ray. A CT-guided biopsy of the soft tissue mass showed a diffuse, monotonous infiltrate of small to medium-sized lymphocytes. Mitotic figures were not significantly increased, with only approximately 5% of the tumor cell nuclei exhibiting Ki-67 reactivity. The predominant lymphocytes were positive for CD20, CD10, and Bcl-6 and negative for CD3 and Cyclin D1 markers. \\nBone marrow biopsy was performed to assess systemic involvement. The core biopsy revealed a normocellular marrow for age with a single, paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate (Figure 1), demonstrating similar immunohistochemical staining pattern to that of the right hilar mass. The characteristic features of the malignant cells in the mediastinum and bone marrow were consistent with a stage IV, low-grade, follicular B-cell lymphoma. \\nRadiation to the mediastinal mass was initiated with concomitant rituximab treatment (375 mg/m2 for four weeks). No adverse reactions were noted during the first two weeks of rituximab induction. However, the patient developed mild, bilateral ocular pruritis and lacrimation three to four weeks within the induction cycle. Maintenance treatment with rituximab (four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2 every six months) was pursued since the patient tolerated the induction cycle without severe complications. Nevertheless, the bilateral eye inflammation became more pronounced after the second cycle of maintenance therapy. In addition to the pruritis and lacrimation, she also developed intense, bilateral periocular erythema, moderate edema, and pain as well as gradual blurring of vision. These manifestations were more prominent in the left eye. She had neither new lymphadenopathy nor any other systemic symptoms. She was then referred to an ophthalmologist for abatement of symptoms and was given topical steroid drops.\\nConcurrent CT of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bilateral orbits revealed no evidence of malignancy or disease recurrence. A left eye conjunctival biopsy was performed to further exclude the possibility of an underlying neoplasm. The biopsy showed an intact epithelium, prominent lymphatic channels with increased stromal lymphocytes (Figure 2). The majority of the lymphocytes expressed CD3, a T-cell marker (Figure 3), with only rare cells reactive for CD79a, a B-cell marker (Figure 4). The CD20 stain was negative (Figure 5). \\nThe severe ocular symptoms gradually subsided within approximately four to six weeks after the last dose of the second rituximab maintenance cycle. However, mild inflammation of the left eye persisted. Moreover, exacerbation of the left eye conjunctivitis was noted one week after the patient received her initial rituximab dose on the third cycle of maintenance regimen. Rituximab was discontinued, and a followup ophthalmology visit was made. Topical antibiotic and steroid drops were utilized for approximately seven days. Two to three weeks after the termination of rituximab, the patient's conjunctivitis has markedly subsided and has completely resolved in the succeeding eight weeks.\",\n",

Her psychomotor development was delayed and she tended to walk on tiptoes. From age 4 years her spastic gait disturbance worsened significantly. At 15 years of age she was still able to walk independently for few meters while requiring a wheelchair to navigate longer distances. At age 27 years her ability to walk was reduced to <10 m with walking aids, around age 30 years she became wheelchair-bound. Her cognitive development was also delayed with delayed speech and language development and a learning disability; after leaving school at 20 years of age she started working at a sheltered workplace.\\nNeurological examination at age 39 years showed severely reduced visual acuity, dysarthria, cerebellar ataxia with saccadic pursuits and upper limb ataxia with intention tremor. She had brisk upper limb reflexes, pyramidal signs and reduced fine motor skills of the upper limbs and severe spastic paraplegia of the lower limbs with adductor and knee extensor spasticity (  3-4 on the Ashworth scale), generalized lower limb weakness (~3/5 on the MRC scale), brisk reflexes and extensor plantar sign. Ophthalmological examination confirmed an optic atrophy, progressive over time; no retinal changes were noted on fundoscopy (Fig. 2). Motor evoked potentials confirmed affection of the corticospinal tracts to upper and lower limbs. Visually evoked potentials demonstrated prolonged P100 latency. Nerve conduction studies were reported normal at age 28 years but indicated a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy later in the disease course (first noted at age 34, progressive at age 39).

The mass had not been present in infancy oradolescence. History of trauma and operations were not found in the patient's history. There was a cyst aspiration story from 2 months ago. On physical examination, a soft-consistency, mobile mass of about 4 cm in size was seen in the left inguinal region. During the Valsalva maneuver, the mass did not change in size and shape. The patient's laboratory findings (complete blood count, urinalysis, blood biochemistry) were within the normal range. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic cystic mass with a size of 40 x 50 mm in the left inguinal area without any vascular flow and no peristalsis (Picture 1).\\nAbdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to examine the communication between the cystic mass and peritoneal cavity, and the precise anatomy around the cystic mass.\\nIt was found that the cystic mass in the inguinal canal included thin septa, and hydrocele of the canal of Nuck was suspected because of the low and high signal intensities observed on the T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Only the wall and septa were contrast-enhanced. The cystic lesion which was seen to be originated from the inguinal canal was excised in the exploration made by suspending the round ligament by passing through the anatomical folds with the incision made from the left inguinal region (Picture 2, Picture 3).The defect was repaired with prolene mesh after high ligation.

       "    'case_text': 'A 58-year-old woman operated with proctocolectomy and an ileal J-pouch 11 years earlier due to ulcerative colitis complicated by colonic cancer presented at a local hospital because of abdominal pain and failure of faecal evacuation. There was a previous history of similar but short and self-resolving episodes of obstruction without clear explanation. A CT-scan aroused suspicion of twisting of the pouch along its longitudinal axis causing an obstruction at the ileoanal anastomosis. An intestinal tube was passed into the pouch for decompression which resulted in relief of symptoms lasting also the day after removal of the tube. She was therefore discharged and referred to our hospital for follow-up with pouchoscopy. However, on the same day as she had been discharged, she presented as an emergency case at our hospital with identical symptoms of obstruction and was admitted to a surgical ward after the application of a tube into the pouch for deflating. Repeated CT-scans at presentation and after application of the tube showed again volvulus of the pouch, which resolved after tube insertion as did the symptoms (Figure 1). Endoscopy of the pouch including 50 cm of the afferent loop was easily done with no signs of ischemia or obvious twisting. The following day a laparotomy was done in order to fixate the pouch to prevent further episodes of twisting. The pouch was found to be enlarged but in its regular position without twisting and not surprisingly there were no adhesions, either in the pelvis or in the abdomen, which made the pouch completely mobile. A loop of the distal ileum was also found to be twisted behind the mesentery of the afferent loop of the pouch as a remaining part of the volvulus (Figure 2). After reduction of the distal ileum a pouchopexy was made with one row of multiple interrupted nonabsorbable monofilament sutures (Prolene) to the presacral fascia as well as closure of the open space behind the mesentery of the afferent loop in the same manner. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged.\\nTwo months later the patient presented with identical symptoms and a CT-scan showed again volvulus of the pouch. Insertion of a tube on this occasion did not fully relieve symptoms, so this led to a decision to proceed to laparotomy. A volvulus of the pouch along its longitudinal axis was found intraoperatively as well as an accompanying volvulus of the small bowel behind the afferent loop similar to the previous laparotomy (Figure 3). No new adhesions had been formed since that laparotomy and all the sutures to the presacral fascia and retroperitoneum were completely detached except for one. The mildly ischemic pouch and small bowel were derotated and fixated once again to the sacral fascia and retroperitoneum but this time with two rows of continuous multifilament sutures (Ethibond) on either side of the pouch. The sutures were also extended upwards to again close the open space behind the afferent loop mesentery (Figure 4). Furthermore the upper corners of the pouch were sutured to the lateral walls of the pelvis. After an uncomplicated postoperative course, the patient was discharged. At follow-up ten months later she was doing well and was free of symptoms.',\n",

The patient recalls ingesting raw camel milk, which is a major risk factor for brucellosis. There was no previous contact with a tuberculosis case. The headache worsened one week before his admission and the patient lost vision in the left eye. His vital signs and cognitive function were normal. Pupils were reactive, but the patient was barely seeing the flash light with his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed an atrophic optic disc mainly with decreased visual acuity bilaterally. Extraocular muscles were intact. The remaining neurological examination was unremarkable.\\nHis diagnostic work up showed total white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.61 x 109 cells/mm3 and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 3.76 mg/L. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acid fast bacilli (AFB) stain and Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (MTB-PCR) were both negative. Blood and CSF cultures were positive for Brucella spp. His serum serological test was positive for B. melitensis and B. abortus. Antibody titers were 1:640 for both strains, just at the cutoff level for the serological diagnosis of the infection. CSF analysis showed elevated WBC count (170 cells/mm3 with 34.9% lymphocytes) and decreased glucose level (34.2 mg/dL). Serum glucose level at that time was 99 mg/dL. CSF protein level was 1.5 g/L while red blood cell (RBC) count was 7 cells/mm3. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain showed multiple, bilateral small dural-based nodular enhancements in both upper frontal lobes (Image 1). The patient was diagnosed with neurobrucellosis. Unfortunately, the patient has completely lost his vision in the left eye with weakened vision in the right eye because of a late presentation and delayed diagnosis. As such, the patient was immediately started on ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously (IV) every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for six weeks along with amikacin 400 mg IV every 12 h for the first three weeks. Three weeks after treatment was initiated, both antibody titers remained at 1:640, which was expected as Brucella antibodies may persist for months after conclusion of therapy. His repeated blood and CSF cultures returned negative a few days after treatment. A repeated MRI of the brain showed interval decrease in the number of the previously reported bilateral frontal leptomeningeal enhancing foci. However, small residual abnormal enhancing foci were still noted. Fortunately, no interval development of new lesions was seen (Image 2).\\nUpon completion of the IV regimen (amikacin and ceftriaxone), the patient was discharged on oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12 h and rifampin 300 mg every 8 h to be taken for 6 months. In an outpatient follow up visit three months later, the patient's vision on the right side was slightly improving. While B. melitensis antibody titer slightly decreased to 1:320, B. abortus antibody titer remained at 1:640. Three months later (six months after discharge), a repeated lumbar puncture showed improved CSF analysis with WBC count of 6 cells/mm3, RBC count of 1 cell/mm3, protein level of 0.55 g/L and glucose level of 46.8 mg/dL (serum glucose level was not obtained at the time of this test). Brucella antibody titer in the serum declined from 1:640 to 1:40 for both strains. At this visit, the decision was made to extend the treatment to 3-6 more months to ensure full recovery. Three months later, a repeated brain MRI showed no more meningeal enhancement and CSF analysis was normal; therefore, antibiotic treatment for brucellosis was stopped.\",\n",

A lumbar puncture revealed no bacterial growth with CSF protein level of 0.7 g/L and glucose level of 126 mg/dL (serum glucose level was 268.2 mg/dL). CSF WBC count was <1 cell/mm3 and RBC count was 8 cells/mm3. AFB stain showed no Mycobacteria, and CSF MTB-PCR did not detect M. tuberculosis. Urine culture came back negative for any bacterial growth. However, a blood culture was positive for Brucella spp. In addition, both B. melitensis and B. abortus antibody titers in the serum exceeded 1:1280. An abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable.

Three weeks before presentation, he was on vacation in Turkey where he consumed raw dairy products at a rural farm. He was febrile but his physical examination was normal otherwise. Lab investigations revealed a CRP level of 13.5 mg/L and CSF analysis showing a WBC count of 59 cells/mm3 (polymorphonuclear cells of 23% and lymphocytes of 71%), RBC count of 3 cells/mm3, protein level of 0.43 g/L and glucose level of 54 mg/dL (serum glucose was 100 mg/dL).

Ten days later, he stared having spikes of fever reaching 40  C, a thorough physical examination and work up were done and they were negative for any potential infection or reason for fever. Thus, antibiotic-induced fever was suspected due to ceftriaxone, thus, it was discontinued despite the overall improvement of the patient's central nervous system symptoms. Ceftriaxone was replaced with ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 8 h. As the fever persisted and liver enzymes were noted to increase, rifampin was stopped as well. In less than a week, rifampin was reintroduced. However, 90 min after the dose, the patient experienced shortness of breath, rash, swelling and redness of skin. His reaction was managed immediately with antihistamine and hydrocortisone. This allergic reaction was presumed to be attributed to rifampin; hence, it was stopped and never introduced again. Moreover, the patient also complained of reduced hearing in his right ear which was suspected to be due to an ototoxic effect of amikacin which resulted in its discontinuation. In order to enhance the management of neurobrucellosis, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) double strength was started orally; yet, the patient had an episode of vomiting, so it was switched to IV which was well tolerated. Later on, as the patient was being prepared for discharge, IV TMP/SMX was stepped down to the oral formulation again. A lumbar puncture was repeated before discharge and showed an improvement from baseline with WBC count of 4 cells/mm3 (lymphocytes of 86%), RBC count of 9 cells/mm3, 0.33 g/L of protein and 61.2 mg/dL of glucose (serum glucose was not available at this point of time). Repeated antibody titers for B. melitensis and B. abortus were 1:640 and 1:320, respectively. The patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h, ciprofloxacin 750 mg orally every 12 h and TMP/SMX double strength orally every 12 h. In his first outpatient visit one month after discharge, the patient admitted to voluntarily discontinuing TMP/SMX due to severe episodes of vomiting and refused to take it again; however, he continued taking doxycycline and ciprofloxacin which resulted in clinical success (after a total of 18 weeks on doxycycline and 16 weeks on ciprofloxacin).\",\n",

Physical examination revealed moderate lower limb weakness with foot drop. It was worse on the left side with lower motor neuron lesion findings. He had normal sensory exam. He reported drinking raw camel milk three months before the first episode of pain with a family member who was diagnosed with brucellosis recently. There was no tuberculosis contact. Since the patient was suspected to have neurobrucellosis, lumbar puncture was done. CSF analysis showed a WBC count of 420 (polymorphonuclear cells of 4% and lymphocytes of 90%) cells/mm3, RBC count of 18 cells/mm3, elevated protein level at 2.45 g/L and glucose level of 21.6 mg/dL (serum glucose was 81 mg/dL). The CSF culture was positive for Brucella species. The acid fast bacilli stain and culture were negative, as well as the MTB-PCR. Other investigations including tests for hepatitis B and C viruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2 were all negative. Serologically, antibody titers results from the CSF for B. melitensis and B. abortuswere 1:160 and 1:80, respectively. His serum titers were not obtained initially. His CRP level was within normal limits. The patient refused to have a tuberculin skin test. An MRI of lumbosacral spine revealed enhancement of cauda equina nerve roots and surface of thecal sac, as well as L5-S1 degenerative changes with central posterior disc bulge indenting the ventral aspect of the thecal sac with no significant neural compromise associated with intervertebral disc dehydration (Image 3). He was admitted as a case of cauda equina syndrome secondary to neurobrucellosis and was started on ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h, amikacin 500 mg IV every 8 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily. The initial plan was to continue the antibiotics with daily physiotherapy then re-evaluate after 6 weeks. However, two weeks into the treatment, the patient's status deteriorated significantly, from difficulty walking to being completely bed bound. Repeated work up showed no other significant findings. Furthermore, after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient started complaining of decreased hearing and pain in both ears resulted in discontinuation of amikacin. Six weeks into therapy, a repeated lumbar puncture did not show a significant improvement with a CSF analysis showing a WBC count of 315 cells/mm3 (polymorphonuclear cells of 41% and lymphocytes of 45%), RBC count of 15 cells/mm3, protein of 3.73 g/L and glucose level of 23.4 mg/dL (serum glucose was 82 mg/dL). Serum antibody titers were 1:320 and 1:80 for B. melitensis and B. abortus, respectively. Since the CSF repeated culture returned negative for Brucella spp., prednisone 1 mg/kg tapering dose was added aiming to reduce further nerve impingement. Luckily, the patient started to show clinical improvement and the IV ceftriaxone was discontinued after completing six weeks of treatment. The patient continued to restore his lower limb power and he was able to transfer to the wheelchair independently. Hence, he was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for one year. The patient was scheduled for follow up in both the infectious diseases and neurology clinics. On his outpatient visits, the patient showed remarkable improvement of his lower limb weakness and he restored the ability to walk again using a cane.

       "    'case_text': 'A 60-year-old woman with a history of severe osteoporosis and previously treated tuberculous lymphadenitis, presented to the emergency department with fever she was experiencing daily for a month that did not respond to antipyretics. This was associated with frontal headache, night sweats, rigors, chills, generalized body ache, unintentional weight loss of 3-4 kg and pain in the lower back and right leg. She reported regular consumption of raw cheese. Investigational workup was done upon admission where a CSF analysis showed 8 cells/mm3 of WBCs (no differential was done), 12 cells/mm3 of RBCs, 0.36 g/L of protein and 54 mg/dL of glucose (serum glucose was not obtained). Blood CRP level was 36 mg/L. She was admitted as a case of possible bacterial meningitis with suspicion of neurobrucellosis. The patient was started on ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily. Three days later, her blood culture returned positive for Brucella spp., However the CSF culture was negative, as well as the AFB stain. Serological testing for hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV 1 and 2 were all negative. High antibody titers for both B. melitensis and B. abortus of 1:1280 were found in the serum whereas it was negative in the CSF. Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h was continued and prescribed for 6 weeks along with amikacin 400 mg IV every 12 h for the same duration, as well as doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h for 6 months and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for 6 months. After about two weeks of treatment, lumbar puncture was repeated and the CSF showed no significant changes with WBC count of 7cells/mm3, RBC count of 1 cells/mm3, protein of 0.33 g/L and glucose of 55.8 mg/dL (serum glucose was not available). During hospitalization, the patient felt generally better and became afebrile. After completing the IV antibiotics course (ceftriaxone and amikacin), lumbar puncture was ordered, but the patient refused to undergo the procedure. Consequently, the patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily for 6 months. During her follow up visits, the patient reported feeling well and afebrile with remarkable improvement of the headache. The follow up antibody titer was 1:320 for both Brucella strains, which continued to decrease until it reached 1:160 after completing 6 months of antibiotic therapy. As such, treatment was discontinued.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 44-year-old man with a history of recurrent epididymo-orchitis presented to the emergency department complaining of an on-and-off scrotal pain for the last 15 days and low grade fever for which he was given ciprofloxacin for 10 days and acetaminophen (paracetamol) from another hospital. This regimen helped managing his symptoms; however, they were not resolved rendering him seeking medical help at our institution. There were no histories of contact with a tuberculosis patient or raw milk consumption. On physical examination, his scrotum was enlarged, swollen and tender. An ultrasound revealed both testes were of normal size; however, there was bilateral significant increased vascularity in both testicles and both epididymal heads. The scrotal skin was not thickened. There was a slightly increased echogenicity of both testes and a small left hydrocele was identified.\\nThere were a few (about four) tiny echogenic foci noted within the left testicle likely representing small calcifications. Physical examination findings of regional lymph nodes and skin were not significant. While awaiting other investigations, the patient was started on ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 h as an empiric therapy. Blood culture came back negative for Brucella spp.; however, antibody titers were positive for B. melitensis and B. abortus at 1:1280 for both strains. CRP level was 6.8 mg/L. The patient was diagnosed with Brucella epididymo-orchitis, but refused to undergo lumbar puncture for further investigation. Due to lack of clinical improvement, ciprofloxacin was discontinued three days later and was replaced by ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 900 mg orally once daily. After two doses of 900 mg rifampin, the dose was decreased to 600 mg orally once daily though nothing in the patient's notes indicated the reason for the dose change nor the liver enzymes were elevated. After ten days of treatment, ceftriaxone was stopped and the patient was discharged on doxycycline 100 mg orally every 12 h and rifampin 600 mg orally once daily for a minimum period of three months. Before discharge, the patient was clinically improving as demonstrated by the decreased swelling and tenderness of his scrotum. On his first visit as an outpatient 2 weeks after discharge, the patient reported no new complications and appeared clinically well. Tests showed no signs of drug-induced hepatotoxicity, so the rifampin dose was increased to 900 mg orally once daily. On examination, his scrotum appeared to be relieved of the swelling and decreased in size. CRP level decreased slightly to 5.21 mg/L. A week later, the patient came again for follow up. While the patient did not show up for the next visit, his Brucella epididymoorchitis was deemed cured based on the improved clinical findings and decreased CRP. No repeated serology was done.\",\n",

She was treated in another hospital symptomatically for bone pain with no improvement. Her past medical history was irrelevant except for vitamin D deficiency.\\nOn initial examination, she was afebrile, both knees were tender at joint line, with swelling over the anteromedial aspect of upper part of tibia with erythematous overlying skin. Patellar tap and ballottement tests as well as crepitus test were negative. Visual field testing revealed left homonymous superior quadrantanopia with normal visual acuity. Detailed slit lamp examination was insignificant and showed no involvement of retina. Complete blood count was normal at the time of presentation. Creatinine, urea, and electrolytes were within normal limits. High alkaline phosphatase and normal lactate dehydrogenase were present. Plain X-ray of both knees showed multiple sclerotic patches of the distal femur and upper parts of both tibiae (Figure 1) while bilateral tibia magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral lesions replacing the normal fatty signal intensity in the T1 weighted images (Figure 2). Initial brain MRI showed bilateral well-defined round intensely enhancing lesions located in the temporal poles lateral to the amygdala and anterior to the temporal horns with thickened enhanced pituitary stalk (Figure 3), in conjunction with partially empty sella and absent bright signal of the neurohypophysis (Figure 4). Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed increased FDG uptake in temporal lobes and facial and long bones (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). She was further investigated for malignancies, paraneoplastic, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and toxic causes. All tumor markers were within normal limits.\\nLeft tibial biopsy was performed to rule out malignancy and showed marrow infiltration with sheets of foamy histiocytes with the presence of sclerosed trabeculae. The immunohistochemistry showed CD-1a negative histiocytes; however, molecular pathology showed negative BRAF mutation. The clinical, radiological, and immunohistochemical characteristics were consistent with ECD. The patient was started on standard interferon alpha 135 mg per week for a duration of 3 weeks and methylprednisolone with improvement of her symptoms after 1 week.\\nOne year later, the patient presented with double vision and left ophthalmoplegia. On examination, she was found to have unequal pupils and papilledema. Brain MRI showed new enhancing lesion in the vicinity of the left cavernous sinus (Figure 6), with pachymeningeal thickening along the tentorial leaflets and interval regression of the mesial temporal lobe lesions.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 55-year-old-woman with a history of multiple TMJ surgeries presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of limited mouth opening and difficulty bringing her teeth together. Her surgical history was significant for the placement of bilateral PTIPIs in the 1980s, followed by bilateral total joint replacement with Kent-Vitek Inc. (Houston, TX) TMJ prostheses, and most recently removal of the right total joint prosthesis. Her medical history was relevant for fibromyalgia, for which she was on gabapentin 300 mg three times daily, as well as anxiety and depression, which was treated with bupropion 150 mg once daily, duloxetine 60 mg once daily, and alprazolam 2 mg as needed. She also had a history of a large cutaneous ulcer over the right temporal region which was initially thought to have been caused by a foreign body reaction to the implant material, though an incisional biopsy showed findings consistent with trichotillomania.\\nExamination revealed right cranial nerve VII deficit, treated with an eyebrow lift, with persistent weakness of the right upper and lower lids of approximately 25-30%. She had bilateral preauricular swelling and well-healed preauricular and submandibular incisions. Her interincisal range of motion was 14 mm, with a gap of 2 mm in her maximally closed position. Her pain score was 7/10 intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with her pain reportedly worst in the right jaw. Radiographic examination with both panoramic radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scan showed partial edentulism of the maxilla and mandible. There was a mass of hypertrophic bone in the right TMJ area. The left mandible showed a total joint prosthesis with the condylar component displaced. Figure 1 shows a panoramic radiograph taken at initial consultation.\\nOver the course of a year, she underwent three separate surgeries: (1) prior embolization of the adjacent right maxillary artery, removal of the right heterotopic bone, removal of the left TMJ prosthesis, bilateral TMJ reconstruction with temporary condylar implants (DuPuy-Synthes, Westchester, PA) and abdominal fat grafts to the dead spaces, (2) removal of the temporary implants and placement of custom-made total TMJ implants (TMJ Implants, Ventura, CA) (3) revision of the left TMJ hardware due to instability. The surgical pathology from each of these surgeries showed evidence of foreign material consistent with retained Proplast-Teflon particles with an associated foreign body giant cell reaction. Following the surgeries, the patient showed significantly improved function with an improved range of motion of 34 mm mouth opening as well as the ability to fully occlude her teeth. Figure 2 shows a panoramic radiograph following her series of surgeries. Despite the improved ability to open and close her mouth to speak and eat, she reported persistent pain scored as a 7/10 intensity. She also developed synkinesis of the facial muscles, which responded to treatment with tizanidine 2 mg twice daily.\\nThe patient returned three years later with a chief complaint of persistent right-sided pain. Her range of motion was maintained at 35 mm, and her dental occlusion was stable Examination revealed pain on palpation of the right preauricular area and coronoid process. A CT scan revealed no signs of hardware failure. Metal allergy testing for a potential allergy to the prostheses was negative. Serology showed negative rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and HLA-B27, as well as vitamin D levels within normal limits. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were mildly elevated.\\nTo diagnose and treat her pain, collaborative care between her TMJ surgeon, orofacial pain specialist, and neurologist led to various trials of injection therapy (nerve blocks, trigger point injections, and Botox to the right masticatory muscles) and pharmacotherapy (gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline, baclofen, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine). The only treatments that brought her relief were right-sided occipital nerve blocks and right inferior alveolar nerve blocks, which reduced her pain from 7-8/10 down to 4-5/10 intensity for several hours. As part of her comprehensive treatment for chronic pain, she was referred to a pain psychologist; however, after undergoing an initial consultation, the patient declined follow-up care.\\nOver the course of a year, the patient\\'s pain became more lancinating in nature predominantly in the distribution of the cranial nerve V2 and V3 branches, with pain triggered by touch and cold air, which was concerning for right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. An MRI of her brain revealed no mass lesions or vascular contact leading to compression of the trigeminal nerve. After consultation with a neurosurgeon, she underwent a balloon compression rhizotomy of the right Gasserian ganglion which resolved the lancinating pain.\\nFollowing this procedure, she reported a flare of a different type of pain emanating from the right TMJ area. She rated this pain as 8/10 intensity and described it \"like a bad ear infection,\" with pain radiating to \"[her] right cheek, sinus, eye, and forehead.\" She continued on tizanidine 2 mg twice daily, which helped with the muscle pain, as well as baclofen 10 mg three times daily, which reduced pain in the occipital region. She most recently returned to our practice in severe distress with right-sided jaw pain, requesting inpatient admission for pain management and mentioning suicidal thoughts due to her constant pain.\\nDiscussion with her primary care physician (PCP) revealed that she had suffered from chronic pain for the 20+ years he had known her, with consequences of social isolation and suicidal ideation having been present throughout this time. Her PCP also stated that trials with different anti-depressants had not been helpful in improving her mood or quality of life. Her orofacial pain team confirmed that suicidal ideation had been a recurring theme and that her long clinical course was in part due to her distrust of medical and surgical providers, the failure of multiple attempts to relieve her pain, and the complications that she suffered from each surgical intervention. Consultation with a psychiatrist specializing in chronic pain led to recommendations of long-term psychological support to help her cope with the pain, with an emphasis on helping her understand the neurobiological connection between depression and chronic pain. Her Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data showed that over the past two years, her opioids and benzodiazepines had been predominantly prescribed by her PCP and she had used one pharmacy. Her mean morphine milligram equivalency (MME) was 62 per day, with occasional spikes to 125 MME, and her mean lorazepam milligram equivalency (LME) was 8.6 per day, with occasional spikes to 17 mg LME.\\nUltimately, because she had re-gained a functional range of mandibular motion, no additional surgical intervention was recommended. For pain control, it was recommended that she remain on hydromorphone 2 mg every 4 hours as needed as well as engage in a longitudinal psychiatric program with an emphasis on behavioral health and skills to cope with her pain. The patient agreed that further hospital care would be contingent upon involvement in behavioral health modalities.\\nIn 1934, Costen, an otolaryngologist, published an article stating that TMJ symptoms were caused by mandibular displacement as a result of missing posterior teeth. Various iterations of this theory have permeated clinical practice since then and continue to distort our thinking today. Over the following decades, a progressively more scientific approach has been advocated, recognizing the biopsychosocial etiology of these symptoms and the complex nature of these chronic pain conditions, now called temporomandibular disorders.\\nOriginally, our understanding of one of these disorders - the painful clicking and locked jaw - was based on our knowledge of anatomy. With the development of imaging techniques, such as arthrography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgeons gained the ability to visualize the meniscus of the TMJ at rest and in motion. These imaging modalities supported the notion of internal derangement of the meniscus as pathology and popularized open joint surgery for meniscal repair or repositioning. Thus, presented with a patient in pain with limited range of motion, an image demonstrating derangement and pathology persuaded oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFSs) to contemplate surgical repair, although the rationale of these decisions was suspect. Repositioning of the meniscus became a popular intervention but proved to be unreliable in some cases. Accordingly, starting in the mid-1980s, meniscal replacement came into vogue and a variety of materials were used, including ear cartilage, dura, fascia, temporalis myofascial flaps, metal, Silastic, and Proplast-Teflon. It is the PTIPI which is the subject of this review.\\nIn 1967, a biochemist named Dr. Charles Homsy was working at DuPont, a chemical and manufacturing company, where he was warned by the company about the dangers of implanted Teflon in the body.  In 1968, he developed a material called Proplast, which he would later patent. Dr. Homsy ultimately left DuPont and founded Vitek, Inc. (VI), a small company located in Texas, to develop, manufacture, and market PTIPIs. Proplast was utilized as it is a porous form of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that allows for infiltration of soft tissue, thereby stabilizing the implant. Teflon, manufactured by DuPont, is a dense form of PTFE and was added to the TMJ interpositional implant to provide a smooth gliding surface across which the mandibular condyle could move. Many years prior, in 1963, a British orthopedic surgeon, Dr. John Charnley, warned against the use of PTFE in joints stating, \"Surgeons, and especially orthopedic surgeons, should be warned that tissue reactions are likely to follow the implantation of polytetrafluorethylene if this material is subjected to abrasion and that these reactions may not be manifest for two years.\" In March 1983, VI notified the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which had authority over the use of implantable medical devices, stating that VI was planning to market the PTIPI for the TMJ, based on the claim that it was substantially equivalent to an existing product (silicone sheeting) that was also being used as a TMJ implant. Its biocompatibility was based on in vitro studies and alveolar ridge augmentation studies. No animal or biomechanical studies were performed until after its introduction into clinical practice, at which time the adverse effects came to light. The FDA agreed, and the PTIPI was allowed to be marketed. \\nInitially, there were encouraging reports, with success rates estimated in the 90% range. However, problems were soon reported on the damage that these implants were causing. In 1985, Ryan published a series of 105 joints in 67 patients studied for 25 months, finding that patients who originally had no radiographic or surgical evidence of arthrosis developed varying degrees of arthrosis, and those who had had arthrosis developed progression of their disease subsequent to implantation with PTFE-aluminum oxide implants. In cases of severe arthrosis, MRIs demonstrated loss of signal in the condyle, loss of temporal bone, presence of large soft tissue masses, and fragmentation of the implants. At surgery, all implants were found to be perforated, 50% were folded, and 17% were fragmented or separated into two components. Four cases demonstrated perforation through the temporal bone with exposure of the dura. Histologic studies of the peri-implant tissue yielded exuberant foreign body giant cell reactions with secondary features of chronic inflammation.\\nIn 1987, the US Air Force reported problems to VI and the FDA, and in the following year, the FDA conducted its first inspection of VI. Symptoms including pain, radiographic evidence of severe bone loss in the condyle and glenoid fossa, bite changes, limited jaw motion, joint noises, nausea, dizziness, ringing in the ears, fragmentation and/or displacement of the implant, infection, vision and hearing changes, sinus infections and flu-like symptoms were noted. Subsequently, many papers have documented radiographic changes, pathologic reactions, and clinical symptoms.\\nAs no complete registry of patients was maintained, the exact number of patients who had PTIPIs implanted is uncertain. Originally VI stated that 12,500 implants were distributed, but an analysis by the District Court of Dallas indicated that the implants were distributed in packs of two, and on that basis, approximately 26,000 units were manufactured and distributed. Data from insurance companies showed a disproportionate number of patients who underwent TMJ surgery were young women between 18-44 years of age. There were also regional differences, with the South being over-represented compared to the Midwest and West/Northeast. Ironically, insurance companies may have contributed to the problem by denying noninvasive treatment modalities for their insureds\\' TMJ symptoms but covering the surgical procedures.\\nThe clinical consequences of the failure of PTIPIs have become quite apparent. Many of these patients now suffer from chronic pain, mandibular hypomobility, and malocclusion because of multiple surgeries. These symptoms affect their activities of daily living, such as talking, eating, toothbrushing, and receiving regular dental care. Severe limitation of mouth opening may also put them at risk of choking if they require emergency intubation. Other studies have documented the subsequent problems that these patients face when they undergo reconstruction of their damaged TMJs. From 1984 through 1998, the FDA received 434 adverse event reports for TMJ implants (all types), 58% of which were associated with patient injuries and 28% of which were device malfunctions. Over 75% of these reports cited two manufacturers, Dow Corning and VI - both of which have ceased production of TMJ implants. The most frequent patient problems reported include surgery to remove the implant, pain, foreign body reactions, and loss of range of motion. A pilot study of surgically retrieved TMJ alloplastic implants similarly demonstrated that pain was a significant symptom associated with perforation of the implants.\\nOur own review of 95 patients with end-stage TMJ disease that underwent TMJ replacement with total joint prostheses demonstrates clearly that a subset of patients who had a history of failed PTIPI fared less well than those with other diagnoses (for example, ankylosis, inflammatory disease, and trauma). While on average, the TMJ replacement patients experienced increased range of motion and decreased pain, the subset of 27 patients exposed to PTIPIs was older, had almost twice the number of prior surgeries, had greater limitation of mouth opening prior to surgery, and achieved less range of motion postoperatively, with all of these differences reaching statistical significance.\\nThe general health consequences of these failed implants have also been documented. A non-profit patient advocacy organization, the TMJ Association, has documented patient reports of the presence of flu-like symptoms, chronic sinus infections, skin reactions, local and distant lymphadenopathy, as well as immune system problems. In 1999, Baird and Rea reported a small series (n=14) of chronically ill, chemically sensitive patients with multisystem end-order disease and labeled this \"Implant Syndrome Complex.\" Severe pain was the predominant symptom, with all of the 3 patients whose histories were described in detail reporting severe pain.\\nFrom the patient\\'s perspective, the aftermath of this event was not properly handled. Many complained that they had not been fully informed of the consequences of the implant surgery or that they were unaware of the recall and need for follow-up. When they were seen by their OMFSs, the evaluation was usually limited to a panoramic radiograph, leading to false reassurances that all was well. When they requested their records, oftentimes they were lost or missing due to office fires or flooding. Patient advocacy groups, newspaper articles, and patient blogs have also told the story of failed implants, multiple surgeries, and continuing symptoms.\\nWhile Dupont manufactured and supplied Teflon for the PTIPI, they played no part in the design, specifications, sales, or distribution of the implants. However, they faced 650 lawsuits by 1500 patients in 42 states in the United States and Canada. In almost all of the US cases, they were found not liable for the safety of the VI product and not considered negligent, as \"suppliers of safe multi-purpose raw materials have no duty to warn the ultimate consumer of a finished product about dangers that may exist when the raw materials are integrated into the final product.\"\\nVI, on the other hand, which had manufactured and marketed the PTIPI, was the subject of personal injury lawsuits beginning in 1987. They successfully defended the first two suits in jury trials and lost the third in late 1989. The company ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1990. The founder, Dr. Charles Homsy, fled the US and now lives in Switzerland. He blamed the oral and maxillofacial surgery community and patients for the failure of the implants, and the FDA for its restrictive practices. In 1991, the FDA seized the remaining implants and buried them in a landfill in Houston, TX. In 1997, the bankruptcy court settlement with the litigants awarded funds amounting to less than $10,000 per patient. The Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service/Endispute, Houston reported that 2217 legal claims were made against VI, excluding over 500 who accepted the $1000 settlement as final compensation, with a maximum settlement of approximately $8000. In reviewing the Referee\\'s Report, the example given provided a settlement of approximately $2800 (worth approximately $4769 today).\\nOne of the VI OMFS consultants conducted animal experiments after the implant failures were reported. The results were \"essentially catastrophic.\" In a letter to Dr. Homsy, he stated that VI might have a \"calamity of unbelievable proportions on our hands.\" The consultant owned 21,000 VI shares and collected royalties and wrote articles praising VI implants, but eventually conceded that the implants had a predicted in vivo life span of only 3 years.\\nThe role of the FDA has been critically evaluated by several authors, and chronologies of these events are available from the FDA among other sources. Figure 3 provides a timeline of the initial manufacturing and clinical application of the VI PTIPI and the role of the FDA in regulating its use, as well as scientific literature published on PTIPIs throughout the years. Since the 1976 Medical Device Amendments were instituted, the FDA has had jurisdiction over medical devices entering the market. Despite PTFE having been condemned by Charnley for joints in 1982, VI filed intent to market PTIPI claiming it to be \"substantially equivalent\" to Silastic, which was already being used in TMJ surgery. Its biocompatibility was based on in vitro studies and alveolar ridge augmentation studies. In 1983, FDA notified VI that the IPI is equivalent to devices marketed prior to the FDA\\'s 1976 Medical Device Amendment and granted 510(k) premarket notification status. Later that year, VI initiated commercial distribution of the implants.\\nIn 1987, the US Air Force reported problems to VI and the FDA. In 1988, the FDA became aware of complaints about the PTIPI implants and explants showing bone resorption, implant fragmentation, and delamination, and as a result, conducted its first inspection of VI. In 1989, the FDA issued VI a regulatory letter for medical device reporting and good manufacturing practices violations. In January 1990, the FDA issued a letter to VI advising it to warn all OMFSs against implanting further devices and monitoring their patients until further clinical data were available. Thus, in March 1990, VI issued a \"Dear Doctor\" letter to OMFSs, informing them of the hazards associated with the PTIPI product and advising them to closely monitor all patients through clinical and radiographic examination. The FDA classified this action as a voluntary safety alert. Consequently, VI filed for bankruptcy in June 1990. Shortly thereafter, the FDA issued VI a letter stating that its voluntary safety alert was ineffective, as an audit check had disclosed that some consignees were never notified. In December 1990, FDA reclassified VI\\'s voluntary status alert to a class I recall and issued a safety alert to all OMFSs, urging them to refrain from using the devices and to return all unused devices to the VI bankruptcy trustee. The FDA also rescinded 510(k) status for VI PTIPI, seized the remaining implants and issued a safety alert to all OMFSs. In 1991, the FDA recalled the VI PTIPI - the first recall for this agency - and issued a medical alert to patients. The United States Congress held hearings on TMJ implants in 1992. In 1994, FDA reclassified TMJ Implants as class III devices, subject to premarket approval.\\nFDA oversight of the PTIPI has been called into question pertaining to several issues. Because TMJ implants were classified as 510(k) status, they avoided critical review for several years. There was no system to track the devices, as this was not a component of the FDA inspection process. MedWatch was a voluntary reporting system, and in 1986, reports on VI PTIPI were dismissed. The FDA \"seems to have missed several opportunities to intervene and head off the IPI disaster,\" with one oral surgeon reporting, \"The FDA was asleep at the switch.\"\\nIn his 1995 Hastings lecture, then FDA Commissioner Dr. David A. Kessler discussed some of the challenges that faced the agency regarding the introduction of medical devices and the role of the FDA \"in piloting their path from the bench to the bedside.\" Citing Shiley heart valves, silicone gel-filled breast implants, and TMJs as examples of problem devices, he explained the several areas for which the FDA was strengthening its activities in product approval, post market surveillance, enforcement, research, and education, noting that \"health care practitioners, too, have a responsibility to let us know when they see problems with a device.\".\\nDr. Charles Homsy worked at the Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, and developed Proplast in a laboratory there. A lawsuit was filed against the hospital in 1994. The suit was settled in 1996 for $30 million and $975 million in costs. Individual patients were paid between $15,000 and $100,000, in addition to 3% for loss of consortium. The Baylor College of Medicine and the Methodist Hospital were also sued, as tests on components of the PTIPI had been conducted in their facilities and the Methodist Hospital had licensed the manufacture of Proplast to VI. Baylor did not settle and most of the cases were dismissed.\\nIn a review of mass tort cases in 1999 based on published sources, TMJ injury claims that PTIPIs led to fragmentation, pain, and bony and soft tissue damage were compared to claims of damage due to breast implants and orthopedic screws. PTIPI claims were far fewer than those against manufacturers of breast implants or orthopedic screws, as the total number of estimated exposures was considerably smaller. However, in the case of PTIPI, the cause of damage was highly identifiable. Notably, PTIPI defendants had a low ability to pay following VI filing for bankruptcy, whereas breast and orthopedic screw implant defendants had a higher ability to pay. By 1999, the PTIPI cases were closed, with the other two categories remaining open. The claims to exposure ratio was similar for the PTIPI and orthopedic screw categories, and much higher for the breast implants.\\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) published the FDA safety warning without comment. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) sent the FDA safety alert, public health advisory, and TMJ implant advisory to members both in 1992 and 1993. However, the organization took no official advisory position. In 1992, the AAOMS held a workshop on the issue, chronicling the history of AAOMS involvement, reviewing the literature, and offering recommendations for managing patients with alloplastic TMJ implants. The workshop furthermore stated that \"the recommendations presented represent a consensus of the workshop participants and are not an official statement of AAOMS.\" AAOMS later published its first document describing the parameters of care in 1992. Now in its 6th version, the section on TMJ surgery recognizes \"that many patients undergoing TMJ surgeries have unique pain control requirements,\"\\' and that \"this field has undergone a considerable evolution in the past 15-20 years.\" In regard to alloplastic materials, the document states that \"when alloplastics are used, they should be employed following the manufacturer\\'s instructions and consistent with indications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.\"\\nIn legal disputes, the AAOMS Risk Management group (Oral Surgery National Insurance Company-OMSNIC) defended the profession. At the time, it was headed by an OMFS who had authored an article on 301 patients who had been implanted, and the article blamed the OMFSs and the patients for the implant failures. It was the last article to be published that defended the implant. Many lawsuits were brought against OMFSs who had implanted the device and were vigorously pursued. Figure 4 shows the premise for each side of the debate.\\nIn one example of a class action suit brought by 21 plaintiffs and 13 spouses, the plaintiffs filed complaints asserting claims of product liability, breach of warranty, negligence, and loss of consortium. Three of the claims were dismissed; however, negligence both prior and subsequent to the implant surgery was re-evaluated and subsequently hinged on whether the defendants \"failed to include as part of their informed consent process before surgery any mention of all the reports of foreign body tissue reactions, bone resorption, immune reaction, or long-term immunological response.\" After the surgery, the defendants failed \"to provide adequate information from which the claimants could make informed judgments about whether and when to have the Vitek implants removed.\" The case languished in the courts and was ultimately dismissed.\\nThe positive and negative results of PTIPI were predominantly published in peer-reviewed OMFS journals. The editor of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the time stated that starting in 1986, doctors knew of patients suffering from \"extensive resorption of bone and marked tissue inflammation\" as well as \"intense pain, jaw dysfunction, and occasional changes in the bite.\" He reviewed the FDA\\'s response \"in the instance of the Teflon/Proplast (Vitek Inc., Houston, TX) fiasco\" and concluded \"One can no longer use the issue of FDA approval as an excuse if a device eventually proves to be ineffective.\" In defense of the publication of scientific articles which subsequently turn out to be inaccurate, it can argued that journal editors rely on their reviewers when deciding to publish articles and those views can be biased, ill-informed, or erroneous for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, it is clear that science changes over time and that our view of scientific authenticity can change as a result of new scientific observations as well as other factors.\\nAll clinicians are bound by ethical standards that define the framework within which they work. Many articles and guidelines have been published to define these principles, with the four core bioethical principles being respect for patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Embedded within these principles are several items that apply to the PTIPI incident, including: informed consent, truth-telling, good communication skills, ability to exercise sound judgement, research and innovation in surgery, responsible conduct, minimizing harm, recognizing the limitation of one\\'s professional competence, research and auditing, disclosure and discussion of surgical complications including medical errors, and whistle blowing. A full discussion of each of these points is beyond the scope of this article, although in a statement that speaks more directly to this affair, Adedeji and colleagues wrote, \"The surgical profession as a whole has the obligation to improve surgical outcomes and reduce complications by conducting research and participating in systematic programs of quality improvement. This requires keeping detailed and accurate data on the incidence of adverse events.\" Adedeji additionally suggests that the burden of proof for any innovative surgical technique lies with the surgeon, who should be prepared to justify such medical decisions to professional colleagues. Establishing these protocols within an ethical framework is the role of Institutional Review Boards which regulate such activities within medical institutions. Several of the principles were seemingly ignored and ethical issues were insufficiently addressed in the PTIPI affair.\\nThe issue of financial reward associated with PTIPIs has attracted very little attention. The companies involved in the manufacture and distribution of these implants as well as their officers, shareholders, and consultants were legitimately in the business for financial gain. Likewise, the OMFSs and the hospitals at which they worked expected to be compensated for their efforts to help patients. For OMFSs, it was \"a bona fide business opportunity.\" It has been suggested that a conflict of interest existed when oral surgeons owned the implants and were subsequently the distributors, as well as the implanting surgeons. The VI recall notice requested that OMFSs \"do not implant any more of these devices if you have any of them in your possession. These implants should be returned for credit. Return these implants to the address below in their original boxes, if available, a copy of the corresponding shipping memorandum.\"\\nIt has been reported that the chief VI clinical consultant owned less than 1% of the company\\'s stock and received a royalty payment of 2-4% of the price of certain products sold, amounting to \"about $50,000 a year, he says (although Dr. Homsy pegs it closer to $100,000 some years).\" Hospitals now have conflict of interest policies to which medical staff and surgeons are expected to abide. These typically contain questions regarding financial interests in pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies.\\nCurrent thinking about the cause of accidents, adverse events, and near misses in the healthcare field focuses on the several events that need to coincide to create an adverse situation. In any event, hazards exist, and the layers of defense can be breached by latent conditions or active failures, as noted in the \"Swiss Cheese model\" of failure (Figure 5). In the chain of events leading up to the harm that PTIPIs caused, specifically where were the failures?\\nSome of the disturbing aspects of the PTIPI incident include the lax regulatory environment at the time, particularly the lack of oversight by manufacturers, such as DuPont, whose products were brought to market by independent companies, such as VI. Importantly, there was a failure of the developers of the PTIPI to recognize or acknowledge the unique features of the TMJ and the empirical literature indicating that this material would fail under loading forces in the joint. In addition, there was a slow and inadequate response of professional organizations, including the AAOMS and ADA, in protecting the public. Furthermore, there was an insistent reliance upon poorly understood technology and an unproven procedure to treat articular disc derangements of the TMJ, which we now know to be a generally self-limiting with a natural history that can resolve over time. The fact that this episode affected a small subspecialty surgical group and a small number of patients, at least in comparison to other implant controversies, in no way mitigates the tragedy of the situation, nor the federal, institutional, and professional responsibilities that were not met.\\nThe contrary view supports the decisions made at the time by the OMFSs involved, based on current knowledge and the imperative to treat patients who were in pain, had dysfunction, and were demanding relief. The legal concept of \"standard of care\" evolves over time and is generally considered to be \"what a minimally competent [surgeon] would do in the same situation, with the same resources,\" which turns out to be a fairly low bar in this situation. TMJ surgeries represented relatively simple procedures, with doctors describing the procedure with phrases such as, \"We\\'ll slip this little disc, and you\\'ll be out of the hospital in two to three days.\" The surgeries often presented an alternative to prolonged and ineffective non-surgical treatment modalities that were either failing to alleviate the symptoms or expensive (for example, extensive orthodontic and/or restorative treatment and orthognathic surgery to provide a \"better occlusion\"). In addition, indications for surgery were justified by imaging (CT or MRI) that showed derangement or pathology of the TMJ. Thus, it could be said that the failure of the PTIPI was not so much a problem with the implant material as it was with the OMFSs and patients who did not follow instructions.',\n",

She had previously been noted to have 'freckles' on her left retina. At the time of diagnosis the patient was asymptomatic, suffered no visual impairment and declined further investigation, radiotherapy or enucleation. A one-year follow up showed growth of the uveal melanoma with staging undertaken prior to intended radiotherapy. An abdominal CT scan demonstrated a lesion within segments 4 and 7 of her liver (Fig. 1). A Further PET scan showed a focal area of FDG avidity within segment 4 but no increased FDG uptake in liver segment 7,\\nA diagnostic laparoscopy was performed for the liver lesions of unknown origin. Intraoperatively, no free intraperitoneal fluid was seen but numerous peritoneal nodules were noted on the diaphragmatic and peritoneal surfaces, particularly in the right upper quadrant. There was no obvious omental disease. These peritoneal nodules along with the liver lesion were biopsied. The liver biopsy showed focally necrotic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical labeling was in keeping with cholangiocarcinoma and in the absence of a primary site in the extrahepatic biliary system or upper gastrointestinal tract the lesion was considered to likely represent a primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The lesion did not label for any immunohistochemical markers for melanoma. The peritoneal biopsy showed nodular proliferations of mesothelial cells with infiltration into the submesothelial adipose tissue indicative of malignant mesothelioma of epithelial type. Immunohistochemistry was positive for mesothelial markers and negative for carcinoma markers.\\nThe patient's father and brother had both died of malignant mesothelioma (Fig. 2) having had occupational exposure to asbestos. The patient herself had no occupational exposure to asbestos but may have had ongoing household exposure since the 1970s. Her past medical history was unremarkable besides beta thalassemia minor and a previous hysterectomy for benign disease. The patient was of Greek descent. She was a non-smoker and only occasionally drank alcohol. The patient had four children, and two of these had passed away with renal cell carcinoma and acute lymphocytic leukaemia at ages 41 and 17 respectively (Fig. 2).\\nElective surgical resection was deemed appropriate for the patient's primary liver mass. A CT prior to resection demonstrated no change in the liver lesion and no evidence of extrahepatic spread. Intraoperatively, a firm porta hepatic node was identified with frozen sectioning confirming metastatic adenocarcinoma. Fine needle aspiration of the segment 7 also showed adenocarcinoma and in view of positive intra- and extrahepatic disease the liver resection was abandoned. A strip of peritoneum was also removed which again demonstrated malignant mesothelioma.\\nIn light of her uveal melanoma and malignant mesothelioma, combined with her family history of mesothelioma it was suspected that the patient might have BAP1 hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome. Testing for BAP1 mutations by immunohistochemistry showed loss of nuclear BAP1 labeling in the primary biliary tract adenocarcinoma, but nuclear labeling for BAP1 was retained in the malignant mesothelioma (Fig. 3). No biopsies were taken from the uveal melanoma. Germline DNA sequencing was performed and revealed the patient to carry a germline missense mutation in the catalytic domain (g.52441252A > G, p.Tyr173Cys) located in exon 7 of the BAP1 gene (Fig. 4). This mutation is predicted to generate a non-functional full-length protein, due to impairment of its ubiquitin hydrolase activity.\\nFurther CT surveillance of the patient demonstrated an enlarging liver mass, development of new liver lesions and increasing portacaval lymph nodes. No other distant sites of metastasis where identified on CT. The patient become symptomatic 23 months after the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and mesothelioma and was commenced on palliative chemotherapy. She passed away 31 months after diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and mesothelioma due to progression of her intraabdominal malignancies.\",\n",

Family history was notable for renal malignancy in the patient's grandmother. The physical examination was unremarkable, with no palpable flank mass or tenderness. Laboratory studies were notable for a creatinine of 2.02 (eGFR = 34 ml/min), up from a baseline of 1.60 (eGFR = 42 ml/min). Renal ultrasound revealed a 12 x 15 cm predominantly solid mass in the right kidney with internal cystic changes and central flow. In the left kidney renal ultrasound revealed a solid-appearing mass in the upper pole measuring 6.5 x 6 x 5.5 cm, a hypoechoic structure measuring 4.8 x 4.1 x 4.6 cm in the lower pole, and an adjacent 6.1 x 5.8 x 6.4 cm solid left lower pole renal mass with a small amount of central flow. Computed Tomography (CT) revealed a 14 x 13 x 16 cm right renal mass almost completely replacing the interpolar region, with significant mass effect on the right kidney (Figures 1 and 2). Adjacent tissue nodularity in the perinephric fat was concerning for satellite nodules or metastatic disease (Figure 1). Right retroperitoneal adenopathy measuring 2.4 x 2.7 cm at the level of the renal hilum was identified. In addition, multiple 2-3 cm hyper- and isodense indeterminate soft tissue lesions were identified in the right kidney. The left kidney was notable for multiple solid renal masses measuring 6.3 cm at the upper pole and 4.6 cm at the interpolar region (Figure 3). A left paraaortic soft tissue mass measuring 4.6 x 4.6 cm with associated calcification was concerning for adenopathy (Figure 3). Whole body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging was obtained to evaluate for metastatic disease. PET/CT revealed bilateral metabolically active solid renal masses concerning for malignancy and metabolic activity in a left paraaortic soft tissue mass concerning for lymphadenopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no evidence of inferior vena cava thrombus.\\nThe patient was discussed in a multidisciplinary oncology meeting and the decision was made to proceed with surgical extirpation of the right kidney and the paraaortic mass. We performed an open right radical nephrectomy with right retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and excision of left paraaortic mass.\\nGrossly, the right kidney contained a spherical, encapsulated, and homogenous maroon-colored mass with a gray-white lobulated central scar (Figure 4). Two additional smaller masses with similar gross appearance but without central scar were also present. Histologic examination revealed nests of round and polygonal cells with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure 5) consistent with oncocytoma. Immunohistochemical staining of the right renal mass with colloidal iron, CD117, CK7, RCC, and CD10 was performed. The tumor cells were positive for CD117, CK7 (Figure 6), and weakly positive for CD10. The tumor cells were negative for Hale colloidal iron and RCC.\\nCross sections of the left paraaortic mass revealed a smooth, encapsulated mass with a pearly and glistening tan-white surface (Figure 7). Histologic examination revealed multiple regions of cystic degeneration, positive staining for S100, and Antoni A and Antoni B areas. The final pathologic diagnoses were renal oncocytoma and left paraaortic ancient, benign schwannoma.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 45-year-old male patient was referred to the prosthodontics clinic to complete the restoration of a dental implant (3.7 mmx11 mm, Zimmer implant, Standard Plus, regular neck, Zimmer Dental, Carlsbad, CA, USA), at the site of tooth #21. The dentist had placed an implant 3 months previously and then started the construction process of a cement-retained crown for restoring implant #21 and fabricated a gold customized implant abutment. Before completion of the implant restoration, the patient was referred to our clinic to continue the treatment.\\nDuring the first visit, patient medical and dental history was reviewed. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system, the patient is ASA1. The patient's chief complaint was to continue the treatment of his anterior teeth. Upon smiling, the patient has a low to average smile line. The apparent teeth have a homogenous shade that the patient was satisfied with. Intraoral examination revealed adequate periodontal health, tooth #11 had a provisional crown, and tooth #21 is an implant with a healing abutment. The patient has thin gingival biotype. Radiographic examination displayed the current process of external root resorption for tooth #11. The patient was provided with complete information regarding treatment options to make a decision for tooth extraction and implant placement of #11 (Figure 1). The patient signed an informed consent to proceed with the treatment plan. \\nThe cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image for the patient displayed sufficient sound buccal, lingual, and apical alveolar bone around tooth #11. A surgical guide was developed as a duplicate for the prior master cast for the prosthodontist with self-cure acrylic resin. The surgeon was guided through predetermined mesiodistal and buccolingual center channel for tooth extraction #11 in the patient's mouth. The implant mount attachment was facilitated with the help of an acrylic transfer jig to assure the cast fabrication for quick succession to fabricate the fixed dental prosthesis after placing an implant. In addition, the vacuum-formed template for provisional restoration fabrication was used for fabricating a 1.5 mm thermoplastic material.\\nThe surgical process was performed by the periodontist by giving local anesthesia to the patient. Tooth #11 was removed by performing flapless and atraumatic extraction, followed by normal socket saline rinsing, debridement, and curettage. In addition, during implant drilling, the mouth of the patient was secured through the teeth-supported surgical guide. By using the standard protocols for the Zimmer system, implant placement and bone preparation were performed in the patient's mouth. The placement and torquing of a Zimmer implant were ensured at 40 N cm (Figure 2). In contrast, there was no essential requirement made by the dentist toward soft tissue suturing. \\nAfter the implant placement, the transfer jig was secured on the adjacent teeth and the implant mount was carefully connected to the jig by adding autopolymerizing acrylic resin. The implant mount was retrieved from the patient mouth with the attached jig, screwed to an implant lab analog and then transferred to the cast. Two implant temporary abutments from Zimmer (Zimmer Dental, Carlsbad, Calif) were placed on the cast and prepared using the clear vacuum-formed shell template (Figure 3). \\nThe implant supported fixed provisional restoration was constructed to develop the preferred emergence profile using acrylic resin. The provisional fixed dental prostheses were appropriately finished and polished.\\nThe temporary abutments were screwed to the implants in the patient's mouth, and Teflon tape was used to block both temporary abutments' access holes. Afterward, the minimum amount of non-eugenol temporary cement was used to cement the provisional restoration and excess cement was safely removed. Occlusion was adjusted to ensure minimal contacts during eccentric and centric occlusion (Figure 4). \\nPost-operative instruction was given to the patient and recall visits were done after 7 days, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks. On each follow-up appointment, the healing was assessed with no signs of inflammation or infection. Also, the development of the soft tissue emergence profile around the implant was monitored and the provisional restoration was adjusted if required. Esthetics and phonetics were evaluated and the patient displayed a complete satisfaction with the outcome (Figure 5). \\nA definitive open tray impression was done by using Impergum Penta-Soft after 4 months of healing (Figure 6). The customization of impression copings was based on the transference of the emergency profile of the soft tissue. The soft tissue emergence profile was transferred to the mastercast using light body polyvinyl siloxane material (Figure 7). \\nFull contour wax up was made for crowns #11 and 21 on the master cast. The clear vacuum-formed shell template was used to adjust the old gold custom abutment of implant #21. Afterward, mounted master casts, gold abutment #21, and the clear template were sent to Astra Tech (Molndal, Sweden) to design and fabricate a customized milled CAD/CAM Atlantis abutment. Abutment design of implant #11 was requested to match the design of gold abutment #21 except in material. The abutment designed for implant #11 was fabricated from zirconia for comparison purposes. An approval from the prosthodontists was taken via email for the abutment design (Figure 8). A one-piece customized abutment which consisted entirely of zirconia was milled and shipped to the clinic. \\nUpon arrival, both abutments were checked on the cast for exact duplication. Full contour acrylic resin crowns were constructed on both abutments to confirm the equal thickness of both crowns on all sections. Thickness evaluation was made using a polygauge and all the readings were equal on both crowns in all sections (Figure 9). \\nNext, crowns with porcelain fused to zirconia were constructed for implant abutments #11 and #21. Again, the buccal thicknesses of the final crowns were measured and compared using a polygauge. All readings were comparable for both crowns (Table 1). Afterward, abutments were screwed to both implants and final crowns were checked in the patient's mouth to evaluate esthetics and phonetics. Shade evaluation of both crowns was carried out by the treating prosthodontist on their buccal surfaces (incisor, middle, and cervical thirds) using VITA Easyshade Advance System (VITA Zahnfabrik, H. Rauter GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Sackingen, Germany). All readings were comparable in relation to CIE L*a*b* color space, Classical Vita Shade Guide and 3D Master Shade Guide. The shades of both crowns were comparable and rated clinically satisfactory by the treating prosthodontist and patient. Finally, customized abutments were torqued to 30 N cm, access hale were blocked with Teflon tape, and the final crowns were cemented with non-eugenol temporary cement (Temp Bond NE, Kerr; Orange, CA, USA) (Figure 10).  \\nTwo experts in fixed prosthodontics who had not taken part in the patients' treatment performed the clinical evaluation. Both observers had good eyesight that will assist in comparing the esthetic appearance of both implants supported all-ceramic crowns with gold and zirconia abutment side by side. Variations were detected using artificial diffuse light and the Vita 3D Master shade guide by standing 50 cm from the mouth of the patient where the head of the patient was positioned upright. There was no difference observed in the color aspect by prosthodontics.\\nThe recall visits were done after 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year from delivery of final restorations. Both implants and their restorations were assessed. The patient was satisfied with the esthetics and functional outcome of the final restorations, as was the prosthodontist (Figure 11). A written informed consent has been provided by the patient to have the case details and accompanying images published. The institution allows publication of the patient's treatment and images for scientific purposes.\",\n",

He had suffered from poliomyelitis in his childhood, which was followed by a flexion contracture of both the hips and knees. He underwent operations to release the flexion contracture of his hips and knees approximately 40 years ago and could walk well with calipers and crutches. The preoperative muscle power in his right and left lower limbs was Grade 0 and 1, respectively. Wide tumor excision, marginal mandibulectomy, and left supraomohyoid neck dissection were performed, resulting in a through-and-through left buccal defect. An ALT-free flap that included a portion of the vastus lateralis muscle was harvested from his right lower limb to reconstruct the buccal defect. The skin island measured 20 x 10 cm and included two cutaneous perforators (Figure 4). The descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral vessels were anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion to the left superior thyroid artery and two comitant veins. The donor site was resurfaced using a split-thickness skin graft that was harvested from the right medial thigh. Arterial vasospasm occurred intraoperatively and was subdued using 2% xylocaine irrigation. The flap became pink in color, and the capillary refill returned to a normal level (Figure 5). Post-operatively, intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 was prescribed to promote skin flap blood flow. The flap survived, and the patient's post-operative course after 17 days of hospitalization was uneventful. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient was satisfied with the reconstructed cheek and there were no donor site complications. The muscle power in the right lower limb remained at Grade 0 and he could walk well with calipers and crutches (Figure 6).\\nA line was drawn between the anterior superior iliac spine and superolateral corner of the patella, and a longitudinal skin incision of approximately 3-4 cm was medially made using normal procedures. A skin incision down to and through the thigh fascia will expose the rectus femoris in the normal lower limb but may encounter the vastus medialis muscle in a patient with poliomyelitis because of significant muscle atrophy. The quadriceps muscle had a pale, yellowish, fat-like color (Figure 4), and the intermuscular septum was not clear. Inexperienced surgeons may mistake the vastus medialis muscle for the rectus femoris muscle. In a patient who has had poliomyelitis, a lateral 1-2 cm subfascial dissection is required to clearly identify the rectus femoris muscle. Following identification, the dissection proceeded along a subfascial plane laterally toward the intermuscular septum between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles. Medial retraction of the rectus femoris muscle revealed the vascular pedicle with a descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral vessels. In our experience, the diameter of the vascular pedicle is less than 1 mm and smaller in patients with a history of poliomyelitis compared with patients without a history of poliomyelitis. The thigh skin was then raised and laterally retracted by a subfascial plane dissection, exposing the septocutaneous and/or musculocutaneous perforators. The number and size of cutaneous perforators were similar to normal ambulating limbs. Distal to proximal intramuscular dissection of the musculocutaneous perforator was then initiated. The intramuscular dissection was easier and more rapid than in a normal limb because there were fewer vastus lateralis muscle branches and less muscle bleeding. The distal end of the descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral vessels was ligated, and a thigh fasciocutaneous or myocutaneous ALT flap was well prepared for harvesting.\\nOn pathological examination of the paralytic limbs in Case 2, the thigh skin tissue revealed chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. As expected, the evaluation of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed degeneration and fibrosis (Figure 7).\",\n",

Her visual disturbance was more prominent in the left eye and worsened upon standing. She also experienced headaches, dizziness, weakness in the left extremities, and jaw claudication while chewing. Two years prior to presentation, she had noted diminished left radial pulse. There was no contributory family history. She had been diagnosed with Type 5 TA 1 month prior to our ophthalmology clinic and received two courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) with a 4-week interval followed by oral prednisone.\\nAt presentation, general physical examination disclosed the absence of left radial arterial pulses, along with feeble arterial pulses on her right side. Carotid and subclavian bruits were heard on both sides. Her blood pressure was 145/71 mmHg in the lower extremities. Ocular examination revealed a decimal best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.02 and 0.4 in the right and left eyes. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 6.3 mmHg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination showed that anterior segment was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed mildly distended veins in both eyes ( Figure 1 ).\\nFFA of the left eye showed delayed choroidal filling, leading edge of fluorescein dye in the arteries, prolonged arm-to-retina circulation time of 38 s, and arteriovenous transit time of 32 s. Diffuse microaneurysms were noted in the midperipheral area. In the late phase, retinal vessels were markedly stained. Similar changes were detected in the right eye. There was no evidence of capillary non-perfusion, arteriovenous shunts, or retinal neovascularization ( Figure 2 ). Spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) did not detect any significant macular changes. OCTA showed extreme rarefaction of perifoveal vascular density at the level of superficial capillary plexus (SCP) ( Figures 3A, G ) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) ( Figures 3D, J ) in both eyes. Disruption of the perifoveal vascular arcade was also noted predominately in DCP.\\nBlood testing on admission revealed normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (8.0 mm/h), C-reactive protein (2.40 mg/L), and moderate eosinophilia (7,460 cells/mul). Chemical profile, liver and renal function, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were normal. On vascular imaging, a carotid Doppler showed diffuse wall thickening with associated luminal stenosis involving bilateral common carotid arteries and subclavian arteries. High-grade stenosis of the bilateral proximal subclavian artery was noted. Marked luminal narrowing was seen in the right tibial artery in a peripheral ultrasound. A subsequent CT angiogram (CTA) disclosed circumferential thickening of thoracic aorta, complete occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries, and critical stenosis of bilateral proximal subclavian arteries ( Figure 4 ).\\nBased on the patient's past history of TA, ocular symptoms, and relevant eye examinations, stage II TR was diagnosed according to the Umaya and Asayma classification. She was referred to a vascular surgeon and underwent balloon angioplasty of bilateral subclavian arteries. During the procedure, dilation of bilateral subclavian arteries was carried out with a 4 x 40 mm balloon through right femoral artery approach. Post-angioplasty angiogram showed markedly improved flow of pre-vertebral subclavian artery, predominately in the left side. She was put on prednisone (40 mg/day), CTX (50 mg/day), aspirin, and vasodilators afterward to induce remission in TA.\\nOne month after surgery, the patient reported a slight improvement in her vision. Her blood pressure is 72/55 mmHg in the upper extremities. FFA revealed improved retinal blood flow, with a persistent number of microaneurysms and late-phase dye leakage in both eyes. Paralleled to FFA findings, OCTA showed considerably increased vascular density in the SCP ( Figures 3B, H ) and DCP layer ( Figures 3E, K ). She remained on tapered prednisone (35 mg/day), CTX (50 mg/day), vasodilator (40 mug twice daily), and aspirin.\\nOn follow-up of 6 months, she continued to sustain good improvement in symptoms. Her BCVA improved to 0.6 in the right eye and remained stable at 0.4 in the left eye. IOP was 9 mmHg in both eyes. A fundus examination revealed a superficial hemorrhage in the peripheral retina of the left eye. Repeated FFA of the left eye showed a decrease of arm-to-retina circulation time and arteriovenous transit time to 16 and 8 s, respectively. The number of microaneurysms decreased, with less evident dye leakage in the midperipheral area. Right eye angiogram showed similar improvement ( Figure 5 ). No capillary non-perfusion and retinal neovascularization were observed. Notably, OCTA revealed further normalization of vascular density, along with restoration of perifoveal anastomotic capillary arcade ( Figures 3C, F, I, L ). CTA revealed moderate restoration of flow in the bilateral common carotid arteries and subclavian arteries.\",\n",

He had no remarkable past medical history or family history of metabolic bone disease. Roentgenographic examination revealed a deficiency of mineralization like that seen in rickets patients in the epiphysis of the bilateral proximal tibias and distal femurs ( Figure 1A ), and a radiolucent lesion with endosteal scalloping and marginal sclerosing in the left fibula ( Figure 1B ). Blood examination revealed a low serum phosphorus level of 2.3 mg/dL (reference range: 3.0-4.7 mg/dL), and a markedly high serum FGF23 level of 329 pg/mL (reference range: <50 pg/mL), and so we suspected PMT with TIO caused by the tumor-like lesion in the left fibula.\\nWe resected the tumor en bloc by preserving the periosteum of the fibula after confirming its benignity by intraoperative frozen section diagnosis, and the cavity of the tumor was filled with beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) ( Figure 1C  and  Supplemental Figure 1 ). The muscle weakness gradually improved, and the gait disturbance normalized within two months. In the postoperative 21-month follow-up, he had no symptoms, and hypophosphatemia was not detected. Roentgenographic examination revealed absorption of the beta-TCP and bone formation and union of the fibular shaft ( Figure 1D ).\\nHistopathological examination of the resected tumor revealed irregularly deposited osteoid and osteoblast-like tumor cells scattered between the osteoid and reactive osteoclastic giant cells ( Figure 1E  and  Supplemental Figure 2 ). In immunohistochemistry, expression of FGF23 was shown in the cytoplasm of the osteoblast-like tumor cells ( Figure 1F ), CD56 was diffusely positive on the cell membrane of the tumor cells and SATB2 was diffusely positive on the tumor cells ( Supplemental Figure 2 ).\\nAfter resecting the tumor, the serum FGF23 level started to decrease immediately and normalized within 3 hours ( Figure 1G ). It was also within the normal range five days after surgery. The increase in serum phosphorus level was slightly delayed as compared with that of the FGF23 level, and was observed 6 days after the operation ( Figure 1H ).\\nWe performed RNA sequencing using a resected specimen from the patient and identified a novel in-frame fusion involving NIPBL (encoding Nipped-B gene product and fungal Scc2-type sister chromatid cohesion proteins) and BEND2 (encoding a protein which has two BEN domains in the C-terminus) ( Figure 2A ). The fusion protein contained the phosphorylation site derived from NIPBL and the BEN domain derived from BEND2 ( Figure 2B ). Whole-exome sequencing identified three point mutations (IFT172:NM_015662:exon3:c.A263G:p.N88S; VAF = 0.22, GAB2:NM_080491:exon6:c.A1409G:p.D470G; VAF = 0.15, and PRKCH : NM_006255:exon14:c.A1996T:p.I666F; VAF = 0.17), none of which\\nwere reported as driver mutations. In polymerase chain reaction, the amplification of target regions containing breakpoint of the chromosomal structure was confirmed using two primer sets in tumor DNA of the PMT ( Supplemental Figure 3 ).\\nWe cloned and transfected the NIPBL-BEND2 fusion gene to HEK293T and MG63 osteoblast lineage cell line. The NIPBL-BEND2 transfected cells showed faster proliferation at 48 hours after transfection (p = 0.001 and 0.003, Student's t-test, respectively). ( Figures 2C, D ). A gene set enrichment analysis of the fusion gene-introduced HEK293T cells identified a significant enrichment of MYC-target genes, consistent with faster proliferation ( Figure 2E ). However, the expression of FGF23 (log2 fold change; 0.031) and FGFR1 (log 2 fold change; 1.59) was not changed significantly by the transfection in addition to the KL/KLB, SPP1, SFRP4, and MEPE ( Supplemental Data 1 ), even though the tumor mRNA showed relatively high FPKM in these genes ( Supplemental Table 3 ).\",\n",

He noticed a swelling in the lower jaw in the posterior region, which was initially small in size and gradually increased to the present size. It was initially painless, but the patient now complains of mild intermittent pain, occasionally. The patient was prescribed antibiotics and analgesics by a general practitioner 3-4 times in the last 9 months.\\nExtraoral examination revealed a solitary swelling in the left mandibular ramus area. The swelling was roughly oval in shape with approximate size of 2 cm x 3 cm. The margins of the swelling were diffuse. The skin overlying the swelling was smooth and normal in color (Figure 1).\\nOn palpation, temperature of overlying skin of swelling was slightly elevated. The consistency of the swelling was bony hard. Medio-lateral expansion of the cortical plates was noted at angle of mandible. A single left submandibular lymph node of size approximately 1 to 1.5 cm was noted, which was slightly tender and mobile.\\nIntraoral examination revealed a single small swelling in retromolar area, slightly obliterating the pterygopalatine raphe. Expansion of buccal and lingual cortical plate was noted. A deep periodontal pocket was noted distal to 37 (Figure 2).\\nProvisional diagnosis on clinical examination was made as benign odontogenic lesion. Differential diagnosis of ameloblastoma, odontogenic keratocyst, dentigerous cyst associated with 38, calcifying odontogenic cyst, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, and ameloblastic fibroma was considered.\\nRadiographic examination of the lesion showed a well-defined unilocular radiolucency involving the left side of the mandible which extended anteroposteriorly from the distal surface of the left mandibular second molar to the posterior border of ramus of mandible and superoinferiorly from coronoid notch to the inferior border of mandible. It showed well corticated borders. Resorption of the distal surface of root of the mandibular second molar was also noted (Figure 3).\\nCT and 3D CT scan of the lesion showed a unilocular osteolytic lesion in the posterior part of body and ramus of the mandible. Bilateral cortical plate expansion was noted. Perforation of the lingual cortical plate was also revealed (Figures 4 and 5). Radiologic examination showed that mandibular left third molar was absent. So the possibility of \"dentigerous cyst associated with 38\" which was considered in the provisional diagnosis was ruled out.\\nRoutine hemogram was performed and all the blood indices were within normal limits. An incisional biopsy was then performed, which on histopathologic examination revealed a cystic cavity lined by odontogenic epithelium and a connective tissue capsule. Epithelium shows palisaded basal layer resembling ameloblast-like cells and a superficial layer showing stellate reticulum-like cells. The connective tissue was dense, fibrous with collagen fibers arranged haphazardly. Numerous engorged and dilated blood vessels were seen (Figure 6).\\nFrom the above clinicopathological features, a diagnosis of unicystic ameloblastoma was made. The patient then underwent a mandibular segmental resection involving condyle and reconstruction was done with 2.7 mm titanium reconstruction plate and iliac crest graft, under general anesthesia. Healing was uneventful. Patient was followed up after 1 month with radiographic evaluation which showed complete healing of wounds and well maintained graft (Figure 7).\\nWe received a segmental resected specimen involving condyle, coronoid process, upto ascending ramus, which showed perforation in the anterior border of ascending ramus. Histopathological examination of the excisional biopsy specimen showed lesional tissue that consisted of a cystic cavity lined by odontogenic epithelium and connective tissue capsule. The epithelium showed cuboidal or columnar basal cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, nuclear palisading with polarization, cytoplasmic vacuolization with intercellular spacing, and subepithelial hyalinization and superficial layer showing stellate reticulum-like cells. There was also proliferation of these cells in cystic lumen in a plexiform pattern. The cells are arranged in interconnecting strands and cords with peripheral palisaded layer and central stellate reticulum-like cells (Figure 9). Tissue material resembling an odontogenic keratocyst lining was not observed, even with serial sections of tissue. So possibility of ameloblastic transformation of odontogenic keratocyst was also excluded.\\nAccording to the classification suggested by Ackermann et al., it was classified as unicystic ameloblastoma subgroup 1.2 which is also known as plexiform unicystic ameloblastoma.',\n",

Macroscopically, the tumor was mulberry-shaped, purplish in color, and well demarcated, but tightly adhered to a nerve root of the cauda equina [Figure 2]. Intraoperative monitoring (e.g. somatosensory and motor evoked potentials) indicated that the involved nerve root innervated the anal sphincter and adduction of the toe.

The patient reported that she could not perceive any foetal movements, but denied any history of recent trauma or per vaginal bleeding. She was hypotensive (blood pressure 70/40 mmHg) with a normal heart rate and was immediately fluid resuscitated.\\nOn examination, the patient had a diffusely tender abdomen with cold, clammy peripheries. The obstetric assessment showed no signs of labour, closed cervix and absent foetal heart sounds. An artificial rupture of membranes was performed that showed clear liquid. Bedside obstetric ultrasound performed in the emergency room confirmed the absence of foetal heart activity and movements. A provisional diagnosis of placental abruption with foetal demise was made. The stillborn baby and placenta were delivered vaginally 6 h later.\\nA few hours postpartum, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain similar to the pain earlier in the day. The patient was noted to become hypotensive and tachycardic, with generalized abdominal distension and tenderness. Full blood count analysis revealed a significant drop in haemoglobin and platelets but normal coagulation profile.\\nThe patient was transferred to the high dependency care unit and was transfused three units of packed red cells and two units of platelets. Bedside ultrasound was performed that showed free fluid around the liver. Spontaneous rupture of the liver was suspected and a non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen was performed that showed haemorrhagic fluid around the liver, which was intact. Clinically, the patient continued to show signs of bleeding over the next few hours, with low haemoglobin levels on repeat analysis despite the transfusion. However, she remained haemodynamically stable with mild tachycardia.\\nThe obstetric team sought the advice of the on-call interventional radiologist to explore the possibility of embolization in view of the suspected diagnosis of ruptured liver. A CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis was advised as the initial investigation to localize the bleeding site, as the patient remained clinically stable. This revealed a focal dilatation of the ascending segment of the right uterine artery measuring 6 mm, suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm and extensive haemoperitoneum within the abdomen and pelvis (Figures 1 and 2). Following discussion between the gynaecologists and the interventional radiologist, the patient was transferred immediately within the next hour to the interventional suite. A pelvic angiogram was performed followed by selective bilateral uterine arteriograms. A right uterine artery pseudoaneurysm was demonstrated on the right iliac angiogram (Figure 3) corresponding to the CT angiogram findings with no active bleeding. A selective right uterine artery angiogram demonstrated active contrast extravasation, which was probably owing to the disruption of the clot surrounding the pseudoaneurysm due to the pressure from the contrast injection directly into the mid-uterine artery as opposed to the non-selective earlier angiograms (Figure 4). Immediate embolization of the uterine artery proximal to the pseudoaneurysm was performed using fibred platinum coils (035\" 5 mm x 4.5 mm VortX  35, Boston Scientific Corporation, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The final angiogram showed no evidence of the previously demonstrated pseudoaneurysm or bleeding and stasis of flow in the right uterine artery (Figure 5). Subsequently, the patient remained haemodynamically stable and asymptomatic with no evidence of further bleeding and was transferred back to the maternity unit for grievance counselling. Histology of the placenta confirmed an intact placenta with no evidence of abruption and findings compatible with foetal demise within 24 h prior to delivery.

The mother was welcomed, held the newborn in her arms, and received the comfort of the team's words in her language of understanding. On her lap, the newborn remained for about 90 minutes, when the mother then requested the opportunity to change the newborn's diaper. Faced with such a simple request, which resulted in the diaper changed by the mother, the multiprofessional team could see the great significance of such apparently small attitudes. There were several benefits brought by this practice, among them answering a last request from a grieving mother, humanizing the moment of death, and bringing a new look to issues that are so difficult to be addressed - since this practice was innovative in the NICU.\\nBecause family and religion are two entities that can help in the grieving process, the parents were offered the possibility of the team contacting other family members, but the parents chose to conduct the communication with the grandparents. Regarding the possibility of counseling or religious ceremony, the parents refused such support.( )\\nFollowing the protocol of the event, the newborn would be transferred to the morgue, where it would remain until transportation for the wake and burial. However, knowing that culturally, in her country of origin, the mother would take her newborn to be mourned at home and only then be sent to the cemetery, the team understood the mother's request to keep her son wrapped in her scarf and in her arms until the removal to the wake, allowing the newborn and mother to be safe and accompanied until the moment of transfer - which is hospital standard - and enabling the mother's aspiration to remain with her son as long as desired.\",\n",

He was first found to have thyroid dysfunction at another hospital 17 months before admission and was referred to our hospital for investigation of the cause of thyroid dysfunction. On admission, his body temperature was 36.8 C, blood pressure was 136/78 mmHg, and heart rate was 82 bpm. Physical examination revealed no exophthalmos, finger tremors, skin wetness, or goiter. After the diagnosis of FDH, the patient's mother was also found to have FDH.\\nSerum TSH, FT4, FT3, total thyroxine (TT4), and total triiodothyronine (TT3) levels were measured using automated immunoassay systems (Architect from Abbott Diagnostics, Elecsys  from Roche Diagnostics, or Lumipulse  from Fujirebio). Laboratory data on admission revealed SITSH (Table 1). Negative results were obtained for TSH receptor antibody, thyroid-stimulating antibody, antithyroglobulin antibody, and antithyroid peroxidase antibody. The three-hour thyroid I-123 uptake value was 6.2%, which was within the normal range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed no tumor, and blood flow and thyroid size were both normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland revealed no tumor (Fig. 1). Based on these investigations, we considered that SITSH might be due to RTH, but ruled out TSH-secreting pituitary tumor. Then, a genomic DNA sample was obtained for clinical diagnosis, after receiving informed consent. However, genomic DNA sequencing of exons 4-10 of the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta) gene showed no mutation. Therefore, we investigated the possibility of albumin gene mutations. Direct genomic sequencing of exon 7 of the albumin gene revealed a substitution of cytosine (C) for guanine (G) in the second nucleotide of codon 218 in one of the two alleles, leading to the replacement of arginine by proline (Fig. 2). Therefore, we diagnosed FDH caused by R218P heterozygous point mutation.\",\n",

The symptom of malaise disappeared spontaneously over time, but serum thyroid function tests remained unchanged. The symptom of malaise was therefore considered unrelated to thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid hormone data from admission to 18 months after admission are shown in Table 2. Serum TT4 concentration was markedly increased, but serum TT3 concentration was only slightly elevated. We evaluated the effect of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation test in the serum of FDH patients as previously reported. The results of PEG precipitation testing in FDH patients and healthy controls were almost the same (Table 3). Therefore, the possible effect of anti-triiodothyronine antibody or anti-thyroxine antibody was denied, but the PEG precipitation test was not able to reveal the exact value of FT4 in the serum of FDH patients. Thyroid hormone levels measured by Architect, Elecsys , and Lumipulse  systems 21 months after admission are shown in Table 4. Thyroid hormone levels measured by Architect and Elecsys  showed similar results and suggested SITSH-like laboratory findings, but those measured by Lumipulse  showed almost normal ranges of FT4 and FT3 levels.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The index patient was a 9-year-old boy (Figure 2, II-3), corrected for myopia since 3 years of age, who always had difficulty watching television and reading. He never complained of night blindness, peripheral vision loss, and dyschromatopsia, but he had moderate photophobia and wore photochromic glasses. The disease course seemed not progressive. Visual acuity was 20/30 in both eyes with -1.75(-2.25)40  oculus dexter (OD) and -6.25(-1.50)5  oculus sinister (OS). The anterior segments were normal, and the lenses were transparent. The fundus showed a moderate overall depigmentation, absence of the foveal reflex with a slight narrowing of the retinal vessels, and moderate pallor of the optic disc but no atrophy or pigment deposits, which was also confirmed with infrared reflectance images (Figure 3A,B). The retinal autofluorescence images were almost normal except a moderate perifoveal hyperautofluorescence (Figure 3C). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a normal peripheral retina, but we noted bilaterally moderate macular thinning with the ellipsoid zone moderately decreased in the thickness in the temporal part of the fovea (Figure 3D). Color vision testing with Lanthony D-15 HUE color tests showed a bilateral moderate blue-yellow axis of color confusion (not shown). In mixed kinetic and static perimetry, the peripheral isopter IIIc was normal on each side, 90  in temporal and 45  in nasal, but there was a medium decrease in the retinal sensitivity of the central 30 , including in the macular area (Figure 3E). On the ISCEV ERG, the amplitude of the scotopic responses was normal (Figure 3F). However, the photopic responses to a single flash were reduced and showed a moderate electronegative aspect. The 30 Hz flicker responses were reduced to about 30% of the normal value. In the oscillatory potentials (OP), OP1 was absent; in the others, OPs were present but diminished in amplitude (not shown). Due to the reduced photopic responses, the decreased visual acuity, presence of myopia, no obvious disease progression, and absence of night blindness, it was concluded that the patient had an atypical type of icCSNB. Although the name incomplete CSNB is misleading, patients with this disease often reveal the absence of night blindness. Two older sisters had no particular visual difficulties. His parents, both unaffected, were second cousins of Swiss origin. There was no history of this disease in the family. Therefore, the patient was an isolated case, which, given the parental consanguinity, suggested an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. X-linked heredity could not be excluded, but as the mother had five unaffected brothers, this mode of inheritance was not supported.\\nMutation screening showed that none of the known genes underlying icCSNB and the other CSNB candidate genes presented any disease-causing variant. Therefore, WES was performed for the trio, and sequence filtration isolated 15 putative variants (Appendix 1) from 194 insertions/deletions (InDels) and 1,597 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), as the splice-site mutation in intron 3 of the TTLL5 gene, c.182-3_182-1delinsAA (Appendix 2) selected for further cosegregation studies. For all subjects, the overall sequencing coverage of the captured regions was 92% and 88% for 10X and 25X depth of coverage, respectively, resulting in a mean sequencing depth of 109X per base (Appendix 3). Both unaffected parents were found to be heterozygous for this variant, at 40% and 48% in the mother and father, respectively, and the proband was homozygous for this variant, at 99%. The sequencing depth at this position was 132X and 124X in the mother and father, respectively, and 141X for the proband (Appendix 2). This c.182-3_182-1delinsAA mutation in TTLL5 was validated in the index patient and the unaffected parents with direct Sanger sequencing (Figure 2).',\n",

The patient was referred from a district hospital with an IOFB in the right eye. He received an injection of anti-tetanus serum at initial admission. \\nThe general examination was within normal limits. An ophthalmological examination was conducted; best corrected visual acuity (VA) was 6/5 in each eye, ocular motility was full in all directions, and digital intraocular pressures were normal for both eyes. The anterior segment of the right eye showed a hyperemic conjunctiva with a nail lodged at the temporal limbus (Figure 1 (Fig. 1)). Corneal edema was present, but other anterior segment findings were normal (round pupil, no synechiae or lens opacities, and anterior chamber formed with no flare or cells). The anterior segment of the left eye was within normal limits. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye revealed clear media with a visible foreign body (nail) in the vitreous, a round and sharp border of the optic disc, a flat retina, and good foveal reflex. The posterior segment of the left eye was within normal limits. \\nThe patient was diagnosed with an IOFB in the right eye. His treatment plan included intravenous cefotaxime injection (1 g) twice daily and hourly ofloxacin eye drop for the right eye in addition to being scheduled for IOFB extraction and intravitreal antibiotic (IVAB) injection. \\nUltrasonography examination showed an IOFB located in the limbus/pars plana that had penetrated into the vitreous cavity and posterior segment inflammation (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)).\\nThe surgery was performed 6 hours after administered. The nail was lodged at the limbus (9 o'clock) and had penetrated into the vitreous cavity, contacting the edge of the lens. It was removed with forceps, and measured 9 mm in length. Anterior vitrectomy and vitreous tap were then performed around the wound and the vitreous contents were subjected to Gram staining and culture. The wound was sutured, and vancomycin (1 mg) and amikacin (0.2 mg) were injected intravitreally. The patient was also given oral paracetamol (500 mg) three times daily and prednisolone acetate eye drops six times daily for the right eye. \\nOn the first postoperative day, the uncorrected VA for the right eye was count fingers. Anterior segment examination showed a closed wound and two in-place sutures at the temporal limbus (Figure 3 (Fig. 3)). Corneal edema, a hyperemic conjunctiva, subconjunctival bleeding, and a moderate depth anterior chamber with inflammation were noted. As before, the pupil was round and no synechiae or lens opacities were observed. The posterior segment examination revealed clear media, a normal optic disc, a flat retina, and macular edema with decreased foveal reflex. Gram stain of the vitreous tap revealed the presence of Gram-positive cocci, while the KOH stain was negative. The previous therapies were continued with the addition of 48 mg of methyl prednisolone orally once a day. \\nAngiographic examination of the right eye revealed hypofluorescence in the arteriovenous phase due to a vascular filling defect at the macula. Angiographic examination of the left eye was within normal limits. Based on the angiogram results, we diagnosed macular ischemia of the right eye (Figure 4 (Fig. 4)).\\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) examination of the right eye revealed increased retinal thickness with reduced intraretinal reflectivity, although the signal strength was ambiguous. OCT examination of the left eye was within normal limits (Figure 5 (Fig. 5)).\\nThree days after surgery, the uncorrected VA of the right eye was still count fingers, although there was a decrease in subconjunctival bleeding, corneal edema, and anterior chamber inflammation. The posterior segment examination continued to show macular edema. Previous therapies were continued with the addition of oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg) twice daily.

The pain was localized to the right shoulder without any weakness, numbness, or associated neck pain. The pain was worse after any activity involving the use of the right shoulder. The patient also reported that the pain occurred at night and disturbed her sleep. She recalled an injury during a scuba diving session five years earlier when she dove into the sea in an awkward position, hitting the water with her right shoulder. The pain began at this point, but it was not severe enough for her to seek medical attention. The pain was affecting her more frequently and with worsening intensity in the year and a half prior to coming to our orthopedic clinic.\\nOn physical examination, no obvious deformity, swelling, or erythema of the shoulder was observed. Active forward flexion of the right shoulder was from 0  to 130  and abduction was from 0  to 150 . The range of movement was limited because of pain and not weakness. All special tests for the shoulder yielded negative results.\\nA plain radiograph did not show any abnormalities, and MRI was subsequently ordered. MRI showed a subchondral bone cyst at the glenoid fossa (Figure 1). Preoperatively, a supplementary CT scan was also obtained (Figure 2).\\nDiagnostic arthroscopy of the left shoulder was done through surgical exploration. The patient was placed in a beach chair position under general anesthesia. The surgery started with a diagnostic scope of her right shoulder. The diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a loose body measuring about 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm, which was identified as a piece of cartilage detached from the defect area (Figure 3), and a defect over the glenoid fossa at the lower anterior quadrant measuring 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm (Figure 4). The surgery was then converted to open surgery using the deltopectoral approach, and the cyst was curetted (Figure 5) and packed with an autologous bone graft (Figure 6) harvested from the left iliac crest. Postoperatively, the patient wore a slingshot shoulder brace and had complete immobilization of the right shoulder for two weeks. After two weeks, she was instructed to do a one-plane range of movement over the shoulder, which involved forward flexion and extension. Six weeks postoperatively, the patient was instructed to start doing full range of motion of the right shoulder. Immediately post-surgery, the patient reported that she did not have any resting pain or night pain.\\nHistopathology examination of the tissue sample revealed a combination of benign tissue composed of bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue.\\nThe patient was followed up regularly in our clinic postoperatively, and she has not experienced any pain since the surgery. She has a full range of movement for the shoulder after completing physiotherapy. An MRI of the shoulder was repeated six months postoperatively and showed that a callus had formed at the location of the cyst (Figure 7).',\n",

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed patchy peripheral bibasilar ground glass opacities in both lungs, findings compatible with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 1). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab. Favipravir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and piperacillin/tazobactam were initiated. IVIG 400 mg/kg was administered.

       "    'case_text': \"Patient 1: A 9-year-old girl had presented at the age of 3.5 years with fever, cutaneous vasculitis and myalgia. Biological analyses demonstrated inflammation on both C reactive protein (CRP) (100 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (40 mm), elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA 1/800), a transient lupus anticoagulant, low IgM and IgA level, mild CD19 B cells, CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) lymphopenia. Nailfold capillaroscopy showed no vessels due to a severe vasculitis. Muscle testing was abnormal with a predominant proximal muscle weakness. The creatine kinase level was normal. Muscle MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed inflammatory lesions of the limbs (figure 1A). Muscle biopsy identified focal necrotising angiitis compatible with periarteritis nodosa.\\nAt the age of 5 years, she had presented with two episodes of severe vertigo, vomiting and encephalopathy. Cerebral MRI was normal, but a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was identified (16 lymphocytes/mm3). Clinical symptoms and vertigo improved on 2 mg/kg of prednisone. Following steroid treatment withdrawal, a cutaneous vasculitis appeared, necessitating the introduction of cyclosporine. The patient then developed an ileitis and cyclosporine was switched to azathioprine.\\nAt the age of 7 years, a period of 2 months of persistent headache had been followed by an encephalopathy and, a few weeks later, despite the increase of steroids, by left internuclear ophthalmoplaegia. Cerebral MRI with diffusion was again reported as normal. Treatment was changed to cyclophosphamide, but the patient then developed ataxia with right body hemiparesis, left facial paresis and aphasia, 2 months later. MRI showed gadolinium-enhancing lesions with subtle abnormality diffusion sequences suggestive of a vascular stroke (figure 1B), which was later confirmed by their evolution into lacunar lesions a few months later (figure 1C). During follow-up, the patient developed moderate hypertension. Despite immunosuppressive therapy, her pyramidal syndrome worsened and systemic inflammation persisted. After switching to anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy (etanercept), the biological abnormalities resolved, with no further evidence of disease activity 1 year later. The recent MRI showed the occurrence of another asymptomatic lacunar lesion of the internal capsule (figure 1C).\\nPatient 2: The younger sister had been followed for uncharacterised microcytic anaemia since the age of 1 year, with a mild inflammatory syndrome of unknown origin. IgM and IgA levels were low, with mild CD19 B lymphopenia. ANA was positive (1/200). The patient had neither cutaneous, visceral nor muscle signs, nor fever. At the age of 3 years, she presented with a transient paralysis of the right extrinsic third cranial nerve, with persistent systemic inflammation. Cerebral MRI with diffusion sequences and CSF were normal. At the age of 5 years she presented again, with transient gait disturbance, unexplained fever and mild biological inflammation. A provisional diagnosis of viral vestibulitis was made. Cerebral MRI showed a 2 mm lacunar stroke of the internal capsule. CSF was again normal. Treatment with anti-TNF was started, associated with a rapid normalisation of the inflammation and no other symptoms over the following year.\\nCECR1 sequencing revealed a heterozygous c.1358A>G; p.Tyr453Cys mutation in both siblings (figure 2A). This variant is predicted to be pathogenic by in silico analysis, and has been described previously. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR revealed a heterozygous deletion of exon 7 (c.973-?_1081+?del; p.Val325Thrfs*7), predicted to lead to a frameshift and truncated protein in both children (figure 2B). Parental analysis (father's genotype: c.[973-?_1081+?del];[=]; mother's genotype: c.[1358A>G];[=]) confirmed that the sisters were compound heterozygous for these two lesions.\\nADA2 activity was measured on two occasions and was consistently reduced to 50% of wild-type levels in both children (figure 2C).\\nIFN and neutrophil signatures were evaluated in unstimulated patient cells from whole blood samples. The expression of a panel of IFN-stimulated genes was significantly elevated in both patients (figure 3A), though for the older sister the second sampling showed no elevation of IFN-stimulated genes.\\nNeutrophil-stimulated genes were not overexpressed (figure 3B). The expression of a panel of other cytokine transcripts was not significantly altered (see online supplementary figure S1).\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 37-year-old male patient was referred to our center by his general practitioner who had incidentally found a 3.8-cm mass in the right adrenal area on computed tomography (CT) scan. The indication for a thoracic CT scan was suspicion of chronic pulmonary lesions or pulmonary embolism after a previous history of COVID-19 infection 3 months prior. Six months before the COVID-19 infection, the patient had complained of dizziness as well as chronic fatigue and profuse sweating with accentuation of symptomology over the summer of 2020 ( Figure 1 ).\\nThe patient had no history of hypertension and no previous complaints. In December 2020, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after presenting with typical symptoms, such as persistent cough, as well as headaches, concentration difficulties, and severe fatigue. He also complained further of profuse sweating and general weakness on a daily basis. He denied any medication or drug intake. On the thoracic CT scan, a right inhomogeneous adrenal mass was identified. An abdominal MRI confirmed the right inhomogeneous mass, presenting no signal loss on out-of-phase imaging, findings that raised the suspicion of a catecholamine-producing tumor ( Figure 2 ). Biochemical diagnosis revealed a raised concentration of plasma normetanephrine, and the patient was referred to our endocrine clinic for further investigation.\\nClinical examination on referral to our center revealed a well-oriented, afebrile patient with normal body weight (BMI 25 kg/m2). His blood pressure was 118/74 mmHg with a pulse rate of 84/min. Cardiac examination revealed rapid but normal heart sounds with no murmurs. Abdominal examination was unremarkable.\\nA 24-h blood pressure monitoring revealed normal values (122/81 mmHg daytime and 118/75 mmHg over the night). Biochemical evaluation further documented normal renal and thyroid function with normal glycemia. Hepatic enzymes were increased 2-fold. There was no evidence of hypercortisolism (morning cortisol = 402 nmol/L, ACTH 4.3 pmol/L) or primary aldosteronism (aldosterone/renin ratio 39, N < 52). The plasma concentration of normetanephrine, at 731 pg/ml, showed a more than 5-fold increase above the age-specific upper cutoff for this metabolite, while metanephrine was 30 pg/ml (N < 84 pg/ml), clearly indicating a noradrenergic PCC.\\nPreoperative preparation with phenoxybenzamine was initiated followed by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with bisoprolol. Right retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy was performed under general anesthesia. The patient showed an uncomplicated postoperative course and was referred to the surgical ward after 24 h of ICU monitoring. Blood pressure was stable and all antihypertensive treatment was terminated.\\nHistopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a 4.0 x 3.6 x 2.8 cm PCC, expressing synaptophysin and chromogranin, S100-positive cells, and SDHB positivity with a mitosis rate of 1/10 HPF/2.4 mm2 with the absence of atypical mitoses. The Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled Score (PASS) was 0, indicating a very low risk of malignancy.\\nPostoperatively, the patient complained of right facial paresthesia as well as inguinal pain and hypoesthesia of the ventral side of the right limb and, to a less extent, on the left limb. Neurologic examination could not identify any deficits. Cerebral MRI excluded acute events such as hemorrhage or stroke ( Figure 3 ). Completeness of resection was confirmed by normalized results of plasma normetanephrine (84 pg/ml) at 1-month follow-up after surgery. Next-generation sequencing revealed no mutations in over 20 known tumor susceptibility genes, either at the somatic or germline level, including the most prominent genes such as SDHX, RET, and VHL. Postsurgical normalization of plasma normetanephrine, together with the absence of genetic mutation as well as a PASS of 0, led to no further suspicion of metastatic disease. The profuse sweating as well as the dizziness was resolved within the next 6 months after the right adrenalectomy, while the pain, hypoesthesia, and headaches remained. The patient still complained of fatigue, headaches, and loss of concentration within the next months after adrenalectomy but to a more reduced degree than previously experienced. Further neurologic examination showed again no abnormalities aside from hypoesthesia of the ventral side of the right lower limb. The lumbar MRI showed broad-based subligamentous disc protrusion L5-S1 and a slight compression of the sciatic nerve. The inguinal pain was more severe when walking, suggesting degenerative changes in the sacroiliac joint. In the pelvic MRI, there was evidence of a rheumatic inflammatory genesis with slight edema ventrocaudal at the sacroiliac joint.',\n",

She was intubated secondary to obtundation and inability to protect her airways. Her neurological status began to stabilize within four days, but her ICU course was complicated by failed extubation trials.\\nAfter initially being intubated for a period of 10 days, she failed extubation and was reintubated twice due to stridor and increased respiratory effort. The otolaryngology head and neck service performed laryngoscopy which revealed pyriform sinuses with copious secretions, erythematous and edematous arytenoids, mildly edematous vocal cords with a shallow ulcer, and bilateral vocal cord paresis with 2 mm glottic gap. She was given dexamethasone 24 mg for 24 h and a 3-day course of methylprednisone. Three days later, the patient was taken to the OR for placement of a tracheostomy tube. Fibrinoid material was seen along the posterior glottis and palpation of vocal processes showed them to be immobile. Biopsies taken during the procedure revealed ulcerative herpes laryngitis with pathology showing large multinucleated cells with atypia under the ulcerated epithelium (Fig. 1), and strong positive HSV immunostaining (Fig. 2). Patient was started on a two-week treatment course of acyclovir 5 mg/kg IV every 8 h, similar to successful regimens in reported literature.

Ten days after the onset of the initial symptoms, he developed conjunctival injection of his right eye with associated epiphora, foreign body sensation and intermittent blurring of vision. He had recently returned from overseas where he had engaged in unprotected anal and oral sex with other men. Past medical history included depression and regular medications were duloxetine and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. A recent sexually transmitted infection screen was negative.

It was associated with shortness of breath, dizziness and sweating, but the patient denied loss of consciousness, cough, palpitation or swelling of the extremities. He denied any use of illicit substances. A week prior to this hospitalization he presented to the hospital with a similar complaint. At that time, chest pain was relieved by 325mg dose Aspirin taken orally; troponin was normal and EKG did not show any significant change from baseline.

No evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was observed.\\nTo detect antigen in the secondary patient's serum, the immunoprecipitation procedure was used. Patient's serum sample and sera from known C-CHF-positive patients, as well as hyperimmune human gamma globulin against C-CHFV, were placed in the wells in agar plates and left overnight to diffuse; precipitin lines were formed where the concentration of the antigen and antibodies was serologically equivalent.\\nWe extracted viral RNA from serum and whole blood samples from both patients. Complementary DNA was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using primers from the small (S) RNA segment of C-CHFV. We found a specific 260-bp band in both cases. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed by using the OpenGene automated DNA sequencing system (Visible Genetics Inc., Toronto, Canada). As expected, the two sequences were identical. We compared the resulting sequences with those available in the GenBank database using the BLAST tool (available from: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). We observed a similarity to C-CHFV S segment sequences.\\nSince strong evidence exists that ribavirin is effective for treating C-CHF, oral ribavirin was given to the second patient (800 mg three times on day 1, followed by 600 mg three times a day for the next 11 days). He responded successfully and, after 48 hours, became afebrile; his hematologic and biochemical parameters returned to normal. No side effects of ribavirin were present.

All contact persons in the hospital were informed and advised to contact a physician if any symptoms occurred. No additional persons became ill. Samples taken from the driver and the nurse who transferred the woman from the local hospital to Belgrade were tested by IFA for the presence of antibodies to C-CHFV and were found negative, even a month after the woman's death.\\nWhole blood of both C-CHF cases (10% suspension in phosphate-buffered saline) was injected separately into 25-mL flasks containing Vero E6 cells. The cells were checked for C-CHFV antigen by immunofluorescence assay with hyperimmune human globulin against C-CHFV (strain Hodja). Positive cells were detected in both flasks on the 6th day after injection. The supernatant of the cells was used to infect fresh E6 cultures, and the virus was passaged six further times. We designated the virus from the fatal C-CHF case as C-CHFV/Kosovo/9553/2001, and the virus from the infected physician as C-CHFV/Kosovo/9717/2001.\\nExtraction of viral RNA of cell culture supernatants, amplification, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the obtained sequences were identical to each other and to the sequences amplified from the clinical samples. The nucleotide sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers AF428144 (for the index case) and AF428145 (for the secondary case).

Historically, he was not known to be immunocompromised and had no close contact with a case of tuberculosis.\\nOn physical examination, he was fully alert and conscious and could actively participate in a conversation. His vital signs were as follows: temperature: 37.9C, heart rate: 86 beats/min, blood pressure: 100/70 mm/Hg, and respiratory rate: 18 breaths/min. In general, he seemed well. Thoracic and abdominal examinations were completely normal, respiratory and cardiac sound were normal and jugular venous pressure was not raised, nor was any lymphadenopathy detected. On the examination of the anus, anal erythema and swelling as well as discharge near the site of surgery were observed.\\nStandard blood tests are shown in Table 1. A PPD was negative. He was found be HIV antibody positive as well as anti hepatitis C positive. Chest X-ray did not reveal any abnormalities and the CT of the chest was also negative. The CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast revealed thickening of the rectum (Fig. 1). A colonoscopy revealed grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, many small aphthous ulcers in the rectum and normal sigmoid and descending colon (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). An AFB stain of the ulcers was negative. The biopsy showed chronic granulomatous proctitis (Fig. 4). Staining was positive for acid fast bacilli. The patient was then begun on standard four drug therapy for TB. The cultures for TB were positive and his symptoms and lesions healed.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 13-year-old female spayed domestic shorthair (DSH) cat was presented for polyphagia, polyuria and polydipsia (PUPD) and weight loss (day 1). The cat weighed 4.3 kg (body condition score 4/9) and had lost 1 kg in body weight over the previous 6 months. A grade II/VI left parasternal systolic murmur was auscultated, the haircoat was unkempt with a heavy flea burden and the abdomen appeared mildly pendulous. Six weeks previously, the cat had presented with pollakiuria and polydipsia. Bacterial cystitis due to Escherichia coli was diagnosed and pollakiuria resolved after a single dose of cefovecin subcutaneously (8 mg/kg) (Convenia; Zoetis). At that time, there was mild azotaemia (creatinine 187 micromol/l and urea 11.46 mmol/l; reference intervals [RIs] 90-180 micromol/l and 7.2-10.7 mmol/l, respectively) and hypokalaemia (3.1 mmol/l; RI 4.0-4.6 mmol/l), and urine specific gravity (USG) was 1.014.\\nHaematology results on day 1 were within the RIs. Abnormalities on serum biochemistry included hypokalaemia (3.1 mmol/l; RI 3.7-5.4 mmol/l), metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate 25 mmol/l; RI 12-24 mmol/l) and elevated creatinine kinase (CK; 5569 IU/l [RI 64-400 IU/l]). Urea (9.1 mmol/l; RI 5.0-15.0 mmol/l), creatinine (110 micromol/l; RI 80-200 micromol/l) and symmetrical dimethylarginine (8 microg/dl; RI 0-14) were not elevated. Primary hyperaldosteronism was suspected owing to the presence of PUPD, weight loss, persistent hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis and elevated CK. Further investigation, including systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP) measurement, abdominal ultrasonography and plasma aldosterone:renin measurement were recommended.\\nTwo days later (day 3), the cat re-presented with marked cervical ventroflexion and was mildly dehydrated (body weight 4.23 kg). SABP (Doppler method) was 150 mmHg and fundoscopy was unremarkable. On urinalysis, USG was 1.015 and urine sediment was benign. Blood was collected for basal aldosterone, progesterone and renin assays. On abdominal ultrasonography the right adrenal gland was enlarged, rounded and discrete (19 mm diameter) (Figure 1). The left adrenal gland appeared normal (cranial pole height 3.4 mm, caudal pole height 3.5 mm, length 11 mm).\\nThe cat was hospitalised (day 3) and treatment was commenced with spironolactone (6.25 mg PO q24h) and potassium gluconate (4 mmol PO q12h). Intravenous fluid therapy (IVFT) was not administered owing to financial constraints and the cat ate on admission to hospital. However, on day 4, weakness and dehydration worsened (body weight 4.1 kg). Despite a stable packed cell volume (PCV; 0.30 l/l [RI 0.30-0.45]), total serum protein (TSP) increased (90 g/l; RI 39-78 g/l), hypernatremia developed (167 mmol/l; RI 147-156 mmol/l) and hypokalaemia worsened (2.9 mmol/l; RI 4.0-4.6 mmol/l). SABP was also elevated at 180 mmHg. Crystalloid IVFT (Hartmann's solution) at 13 ml/h and potassium chloride (KCl) at 0.4 mmol/kg/h IV was commenced. Spironolactone was continued and potassium gluconate was increased to 4 mmol PO q4h. After 4 h, potassium was 3.9 mmol/l and KCl supplementation was reduced to 0.13 mmol/kg/h IV.\\nOn day 5 body weight had increased by 400 g, and the cat became tachycardic (heart rate 260 beats/min) and tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 60 breaths/min). Initially, fluid overload was suspected. However, on physical examination several hours later mucous membranes were pale, PCV (0.13 l/l) and TSP (52 g/l) had decreased markedly, and SABP was 150 mmHg. Serum potassium was 3.6 mmol/l and sodium was 160 mmol/l. Acute haemorrhage from the adrenal mass was suspected. Repeat abdominal ultrasonography revealed a new 5 cm diameter heterogeneous area, in the right retroperitoneal space adjacent to the enlarged right adrenal gland (17 mm diameter). Free fluid was also present in the right retroperitoneal space, and there was scant free fluid between liver lobes. These findings were consistent with a periadrenal haematoma and haemorrhage into the retroperitoneal space and peritoneal cavity. Possible causes were considered to be rupture of the mass or neoplastic invasion of adrenal vessels with erosion of the vessel wall. There was no evidence of coagulopathy - prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and platelet count were within the RIs.\\nBlood typing was performed (Quick Test; Alvedia Veterinary Diagnostics) and the cat was blood type B, for which no immediate donor was available. Supportive therapy with IVFT, KCl and spironolactone were continued, and the flea burden was treated with nitenpyram 11.4 mg PO (Capstar; Novartis), then topical imidacloprid (Advocate; Bayer). From days 6 to 8 the cat was clinically stable, cervical ventroflexion resolved, polyphagia returned, SABP ranged from 110-140 mmHg, PCV and TSP increased to 17 l/l and 75 g/l, respectively, and the median serum potassium was 3.8 mmol/l.\\nResults of endocrine testing confirmed hyperaldosteronism and hyperprogesteronism; plasma aldosterone was 38,100 pmol/l (RI 60-980 pmol/l), plasma renin activity was 422 fmol/l/s (RI 130-2350 fmol/l/s) and the aldosterone:renin ratio was markedly increased (69.9; RI 0.4-1.5). Basal progesterone was also elevated (30.6 nmol/l; RI <2.0 nmol/l).\\nOn day 8, a blood type B donor was sourced, and 52.5 ml of whole blood was administered preoperatively. On day 9, preoperative PCV was 0.28 l/l, potassium was 3.8 mmol/l, sodium was 153 mmol/l and SABP was 145 mmHg. CT of the abdomen and thorax was performed under general anaesthesia. There was ventral displacement and compression of the caudal vena cava by the right adrenal mass and no evidence of vena caval invasion or tumour thrombi. There was a large, localised right retroperitoneal effusion with marked mass effect and no evidence of abdominal or thoracic metastases (Figure 1). At surgery to remove the right adrenal gland (Figure 1), via a ventral midline approach, a haematoma (45 mm diameter) was observed in close proximity to the right adrenal gland, just ventral to the caudal vena cava.\\nAnalgesia consisted of a ketamine constant rate infusion (CRI; 0.5 mg/kg/h IV) and methadone (0.1 mg/kg IV q4h). A hydrocortisone CRI (0.5 mg/kg/h) was administered to manage a potentially hypofunctional left adrenal. Within 8 h postoperatively the cat was eating, and serum potassium was 4.2 mmol/l. On day 11, spironolactone, hydrocortisone and IVFT were ceased and oral prednisolone (1.25 mg q24h) was prescribed until day 50. On day 14 PCV was 0.26 l/l and TSP was 74 g/l. Oral potassium was tapered and ceased on day 15. No further electrolyte abnormalities were documented. The cat was discharged from hospital on day 16.\\nHistopathology revealed an adrenal adenocarcinoma (ACC) with no evidence of vascular invasion. The periphery of the mass was necrotic and considered the likely site of the haemorrhage. There was no haemorrhage within the tumour.\\nAt rechecks 5 weeks postoperatively body weight, gait, posture, vital signs and serum potassium were normal, and anaemia had resolved. At a recheck 8 months postoperatively the cat was reported to be in good health by the owner, body weight was stable (4.3 kg) and SABP was 160 mmHg, but International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) was diagnosed (urea 10.01 mmol/l [RI 7.2-10.7 mmol/l], creatinine 181 micromol/l [RI 90-180 micromol/l], USG 1.018).\",\n",

The cat vocalised continuously after the event, and appeared to be in pain when picked up by its owner, a veterinary nurse. The cat had a history of polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss for several months beforehand.\\nOn clinical examination, the cat was hypothermic (37.0 C), tachycardic and had pale mucous membranes. The cat was stabilised with crystalloid IVFT overnight. On presentation at referral several days later the cat had a body condition score of 3/9, pale mucous membranes and was tachycardic with a IV/VI parasternal systolic heart murmur, SABP of 220 mmHg and normal fundoscopy. Abnormalities on haematology and biochemistry included a PCV of 18 l/l, TSP of 59 g/l, serum potassium of 2.17 mmol/l (RI 3.7-5.4 mmol/l), creatinine 468 micromol/l (RI 9-190 micromol/l) and a USG of 1.021. Plasma sodium was within the RI (149 mmol/l; RI 144-157 mmol/l). Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of an irregular, large right adrenal mass, which measured 5 x 2.7 cm diameter at the largest dimension and displaced the caudal vena cava to the right side. Partial attenuation of the caudal vena cava was assessed to be a consequence of haematoma formation at the site of the adrenal mass, although invasion of the caudal vena cava could not be excluded. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable.\\nSpironolactone (6.25 mg PO q24h) and amlodipine (1.25 mg PO q24h) were commenced. Serum aldosterone was elevated (1916 pmol/l; RI 60-980 pmol/l), renin activity was 0 fmol/l/s; RI 130-2350 fmol/l/s), and a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism was confirmed. An exploratory ventral midline celiotomy was performed 1 week later. The cat was blood typed (type A [Rapid-H; DSM Laboratories]) and given a 50 ml type A blood transfusion preoperatively. At surgery the right adrenal mass was adherent to, but not invading, the vena cava. A right adrenalectomy was performed. The adrenal mass contained a large amount of intratumoral haemorrhage and necrosis on cut section (Figure 2). Histological examination confirmed an ACC arising from the zona glomerulosa with extensive intratumoral necrosis and haemorrhage. The cat recovered well postoperatively.\\nAt a recheck examination 9 months later, the PCV was 32 l/l, TSP was 75 g/l and the cat was diagnosed with IRIS stage 3 CKD.

She was previously diagnosed with FMD after presenting to the emergency room 12 years prior with a headache and left-sided paresis and was found to have a right internal carotid dissection and right middle cerebral artery occlusion. A four-vessel arteriogram of the head demonstrated multifocal narrowing of the right vertebral artery consistent with a diagnosis of FMD. Renal ultrasound and MRA did not show involvement of the renal vasculature. Her severe hypertension was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and monitored by her primary care provider. One week prior to presentation to ophthalmology, the patient was found to be mildly hypertensive to 144/80. Three weeks prior to presentation to our ophthalmology clinic, the patient had been seen by an outside provider who documented elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) of 34 mmHg and 26 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively.

Extraocular movements and confrontational fields were normal. Pupillary response was sluggish, but no afferent pupillary defect was noted. Her anterior segment exam was normal. Dilated fundus exam of the right eye revealed disc edema, flame hemorrhages radiating from the optic disc extending into the midperiphery, diffuse dot-blot hemorrhages, and tortuous, engorged retinal veins (Fig.1). Fluorescein angiography identified delayed arterial filling and late optic disc staining (Fig.2). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed intraretinal cysts and subretinal fluid with distortion of the foveal contour (Fig.3).

She later had a right extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for a residual stones 2 years ago. CT scan of the kidneys showed non-obstructing bilateral renal calculi along with cholelithiasis in the gall bladder. Patient also had multiple gastroenterology clinic visits with the complaints of postprandial bloating and recurrent oral ulcers. Bone densitometry showed marked osteopenia. Her serum calcium level was found elevated at 12.6 mg/dl. The constellation of her symptoms and the elevated calcium levels warranted further workup. Serum PTH was 403 pg/ml (16-87) and serum phosphorus was 2.2 mg/dl (2.5-4.5) respectively; she was diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism, aka, PTH dependent hyperparathyroidism causing malignant hypercalcemia. In order, to rule out the possibility of parathyroid adenoma, a high resolution CT scan of chest and neck where carried out, but, there was no abnormal enlargement of the parathyroid gland present, however, 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy scan was done that showed a well defined area of abnormal tracer deposition in anterior mediastinum just below the manubriosternal junction confirming the diagnosis of mediastinal ectopic PA, furthermore, parathyroid adenomas were outlined over lower pole of right thyroid in anterior mediastinum as well.

The detailed descriptions of each case are provided in the Supplementary Materials, and the characteristics are displayed in Supplementary Table 1.\\nAs shown in Table 1, the median age of patients was 62.5 (55.0-73.0) years old. Half of the cases were male. Four (40%) patients were diagnosed with lung cancer and 2 patients were diagnosed with thymoma. Other cancer types included cervical cancer, pyriform sinus squamous cell carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, one patient diagnosed with cervical cancer had a previous history of breast cancer, and one patient with lung adenocarcinoma was once diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Before ICI treatment, 70% of the patients were treated with surgeries, and 80% had received chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was performed on 60% of the patients, and two (20%) patients also received angiogenesis inhibitors. Only two patients were found to have previous cardiovascular disease, one was diagnosed with hypertension and the other was diagnosed with coronary heart disease.\\nThe most frequent ICIs treatment for the cases were sintilimab (30%) and camrelizumab (30%). Nine patients were treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, while the remaining one received anti-PD-L1 therapy. Median time from the use of the first dose of ICI to onset was 28.5 (17.8-63.5) days and symptoms at onset varied markedly. The most common symptoms presented in our cases were chest tightness, which occurred in 50% of the patients. Palpitations and fatigue were presented in 30% of the patients. Neuromuscular symptoms also occurred in ICI-related cardiac irAE. Forty percentage of the patients presented with blepharoptosis, one patient showed diplopia and one patient developed conscious disturbance during the disease.\\nBased on the diagnosing criteria proposed by Marc P. Bonaca et al., only two patients were classified as having definite myocarditis. Six cases were classified as other myocardial injury and two patients were regarded as having possible myocarditis, mainly due to the lack of confirmed examinations such as coronary angiography to rule out acute coronary syndrome. Sixty percentage of the patients were mild cases classified as G1-2.\\nLaboratory, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram findings for the patients with cardiac irAE were shown in Table 2. Lymphopenia was frequently found in the cardiac irAE (7, 70%). The elevated level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was observed in six (60%) and nine (90%) patients, respectively. Markedly evaluated levels of creatinine kinase (CK), creatinine kinase-muscle and brain type (CK-MB), and troponin I (TnI) were found in nine (90%) patients. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) tests were available in eight patients, and levels were significantly elevated in four (50%) of them. The serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an important biomarker in systemic inflammation, were available in five patients, and CRP levels were elevated in four (80%). Four heart-specific autoantibodies were measured in two patients (Case 1 and 4, see Supplementary Material 1) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and both of their serum samples were positive.\\n12-lead ECG and transthoracic echocardiography were performed in all cases. Cardiac conduction disorders including atrioventricular block (AVB) and bundle branch block were found in seven (70%) patients. One patient presented I-II AVB, which eventually progressed to complete AVB (case 1, Supplementary Material 1).

He had demonstrated a decreased appetite and an about 70- to 80-pound weight loss in the preceding 2 months. His medical history was also significant for atrial fibrillation, left ventricular thrombus, and cerebral aneurysm with prior intraventricular hemorrhage. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history, a history of chronic alcoholism for over 40 years, and prior cocaine and marijuana use. He denied any family history of cancer. His physical examination was notable for abdominal distention and mild epigastric tenderness, but his abdomen was soft and he had normoactive bowel sounds. He had no hepatosplenomegaly and his examination was otherwise unremarkable.\\nHis workup included laboratory tests, which showed normal serum amylase and lipase levels. Liver function tests revealed alkaline phosphatase at 172 U/l (normal = 30-165), alanine transaminase at 12 U/l (normal = 0-55), aspartate transaminase at 49 U/l (normal = 0-50), bilirubin at 1.3 mg/dl (normal = 0.2-1.2), and albumin at 2.8 g/dl (normal = 3.2-5.5). His other serum chemistries were normal. Serum tumor markers were obtained, which showed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) at 10,400 ng/ml (normal = <2.5 for nonsmokers, <5 for smokers), cancer antigen 125 at 358 U/ml (normal <35), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at 4,970 ng/ml (normal = <6.1). A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed a markedly dilated, debris-filled stomach with no contrast beyond the gastric antrum, and a mass-like density in the gastric antrum or proximal duodenum measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter (fig. 1a). Multiple hypodense hepatic lesions (the largest being 6 cm in the right hepatic lobe) were also seen, which was consistent with metastatic disease (fig. 1b).\\nThe patient subsequently underwent upper endoscopy, which showed distal esophageal varices and undigested food in the stomach. A circumferential, friable mass at the duodenal bulb was noted, obliterating 80% of the lumen and preventing scope advancement beyond the second portion of duodenum (fig. 2). Biopsies were obtained. He underwent colonoscopy as well, which was essentially normal. The gastric antrum biopsy showed mild chronic inactive gastritis, and the pyloric antral biopsy showed mild chronic active gastritis with foveolar hyperplasia; a Giemsa stain was negative for Helicobacter pylori. A biopsy of his duodenal mucosa showed mild chronic active inflammation of the lamina propria with no significant villus blunting. The biopsy of the visualized duodenal mass, however, showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with glandular formation, which was confirmed by mucin-positive staining. There were also areas with trabecular and nested patterns seen (fig. 3a). A comprehensive immunostain panel showed that the tumor cells were negative for Hep Par 1 and glypican-3, essentially ruling out hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for CEA, AFP, CK18, CK19, and CDX-2, but were negative for CK7, CK20, and synaptophysin (fig. 3b, c).\\nThe patient also underwent a CT-guided biopsy of his liver lesions, which showed invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with striking morphological and immunohistochemical similarity to the duodenal bulb mass biopsy, suggesting that the duodenal bulb was the most likely primary origin. Given the pathological and laboratory findings of adenocarcinoma of the duodenum with AFP-positive tumor staining and elevated serum AFP levels in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, he was diagnosed with stage IV HAC of the duodenum.\\nHis course subsequently was notable for pyloric stent placement to help relieve his gastric outlet obstruction. He unfortunately continued to have nausea and bilious vomiting despite stent placement, and required total parenteral nutrition. Chemotherapy was deferred due to his poor performance status (ECOG PS 4), and he was managed supportively. His hospital course was further complicated by septic shock due to Escherichia coli bacteremia and fungemia, acute hypoxic hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and loculated empyema. Unfortunately, he died from multiorgan failure within 1 month of his diagnosis.',\n",

He had no blasts in peripheral blood. Per chart review, we noted that he had started to develop neutrophilia and thrombocytosis in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was positive for both b2a2 and b3a2 transcripts at 2.1% and 1.2%, respectively. Imatinib was started. Eight weeks later, WBC count was 16.8 cells/mm3, hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL, platelet count 649/mm3, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction negative for BCR-ABL transcripts. The fact that the patient had complete molecular response without hematologic response triggered further workup. JAK2 V617F mutation was checked in peripheral blood and was positive. Erythropoietin was low at 1.3 mIU/mL. Examination of the bone marrow showed hypercellularity (90%) with myeloid/erythroid ratio of 7.7, proliferation of atypical megakaryocytes, <1% blasts, and widespread grade 2 reticulin fibrosis. No BCR-ABL translocation was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. DIPSS (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System) Plus score was 1.

Interestingly, when MPD preceded CML, the mean time interval between the diagnoses of the 2 entities was 10.6 years compared with 5.4 years when CML preceded MPD. Interaction between JAK2 mutation and BCR-ABL transcripts levels varies. In most cases, JAK2 and BCR-ABL levels moved in opposite directions. In the remaining cases, JAK2 level decreased or remained constant while BCR-ABL level decreased.',\n",

Physical examination revealed peripheral oxygen saturation < 90%, requiring supplemental oxygen. No infiltrates were found on the chest X-ray, despite a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab. Initial blood test results are shown in Table 1. During admission, he received treatment with hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support for 10 days, being discharged upon resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms. Two weeks later, he returned to the hospital, due to high unremittent daily fever up to 39 . No clear etiology was evident in the anamnesis, and the physical examination was unremarkable, excepting the fever. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated (meropenem, linezolid, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Blood cultures were negative on several occasions; cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus viral loads were undetectable; serologies for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetti, and Parvovirus B19 were negative; and Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) tested negative. However, SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive in the nasopharyngeal swab. Despite antibiotic treatment, daily fever persisted, and clinical and analytical parameters worsened presenting pancytopenia, organomegaly, and elevation of ferritin and cytokine profile (Table 1). A positron emission tomography performed was unremarkable. At that point, calculated Hscore score was 211, conferred a 93.65% probability of his clinical condition being caused by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Bone marrow examination was not obtained. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (1 g/Kg x 2 days) were started, with fever disappearance, hemodynamic improvement, and attenuation of acute phase reactants (Table 1).

       "    'case_text': \"Patient is a 26-year-old female with a past medical history of HIV. She was infected at age 15 and showed poor adherence to antiretroviral medication. She reported the combined use of Tenofovir, Emtricitabine, and Efavirenz intermittently, mostly because she did not seek adequate healthcare due to feelings of shame about being associated with the disease. She also missed most of her follow-ups in the last year, and had no CD4 counts or viral load tests performed in over 6 months. She also suffered from intermittent episodes of coughing, bloody stools, and weight loss during this time; however, she didn't seek any medical attention.\\nShe presented to our emergency room with a 10-day history of intermittent lower abdominal pain, nausea, biliary vomits and asthenia. Approximately 24 h prior to admittance, the pain became worse. On clinical examination, a dehydrated, hypotensive and tachycardic patient was encountered. Her abdomen was diffusely tender, and the pain became more intense on touch. Laboratory exams revealed mild leukocytosis and neutrophilia. An arterial gasometry revealed metabolic acidosis with hyperlactatemia.\\nIn view of these findings, surgical consultation was requested and a diagnosis of diffuse peritonitis was reached. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids was started and an emergency laparotomy was decided. At surgery, the peritoneal cavity was filled with 500 ml of pus and 2 bowel perforations were identified: a 1 x 1 cm perforation in the terminal ileum, 50 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, and a 3 x 2 cm perforation in the cecum (Fig. 1A-C).\\nA right colectomy was decided, however, the surgical team had doubts about restoring bowel continuity. Nonetheless, since the patient became stable after reanimation and surgery, restoration was considered feasible. Given the context of an HIV patient with poor controls who would be unlikely able to handle an ileostomy, a primary anastomosis with close surveillance was decided. Resection began 10 cm proximal to the ileal perforation and ended near the hepatic flexure of the colon. Then, a side-to-side ileotransverse anastomosis was performed with 75 mm staples (ETHICON Linear Cutter NTLC75, Johnson & Johnson). Extensive washing of the peritoneal cavity was completed and the remainder of the procedure was performed without complications. Based on the historical, clinical, and laboratory data obtained, we initially considered intestinal perforation due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection as the probable etiology of peritonitis, and the differentials included, mycobacterial infections, fungal infections, neoplastic disease or Kaposi sarcoma. However, definitive pathology tests for the cause of the perforation were delayed due to the unavailability of an in-house pathologist. Furthermore, other essential tests including CD4 counts and HIV viral loads and antibodies (both IgM and IgG) were not available at our institution.\\nThis situation was further complicated by the lack of resources from the patient and our hospital; nonetheless, we managed to send a blood sample to a nearby hospital for testing. Even under these harsh conditions, the patient had a good recovery. She was placed under broad-spectrum antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) and was given a 3-day cycle of Ganciclovir. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) was initiated as well. Meanwhile, sips of liquids were initiated on the second postoperative day without complications. She didn't have any episodes of fever, nausea, vomiting or signs of anastomosis leak.\\nAt the 7th postoperative day, the patient requested to leave against medical advice (AMA), she signed the hospital consents and left our facility.\\nTwo days after the patient went AMA, CD4 and HIV viral load results arrived along with the pathology report, revealing chronic inflammation of the resected bowel, and multiple ulcers affecting the mucosa of the ileum and the cecum. Also, multiple granulomas surrounded by inflammatory tissue were recognized, as well as some granulomas within the lymph nodes. Bowel perforation due to tuberculosis was confirmed as the final diagnosis, CD4 cell counts were estimated at 94 cells/mm3, and the viral load was estimated at over 106 genome copies (Fig. 2A-C).\\nSince tuberculosis in Ecuador is a mandatory declaration disease, we searched for the patient and found her in the coastal region of the country. Fortunately, she was stable and without complications. She was taken by the national healthcare system and admitted to a tertiary hospital for HIV and tuberculosis treatment.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'We present the case of a 55-year-old woman underwent bariatric surgery in 2014, after which she lost 55 kg of weight (Fig. 1). The patient did not have associated co-morbidities. Given the significant weight loss, with a stable body weight for about 1 year, the patient showed a common skin laxity, especially represented in the abdominal region. The cutaneous laxity of the abdominal region, with ptosis of the dermo-adipose tissues, classified the patient as a grade 3 according to Matarasso, also had a diastasis of the rectus muscles of the abdomen, with indication for surgical intervention. We decide to perform an abdominoplasty with transposition of umbilicus and strengthening of the rectus abdominis muscles by plication of the muscular fascia. Given our experience with patients undergoing bariatric surgery, we decided to perform an abdominoplasty with preservation of the Scarpa Fascia. In fact, this technique seems to have a positive impact on reducing seroma formation, reducing the amount of drained fluids and the drainage time. In our experience, patients undergoing massive weight loss show a greater tendency in the formation of seromas for which it is decided to conduct this procedure.\\nWe evaluated the following variables: age, BMI, comorbidity, drainage removal times, total volume of drained fluids, length of hospital stay. The follow-up was 18 months.\\nIn our clinical practice, we perform antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin 2 g iv 30 min before surgery. According to the literature the abdominal flap was sculpted in two different planes, superficial prefascial (above the Scarpa Fascia) in the infraumbilical region and preaneurotic region in the epigastric portion. The skin incision is made according to the preoperative design (Fig. 2), then the abdominal flap is sculpted with ultrasound scalpels. During this maneuver we prefer a manual traction of the flap taking care to preserve the Scarpa Fascia up to about 1 cm below the umbilical scar as described in the literature. Once this level is reached, dissection is carried out according to a premuscular (preaponeurotic) plane. The dissection up to the xiphoid process is confined to the area between the medial margins of the rectus abdominis muscles in order to preserve the perforating vessels of the upper abdomen. The trabecular ligament of the xyphoid process, in our case has been sectioned so the sliding of the abdominal flap is facilitated. Once the tunnel has been completed, the muscle fascia of the rectum is plicated with its approach in the upper abdominal portions, then a medial portion of the adipofascial tissue is removed and the premuscular plane is exposed (Fig. 3). Reposition of the umbilical scar approximately 2 cm above the projection on the abdominal flap. With the patient in semi-Fowler position the abdominal flap is approached at the suprapubic margin and positioning of 2 suction drains JP (Jackson Pratt). Sutures in 3 layers in latero-medial direction and dressing with steri-strip. The patient wore a compressive sheath for 40 days.

He received alemtuzumab 1 mg/kg total dose and total body irradiation (3 Gy) as conditioning, followed by peripheral blood stem cell infusion. Graft versus host-disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of sirolimus. The conditioning regimen was preceded by a 3 month long preconditioning phase with azathioprine 150 mg/day and hydroxyurea 25 mg/kg/day. In the months before HSCT, the patient developed a serious delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). In the past, the patient was diagnosed with anti-Jk(b) antibodies, which had disappeared at the time of the DHTR. However, new anti-Wr(a) antibodies and nonspecific cold auto-antibodies were detected at the time of DHTR. The patient was successfully treated with prednisolone and immunoglobulins. Subsequently, 3 weeks before a planned pre-transplant RBC exchange transfusion, he was treated with rituximab (375 mg/m2) to reduce the risk of another episode of DHTR. Blood group genotyping of the matched sibling donor was performed, which was positive for Jk(b) and negative for Wr(a). No antibodies to the donor's RBC antigens were present before the transplantation. After transplantation, rapid engraftment of leukocytes and platelets occurred. However, the patient remained anemic with profound reticulopenia, for which he needed regular RBC transfusions, receiving a total of seven RBC units before resolution of PRCA. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Donor myeloid chimerism was >95%, ruling out primary rejection of the allograft. A PCR for parvovirus B19 DNA was negative. Post-allogeneic HSCT isohemagglutinin titers remained present (IgG anti-B 1:32, IgM anti-B 1:8). No other RBC antibodies were detected at the time of the PRCA. Pure red cell aplasia was diagnosed and treatment with 4 weekly doses of daratumumab (1800 mg subcutaneously, fixed dose) was started on day +60 post-transplantation. Daratumumab was tolerated fairly well by the patient, besides an episode of fever grade 2 (CTCAE v.5) and headache grade 1 (CTCAE v.5), which occurred after the second dose. After 4 doses of daratumumab, prompt increases of hemoglobin and reticulocyte counts ( Figure 1 ) and the disappearance of anti-B isohemagglutinins were observed. Chimerism analysis 12 months post-transplantation showed stable donor myeloid chimerism (>95%) and 69% donor T-cell chimerism. Peripheral blood B-cell count had reconstituted to normal values (absolute count 0.104x109/L, 21.7% of lymphocytes). In the 12 months follow-up period after initiation of daratumumab to date, no transfusions or other immunosuppressive therapies have been necessary, and anti-B isohemagglutinins remain undetectable.\",\n",

The patient also gave history of occasional palpitations of same durations, and did not have any significant past history. Her physical and systemic examination was normal. The investigative profile of the patient revealed: hemoglobin of 12.7, platelets, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) with normal counts. Biochemical parameters like kidney and liver functions were normal. Echocardiography was normal but the x-ray chest parasternal axis view revealed cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large pericardial mass measuring 10.6 x 4.8 cms (Figure 1 & 2), honeycombed in appearance, compressing the right atrium and right ventricle, and was associated with moderate pericardial effusion. The possibility of hydatid pericardial cyst was made, but hydatid serology was negative. Ultrasonography of abdomen was also normal. She was then extensively worked up with all forms of imaging including contrast enhanced CT (CECT) chest and cardiac MRI (Figure 3). Her CECT thorax revealed isodense non-enhancing lesion in pericardial cavity with pericardial fluid. The CECT possibility of organized exudative collection was made, and pericardial tumor like mesothelioma/teratoma was less likely in view of non-enhancing lesion. Cardiac MRI shows multicystic lesion in the right atrioventricular groove of heterogeneous hyperintense signal on T1 weighted images and bright signal on T2 weighted and gradient echo images with indistinct myocardial wall along the pericardial lesion. Lesion shows hypointense septae, and is compressing the right atrium and right ventricle.

The uncertainty of diagnosis was explained to the patient and her immediate family (husband and brother), and due to this uncertainty, no prognostication was performed. They understood the risk and consented for the operation. Finally she was subjected to surgery with surgical notes revealing the operative findings as pinkish brown mass covering the entire right ventricle on opening the pericardium. At no place did it feel hard and nodular, and was arising entirely from the right ventricular myocardium, and approximately 10 ml of clear straw colored fluid was aspirated from 2 cystic areas of the mass, and was sent for cytology and biochemistry.

The dog was adopted 7-months prior and the previous medical history was unknown. The owner reported that the dog exercised daily without limitation, lived indoors only, and had no history of trauma. The dog was fed a commercial kibble diet and not administered any medications or supplements. The physical examination, which included thorough neurologic, musculoskeletal, and cardiopulmonary evaluations, was unremarkable. A complete blood count, serum biochemistry, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and urinalysis were performed. Clinically relevant abnormalities on the serum biochemistry performed at that time included a severe hyperCKemia (15,137 IU/L; reference interval 10-200 IU/L), and moderate increases in alanine transaminase (ALT; [432 IU/L; reference interval 180-121 IU/L]) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; [404 IU/L; reference interval 16-55 IU/L]) enzyme activities. The complete blood count, SDMA, and urinalysis were unremarkable. A serum biochemical profile was repeated 7-days later, which revealed persistently increased serum CK activity (10,301 IU/L) as well as ALT (409 IU/L) and AST (290 IU/L) enzyme activities (Figure 1). Recommendations for additional diagnostic testing were declined by the owner in favor of empirical treatment for potential toxoplasmosis/neosporosis with clindamycin (22.7 mg/kg, PO, q12 h for 14 days).\\nThe dog was presented for evaluation on day 55. The owner reported no clinical changes in the dog and the physical examination remained unremarkable. A serum biochemistry was repeated and revealed relatively unchanged serum CK, ALT, and AST enzyme activities (Figure 1). A commercial ELISA-based kit (4DX SNAP Plus Test kit, IDEXX Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, ME) was negative for detection of antibodies for Ehrlichia sp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Borrelia burgdorferi C6 peptide, and Dirofilaria immitis antigen. Differential diagnoses considered by the primary care veterinarian at that time included infectious polymyositis (Toxoplasma gondii or Neospora canis [potentially resistant to clindamycin], Hepatozoon canis or americanum), immune-mediated polymyositis, paraneoplastic polymyositis, congenital myopathy, or a hereditary muscular dystrophic disorder. The following diagnostic tests were recommended; skeletal muscle biopsy, electromyogram (EMG), echocardiogram, serum antinuclear antibodies, and additional infectious disease testing. The owner declined these recommendations because the dog was subclinical and instead opted for an additional course of clindamycin (22.7 mg/kg, PO, q12 h for 30 days). The dog was presented for evaluation on day 97. Again, the owner reported no abnormalities and the dog had an unremarkable physical examination. A serum biochemistry revealed relatively unchanged serum CK, ALT, and AST enzyme activities (Figure 1). All additional diagnostic testing recommendations were declined and the dog was discharged without medications.\\nThe dog was presented to the primary care veterinarian for a wellness examination on day 602. The owner reported no abnormalities since the dog was last evaluated (day 97). The dog continued to exercise daily without limitation. Physical examination was unremarkable. There was no pain elicited with muscle palpation. A complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis were performed. The serum biochemistry revealed persistence in severe hyperCKemia and mild to moderate increases in ALT and AST enzyme activities (Figure 1). The complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable. The owner declined additional diagnostic tests or empirical therapies at that time because the dog did not demonstrate any clinical abnormalities.\\nThe dog was then presented to the Midwestern University Companion Animal Clinic (MWU-CAC) on day 1,036 for a second opinion regarding the severe hyperCKemia and mild-to-moderate increase in ALT and AST enzyme activities. The dog remained subclinical and exercised daily without limitation. A physical examination performed by a boarded small animal internist (JAJ) was unremarkable. The dog had a normal muscle conditioning score and pain was not elicited with deep palpation of musculature. A neurologic examination performed by a boarded neurologist (JE) revealed the dog was bright, alert and responsive. The dog was ambulatory with no signs of stilted gait, lameness or paresis. There was no overt exercise intolerance after several minutes of walking and trotting. Postural reactions, spinal reflexes and cranial nerves were normal. Serum biochemistry revealed an unchanged severe hyperCKemia and persistent mild-to-moderate derangements in ALT and AST enzyme activities (Figure 1). The dog was negative for detection of antibodies (IgM and IgG) for Toxoplasma gondii or Neospora canis (Protatek Reference Laboratory) and nucleic acids associated with Hepatozoon spp. (Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory) were not detected. An abdominal ultrasonogram performed by a boarded small animal internist (JAJ) trained in ultrasonography was unremarkable. Differential diagnoses considered at that time in order of likelihood was hereditary muscular dystrophy, and less likely necrotizing myopathy, generalized or focal inflammatory myopathy. Additional diagnostic tests including EMG, echocardiogram, or skeletal muscle biopsies were offered but declined by the owner.\\nThe dog was evaluated on day 1,516 at the MWU-CAC for a pre-anesthetic examination for a dental prophylactic procedure. The owner reported no abnormalities since the dog was last evaluated (day 1,036) and the physical examination remained unremarkable. The dog had no muscle loss and remained active at home. A serum biochemistry revealed an improved, but persistent moderate hyperCKemia and mild-to-moderate increase in ALT and AST enzyme activities (Figure 1). A complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable. Next, an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were performed by a boarded cardiologist (CP) in light of the persistent and unknown cause of severe hyperCKemia to ensure the dog did not have clinically relevant heart disease before undergoing anesthesia. Based on the echocardiographic findings, ACVIM Stage B1 degenerative valvular disease was detected, and demonstrated mild mitral and mild tricuspid regurgitation. The global systolic function appeared preserved. During the echocardiogram, Lead II electrocardiographic monitoring revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no evidence of ectopy.\\nThe last in-hospital recheck examination took place on day 1,807 (5 years from initial evaluation). The owner reported no clinical abnormalities and the physical examination was unremarkable (Supplementary Video). The neurological examination was again normal. A serum biochemistry revealed a moderate hyperCKemia (4,601 IU/L) and mild-to-moderate increases in ALT (225 IU/L) and AST (165 IU/L) enzyme activity (Figure 1). Electrophoretic identification of serum CK isoenzymes (Antech Diagnostics, Irvine, CA, USA) revealed that CK-MM was the predominant electrophoretic fraction (83.7%), followed by CK-MB (10.3%) and CK-BB (6.0%). No injections were administered to the dog at or near the time serum total CK was measured at any of the examination time-points.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'An 80-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after a fall. Her prior history was notable for coronary artery disease status post percutaneous intervention, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation. She had had multiple mechanical falls in the past with cervical spine and right-sided rib fractures. She had no recent hospitalization in the last 90 days and has been living at home prior to presentation. There was no history of exposure to the farm animals. During this hospitalization, she developed progressive dyspnea and hypoxia. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a bilateral pleural effusion, right more than left, with diffuse interlobular septal thickening. Note was also made of a diffuse, mosaic-like attenuation of the lung parenchyma, likely related to air trapping or obstructive small airway disease. There was no pleural enhancement, septations, or air noted within the pleural space (Figure 1(a)). She was noted to have new fracture of right posterior seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs. Laboratory data at admission revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.7 x 1000/microL (with 83% neutrophils and 1% eosinophils). Her hemoglobin was 11.09 g/dL, hematocrit 40.6%, platelets 143 x 1000/microL, total protein 5.1 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 31 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.51 mg/dL, serum sodium (Na) 145 mEq/L, chloride (Cl) 102 mEq/L, potassium (K) 3.6 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 24 IU/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 472 IU/L. Serum procalcitonin levels were elevated to 0.59 ng/mL (normal 0.00 - 0.08 ng/mL) and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) to 8.9%.\\nBlood cultures prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy returned negative. Sputum culture was negative for bacteria, including acid-fast bacilli. Transthoracic echocardiography was unremarkable.\\nThe patient was treated initially with levofloxacin and ampicillin/sulbactam for a pneumonia and parapneumonic pleural effusion. Despite antimicrobial therapy, her respiratory status continued to deteriorate and within 48 hours of hospitalization required endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support. A thoracentesis yielded 250 ml of pus (WBCs more than 50,000 with 95% neutrophils, elevated protein 3.6 g/dL (normal 0.0-2.4 g/dL), LDH 13461 IU/L, glucose 6 mg/dL, and pH 6.94). A right-sided thoracostomy was performed to facilitate evacuation of the empyema using a 32 French (F) thoracostomy tube. Postprocedure chest X-ray confirmed the optimal placement of the tube (Figure 2). Gram stains obtained from the pleural fluid collected under sterile conditions revealed gram-positive cocci, and her antibiotics were changed to vancomycin. The final isolate on culture and sensitivity was identified as S. simulans with heavy growth, susceptible to vancomycin and clindamycin only. A repeat CT scan of the chest revealed a persistent collection of right-sided empyema (Figure 1(b)). Ultrasound imaging of the pleural collections did not demonstrate any septations or loculated pockets on either side. Second attempt was made to evacuate the pleural collection with the use of intrapleural fibrinolytic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) with little success. The patient was considered a high-risk candidate for surgical intervention considering her frailty and other medical comorbidities. Her course was further complicated by circulatory shock requiring vasopressor supports and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring multiple rate-controlling drugs. After about 3 weeks of a tenuous course, her family elected to withdraw care and she passed away very shortly thereafter.',\n",

A 48-year-old white female presented for evaluation of possible laser vision correction.\\nDescriptions of her eye findings: 20/20 best corrected vision, normal intraocular pressure, simple myopia, normal cornea thickness, normal pupil size, and normal topography. The significant ocular findings: chronic bilateral optic disk edema for ten years.\\nIn the consideration for the selection of either PRK or LASIK as the procedure for this patient, it is necessary to search relevant evidences to support the decision.\\nPRK and LASIK are laser eye surgery procedures intended to correct a person\\'s vision to reduce dependency on glasses or contacts.\\nIn PRK, the surgeon removes the outer layer of epithelium with various techniques, then an excimer laser ablates and reshapes corneal tissue. Anesthetic drops are used to reduce pain. LASIK uses a microkeratome device or a femtosecond laser under suctioning to increase intraocular pressure to about 65 mmHg up to 100 mmHg for 45 second to cut epithelium and stroma to a thickness of 100-180 microns, and then, an excimer laser ablates corneal tissue under the epithelial/corneal tissue flap.\\nPRK is an excellent alternative when LASIK is not an option. It is suitable for those with less corneal tissue, because it can preserve more corneal tissue. There will be no complications of stromal flap in PRK. Unlike LASIK, it does not require pressure suction on the eye ball. Nevertheless, the drawbacks are more discomfort than LASIK in the first 24 hours after procedure, it requires more healing time than LASIK, trauma may cause complications after surgery, and long-term outcomes are not as well established as older corrective procedures such as LASIK.\\nLASIK is appropriate for people who have more corneal tissue. The benefits are less discomfort than PRK, almost no pain, 20/20 vision or better is typically achieved by the first day, corneal haze is very rare, immediate clear vision, and follow-up enhancements are easier if needed. However, the drawbacks are contraindicated with thinner corneas, flap may dislodge with trauma, increases higher-order aberrations (HOA), nonsmooth flap may lead to astigmatism, flap may result in scars, and postoperational treatment is needed in approximately 5% of patients.\\nA search strategy was developed to search evidence in the literature to support the decision in the selection of the better procedure for this patient.\\nPopulation: patients have sick optic nerve undergoing refractive laser surgery.\\nIntervention: PRK.\\nComparison: LASIK.\\nOutcome: no damage to optic nerve after procedure.\\nBoolean operators are the using of combining words and methods to search in electronic databases.

Pubmed had 83 articles, and none was selectedfrom Cochrane library review.\\nThere were three observational case reports and two experimental studies (see Tables 1 and 2).\\nLASIK-induced optic neuropathy by Cameron et al. clearly described the case of a subject with a previously normal optic nerve who developed bilateral optic neuropathy after LASIK surgery. The neuropathy manifested with visual field defects. Valid test such as complete eye exam with detailed evaluation of the optic nerve, detail medical history, stereodisc photographs, GDx nerve fiber analyzer, was used rigorously to confirm the diagnosis associated with LASIK pre-op and post-op. Other possible causes of optic neuropathy were also carefully ruled out. The author concluded that optic nerve neuropathy is a dangerous complication of LASIK. It may be due to barotrauma or ischemia from elevation of intraocular pressure by the suction ring during the LASIK procedure. Lee et al. and Montezuma et al. also reported similar cases with the same conclusion. Lee et al. even reported two cases that experienced chronic disc edema pre-op similar to this case pre-op. The two cases he reported had LASIK and suffered acute visual loss. Nevertheless, the experimental parallel control trial of Lester demonstrated no statistically significantly different measurement between before and after a compression of 100 mmHg to the eye for 45 second (as in suction ring pressure of LASIK procedure) in the mean RNFLT (retina nerve fiber layer thickness). This quantitative study showed that the acute increase in intraocular pressure during LASIK did not significantly change the thickness of retina nerve fiber layer in normal eyes. Furthermore, Hamada conducted a prospective consecutive study of 53 normal eyes to compare the RNFLT before LASIK and after LASIK. He concluded that transient extreme elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) during LASIK does not affect RNFLT in normal myopic eyes for at least one year after surgery.\\nThere were two case reports and one case series. Although these are poor-quality studies and rank near the bottom of hierarchy of evidence, these cases provide valuable insights and warning for potential sight-threatening conditions.\\nThe two experimental studies were appraised according to the CASP framework.\\nBoth studies have a clear focus:\\nP: patients undergoing refractive laser surgery\\nI: LASIK (will receive 100 mmHg of pressure for 45 seconds during the procedure) or 100 mmHg of pressure for 45 seconds.\\nO: change in RNFLT (retina nerve fiber layer thickness).\\nThese were not randomized trials but were prospective consecutive cases.\\nParticipants were appropriately allocated to intervention. The groups appeared equivalent (all normal eyes) and had low risk of selection bias with strong internal validity.\\nIt was not possible to \"blind\" due the nature of intervention. However, the outcome measures are objective that will reduce the threat to internal validity.\\nAll the participants in these two studies were accounted for at the conclusion. The follow-up rates were 100% that increase both the internal and external validity.\\nThe data collection and the follow-up were done in the same way. (This increases internal validity.)\\nThe power calculations were not mentioned in the either of the two studies. It is a decrease of external validity. However, Hamada\\'s.Study may have enough power with 53 participants for a single outcome measurement.\\nThe result showed no statistically difference in RNFLT (retina nerve fiber layer thickness) before and after the application of pressure (100 mmHg) to the normal eye ball during LASIK or for the experiment for 45 seconds in 2 minutes, one month, 7 month, and 13 month.\\nNo confidence interval was reported in the two studies.\\nThe internal and external validities were good in the studies for using locally.\\nSince glaucoma patients are contraindicated for LASIK surgery and it is a rare to see patients having sick optic disc desire laser refractive surgery, there are neither systematic reviews nor randomized control studies available as reference for this case. Furthermore, the alternative laser refractive procedure such as PRK is available for those suspicious cases; most surgeons will choose the alternative way to avoid catastrophic result.\\nThe two experimental studies showed no statistically difference in RNFLT (retina nerve fiber layer thickness) before and after the application of pressure (100 mmHg) to the eye ball during LASIK or for 45 seconds in normal eyes. It revealed the safety of LASIK to normal eyes with the application of 100 mmHg pressure for 45 seconds during surgery by quantitatively measuring the change of nerve fiber thickness using scanning laser tomography or nerve fiber analyzer (laser diagnostic technology).\\nAll the cases that report with abnormal optic nerve showed severe vision decrease due to LASIK. The case series of Lee had two identical conditions of this case (optic disc edema) and suffered severe vision loss after LASIK. However, in Cameron\\'s case with normal optic nerve before operation, there was development of optic neuropathy after LASIK.',\n",

She was not known to be hypertensive or addicted to drugs and had no personal or family history of bleeding disorders. She was conscious on admission and had no signs of focalization or meningeal syndrome. Her blood pressure, heart rate and temperature were respectively of 140/80 mmHg, 120 beats/min and 37 C. Non contrast cerebral CT scan revealed a compressive left fronto-parietal subdural hematoma (Figure 1). Routine hemostasis tests showed a platelet count of 130 giga/l, a prothrombin level of 70% and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 12 seconds. Surgical evacuation had been performed but the success of the procedure was short-lived as the hematoma had rapidly reconstructed to indicate neurosurgical re-intervention under massive infusion of fresh frozen plasma associated with repeated injections of tranexamic acid. In addition, cerebral magnetic resonance angiography did not show any underlying arteriovenous abnormalities (Figure 2). We maintained daily infusions of fresh frozen plasma (600 mL/d) and tranexamic acid and the post-operative clinical course was satisfactory (Figure 3).\\nThe spontaneous nature of the subdural hematoma associated with a normal hemostasis assessment suggested the hypothesis of an underlying \"occult\" coagulopathy. We measured factor XIII activity by photometric method and found a low rate of 41% (normal value: 70-140); the biological assessment showed a non-regenerative normochrome normocytic anemia at 7 g/dl, leuko-neutropenia at 3.6 giga/l without thrombocytopenia, C3/C4 hypocomplementemia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Bone marrow biopsy and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan were unremarkable. Antinuclear antibody testing was positive at a rate of 1/1280 with specificity for anti-dsDNA, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La (Figure 4). The antiphospholipid antibody test was negative. Liver function, renal function and 24-hour proteinuria were normal.\\nAll clinical and immunobiological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with hematologic tropism. Biopsy of the accessory salivary glands was discussed, looking for Gougerot syndrome associated with SLE. However, due to the hemorrhagic risk associated, this invasive procedure was not performed. The discovery of SLE had raised the possibility of an anti-factor XIII autoantibody, but this had not been sought in our context. The patient received an initial bolus of methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by oral relay at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone combined with hydroxy chloroquine 200 mg twice daily at patient s discharge. She was seen 1 month later and then every 3 to 6 months. The treatment was well observed with good tolerance. Three years later, the patient is free of treatement with no recurrence of hemorrhage, a normal blood count and a factor XIII level of 143%.',\n",

Originally, the tumor Ki-67 index was 5% and 24-hour urine 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) was 105 mg. The patient presented with mild progression of disease on abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1) after approximately 4 years of stable disease. Six months following this abdominal MRI, the patient developed bilateral lower extremity swelling, weight gain, and bloating lasting over 1 month. The serum brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP) value was 161 pg/ml (normal range < 100 pg/ml). N-terminal proBNP and other cardiac biomarkers were not available. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular wall thickening with an echogenic mass in the RV free wall extending to the RV outflow tract. There was severe malcoaptation of the thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Tricuspid regurgitation was described as widely open regurgitation with a peak regurgitant flow velocity of 203 cm/s. Of note, the aortic and mitral valves were structurally normal without stenosis or regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was obtained for further evaluation.\\nCMR (Figure 2) showed a 2.6 cm lesion in the right ventricular free wall and a 2.4 cm lesion in the left ventricular anteroseptal wall. These lesions demonstrated high T2-weighted signal and isointense T1-weighted signal with postcontrast perfusion, findings compatible with myocardial metastases. Of note, the RV free wall lesion extended superiorly near the base of the tricuspid valve annular region. Balanced cine steady state free precession (bSSFP) images showed abnormal thickening of the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet, and the leaflet did not coapt normally during systole contributing to severe tricuspid regurgitation. The right atrium was moderately dilated.\\nThe patient underwent bioprosthetic tricuspid valve replacement and biopsy and debulking of the myocardial tumors. The myocardial tumors were histologically confirmed as NET metastases.

Neurological exam did not identify any change: sensory and motor examinations were normal and there was no facial asymmetry, aphasia, dysarthria, or dysmetria. Oculomotor movements and pupillary reflexes were preserved.\\nPrevious medical history included a known bicuspid aortic valve disease. 2 years later, and after a dental procedure, the patient developed an aortic valve endocarditis due to an infection from Streptococcus sanguinis. This led to an ischemic stroke, from which the patient recovered completely. He was under antibiogram-directed antibiotic therapy for 1 month when a second stroke happened, and he was then submitted to an urgent surgical replacement of the aortic valve for a mechanical prosthesis that went well.

At the time of presentation of this case, the patient had medical records available that confirmed INR values between 2 and 2.5 for the last year.\\nDifferential diagnosis for single eye acute visual loss includes an acute stroke/transient ischemic accident, compressive lesion, trauma, infection, Purtscher retinopathy and occlusion of the central retinal artery due to either atherosclerotic disease, embolism, arteritis or the presence of a hypercoagulable state (due to neoplastic disease or inherited pro-coagulative diseases, for example).\\nA fundoscopic exam was immediately performed and identified the foveola assuming a cherry red spot-like image with retinal whitening, which suggested that the visual loss had been caused by a central retinal artery occlusion (Figure 1(a)). Due to the patient's previous medical history, cardiology observation was required to search for a cardiac source of embolism. The patient's physical exam was normal, with cardiac auscultation identifying a clear metallic click as the second cardiac sound and a slight nonradiating systolic murmur (I/VI). A TTE was performed, showing a nonobstructive aortic prosthesis and a periprosthetic echolucent pulsatile region with a hyperechogenic mobile round structure inside (Figures 1(b) and 2).

The cause of his symptoms was unclear, with the patient linking the episode to minor trauma. Initially, he had seen a chiropodist who diagnosed him with an in-grown toenail. The toenail was subsequently removed; however, his symptoms worsened. At this stage, he was noted to have subungual discolouration. A punch biopsy was performed with histology demonstrating a pigmented keratinous disc, and he was subsequently referred to our service as a possible case of malignant melanoma.\\nHe has no other significant past medical history and did not take any regular medication. He smoked approximately 10 cigarettes per day since aged 15.\\nUpon review in clinic, he was found to have an ulcerated area over the dorsum of his left middle toe with associated erythema and swelling, which was actively discharging pus but good peripheral pulses. He also reported a 6-week history of similar symptoms on his left index finger, over the dorsum of the proximal inter-phalangeal joint (PIPJ) which had appeared spontaneously. He had been treated with several courses of oral antibiotics by his general practitioner with no improvement. He was admitted acutely for intravenous antibiotics, surgical exploration and washout of both digits, and a biopsy of the left middle toe for microbiology and histology to rule out osteomyelitis and malignant melanoma. Initial biopsy of the nail bed excluded malignancy and instead showed acute inflammatory changes. The index finger defect was further debrided and closed with a local flap.\\nFollowing this initial surgical intervention, the patient went on to have a long and protracted clinical course from complications of poor wound healing and necrosis, with multiple hospital admissions over a 15-month period. He was reviewed by the vascular team with full assessment of peripheral vasculature using ankle-brachial pressure index and computed tomography (CT) angiography which did not identify a specific cause for his necrotic digits. He developed osteomyelitis of both the left third toe and left index finger, which required amputation to prevent proximal spread of infection. A clinical diagnosis of TAO was suspected when he developed similar symptoms in the adjacent left second toe 2 months after initial presentation. Negative autoimmune, vasculitic and coagulopathy screening blood tests, including anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, anti-thrombin, proteins C and S, supported the diagnosis. Genotyping for prothrombin mutations was negative; however, the patient was positive for homozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Verbal smoking cessation advice was reinforced frequently; however, the patient found complete abstinence difficult. This ultimately resulted in a Ray amputation of the second and third toes due continued non-healing (Figure 1). Following this, he underwent a short period of remission. Unfortunately due to ongoing use of tobacco, symptoms recurred in the contralateral and dominant right hand affecting his index and middle finger tips (Figure 2A and B). The right index finger became gangrenous and required amputation. During the procedure, a segment of digital artery was biopsied. Histopathologic analysis showed evidence of chronic inflammation with lymphocytic arteritis and thrombosis, confirming a diagnosis of TAO (Figure 3).',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The patient was a 41-year-old male (body weight of 70 kg) who was admitted to the Kidney Critical Unit of Jiangsu Province Hospital due to recurrent fever for more than 10 days. The patient had a history of uremia for more than 10 years. He had been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy via hemodialysis. The patient got a fever (38.6  C) and chills for unknown reason about 10 days prior. Oral prednisone and ibuprofen suspension were used to help control the fever of unknown origin but only contained the temperature temporarily. Echocardiography and laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis of acute IE caused by MRSA, which was isolated from sputum and blood culture. A local hospital had used vancomycin plus moxifloxacin to treat IE which failed. The patient also had a history of restless leg syndrome for 9 years and thoracic trauma in March 2021.\\nAt the time of admission, the patient had a clear mind in thinking. Physical examination showed body temperature of 36.8 C, respiratory frequency 25 breaths per minute, heart rate 124 beats per minute, and blood pressure 107/75 mmHg. Wet rales were heard on both lungs. Chest CT scan identified multiple patchy nodular opacities with cavities in both lungs. Systolic heart murmur was heard over the tricuspid valve area. Echocardiography revealed the presence of tricuspid valve vegetation along with left heart enlargement and abnormal ventricular wall movement. Moderate reflux of mitral valve and tricuspid valve and reduction of left ventricular contractile function were also confirmed (Supplementary Video 1). The left ventricular ejection fraction was about 20%. Initial laboratory tests showed significant leukocytosis (WBC 21.4x109/L) and neutrophils predominance (90.1%), decreased lymphocytes (1.1x109/L), anemia (hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL), and platelet count of 260x109/L. Serum procalcitonin was elevated to 1.55 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.5 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was also significantly higher (>35,000 pg/mL) than normal range (<125 pg/mL). MRSA was isolated from sputum and blood culture repeatedly (on July 8, July 17, and July 24). This clinical evidence confirmed the diagnosis of right heart IE due to MRSA (Table 1).\\nVancomycin (1.0 g q12h) and moxifloxacin were used to control infection initially in accordance with the guideline for management of IE and the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. However, the patient had recurrent fever up to 39.0 C until admission to our hospital. After admission, moxifloxacin was switched to daptomycin (420 mg qd) plus cefoperazone-sulbactam (3.0 g q8h) empirically considering the potent activities of daptomycin against MRSA and possible Gram-negative bacterial infection. Emergency surgical procedures were carried out to remove the vegetation on the tricuspid papillary muscle and replace the tricuspid valve. Unfortunately, fever remained after the operation, which was considered partly due to bloodstream and pulmonary MRSA infection. Secondary Acinetobacter baumannii infection was also possible because a new infection was detected by chest radiography. Vancomycin was combined with daptomycin to control MRSA infection because daptomycin alone was insufficient. Considering the severe underlying disease of the patient, nephrotoxicity of vancomycin, and possible bleeding tendency due to oral anticoagulants after surgery, the anti-MRSA regimen was further adjusted. Contezolid 800 mg was administered orally twice daily to replace vancomycin to target MRSA. Tigecycline and meropenem were also used to deal with the secondary pulmonary infection caused by A. baumannii. The clinical symptoms were resolved and the temperature was normlalized 15 days after contezolid add-on therapy (Figure 1). The subsequent blood culture was negative. \\nAt the 3-month follow-up since the diagnosis of IE, no relapse of infection or drug-related adverse reaction was reported. The latest follow-up laboratory tests on February 14, 2022 (6 months after discharge from hospital) did not show any symptoms or signs of IE. The liver function and coagulation tests were generally normal except slight bleeding tendency, evidenced by prothrombin time of 15.9 seconds (normal range: 10.2-12.9) and international normalized ratio of 1.35 (normal range: 0.87-1.16). Overall, the refractory IE caused by MRSA was successfully treated with oral contezolid 800 mg every 12 hours (twice daily) for 45 days.',\n",

The net was adjusted so that Fpz, Cz, Oz, and the pre-auricular points were correctly placed according to the international 10/20 system. The net's geodesic tension structure is such that all electrodes could be evenly distributed over the scalp at approximately the same location in all patients. The data were recorded against a vertex electrode reference (Cz) at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Patients were seated in a relaxed position; the total EEG recording time was around 40 min.\\nThe experiment was performed using a 3T MRI scanner (Allegra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a standard transmit/receive head coil. For the ASL data, a pulsed PICORE sequence (proximal inversion with a control for off-resonance effects) with the Q2TIPS scheme (QUIPSS II with thin-slice TI1 periodic saturation) was used. Interleaved control and label images (80 volumes) were acquired using a 2D gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) readout with the following scan parameters: TR/TE = 3500/16 ms; TI1/TIs/TI2 = 700/1400/1600 ms and 90  flip angle. Sixteen axial slices in ascending order were prescribed and positioned parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure line (3.5x3.5x5 mm3, with an inter-slice gap of 1 mm) in order to cover the presumed focus location. The labeling slice was 10 cm thick and was separated from the proximal slice of the acquisition volume by a 20-mm gap. A calibration scan with the same parameters as the ASL sequence but longer TR (10 s) was also acquired to estimate the equilibrium magnetization of arterial blood (M0b). The overall acquisition time for ASL was approximatively 6 mins, including the additional calibration scan. A high-resolution whole brain anatomical scan was acquired for each subject using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence ([MPRAGE], TR/TE = 2300/3.9 ms; FOV = 192 x 192; matrix = 256 x 256; 176 sagittal slices 1.0 mm in thickness). Other high-resolution anatomical images, including T2-weighted, FLAIR and inversion recovery with 2D readout, were also acquired in order to assess for the presence of structural alterations such as hippocampal sclerosis or malformations of cortical development.\\nHdEEG data were analyzed using Cartool software (http://sites.google.com/site/cartoolcommunity/). The T1-weighted anatomical images were used to create a realistic model of the brain for source localization. In each patient, the hdEEG and MRI data and the solution space were restricted to the gray matter. The solution space for the distributed source model contained from 3,028 to 3,088 points uniformly distributed over the gray matter of the brain and mapped onto the spherical head model with anatomical constraints (SMAC) space. The peak of the spike was used as a trigger for averaging in epochs of +-500 ms. Two time frames were chosen to characterize spike topography: the first, from the beginning of the spike to the time point at 50% of the rising phase, was defined as an epoch characterizing a possible source of the spike generator; in the second, an epoch at the peak of the spike was defined as indicating propagation. A standardized source imaging procedure, ([LORETA] low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) constrained to the individual gray matter, was applied to the averaged spikes. From the ESI, the current density (CD) was quantified at each solution point [muA/mm3].\\nASL data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL 5.0.1 (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) and Matlab 7.14 (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with a dedicated home-made code created for this study. Motion correction was applied separately to the Control and Label volumes using the MCFLIRT tool and taking the first volume as reference. In particular, a six-parameter 3D rigid-body registration with a normalized correlation cost function was used. The ASL calibration scan was used for estimating the coregistration parameters from ASL to the individual T1-weighted image by applying a 3D rigid-body registration with a normalized mutual-information cost function and 7 degrees of freedom.\\nAfter these pre-processing steps, surround subtraction was applied to the Control and Label volumes to obtain a 4D matrix representing the perfusion-weighted maps. Unlike what is usually done in ASL studies, DeltaM represents the whole set of perfusion-weighted maps (one volume per repetition) instead of a single perfusion-weighted map obtained by averaging across the repetitions. In this way, a 4D matrix for the CBF parameter can be estimated for each subject and the temporal information given by the different repetitions will allow measurement of the within-subject variance. The standard kinetic model was applied to the 4D DeltaM matrix to estimate the blood flow maps in physiological units [ml/100g/min]. The CBF values were calculated as follows:  where DeltaM is the difference signal, TI 1 and TI 2 are the sequence time parameters described above, n is the slice number, slice time is the time taken to acquire each single slice (~ 50ms), T 1B is the longitudinal relaxation time of blood (1664 ms at 3T), and alpha is the inversion efficiency (0.95 for pulsed ASL). M ob was calculated as the ratio between the mean tissue equilibrium magnetization value in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) region (from the calibration scan) and the brain-blood partition coefficient.\\nFor each subject, the mean and variance values over all repetitions were calculated for the CBF parameter. These maps in ASL space were affine-registered to the individual high-resolution anatomical images by applying the previously estimated transformation matrix. Each T1-weighted image was then registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with 1x1x1 mm3 resolution using a non-linear method (FNIRT tool in FSL). Finally, the joint ASL/T1-weighted and T1-weighted/MNI space transformation parameters were used to spatially normalize the CBF maps representing the mean and variance values.\\nFor each subject, the CBF images in MNI space were intensity normalized to compensate for mean inter-subject perfusion variations. Indeed, voxel-wise ASL detection studies, where the focus is on local variations across the brain, have shown that an intensity normalization step is advised to increase the sensitivity, also due to the large inter-subject variability in global CBF values. The value used for the intensity normalization was equal to the mean CBF in gray matter, applying a threshold of 70% for detecting pure gray matter voxels, similarly to. The partial volume estimates for gray matter were derived from segmentation of the normalized anatomical image using the FAST tool in FSL. In addition, the non-physiological negative perfusion estimates present in the gray matter normalization mask were excluded from the mean CBF calculation in order to define a more reliable reference value.\\nFor comparing each patient to the control group, a two-step procedure was performed: construction of a normal perfusion template and then a one-versus-many statistical analysis. The heteroscedastic approach was used in the analysis (mixed-effect model).\\nThe first step entailed CBF template construction from the control group images. The template was created using the FLAME 1 (FMRIB's local analysis of mixed effects-stage 1) tool available in FSL software, which uses Bayesian modeling and explicitly accounts for the within-subject variance. For each subject, normalized CBF images representing the mean CBF estimates and the CBF within-subject variance were supplied to the FLAME 1 tool. The data from the healthy subjects were pooled into one group, and the group maps (mean and variance) were estimated with this tool. In a heteroscedastic model, the group variance will reflect both the within-subject and the between-subject variability.\\nIn the second step, comparison of the control group versus each single patient was carried out using an unpooled-variance unpaired two-sample t-test in order to consider both the group variance and the patient variance. The t-statistic, for testing whether the estimated patient versus control group means were different, was calculated as:  where mu and sigma 2 represent the estimated mean and variance for the patient (p) and the control group (c) respectively, and N represents the number of subjects (17 and 1 for N c and N p, respectively). A negative tvalue indicates that, at the voxel of interest, the mean is higher in the patient than in the control group, thus identifying possibly hyperperfused areas (patient > controls). Conversely, a positive tvalue indicates possible areas of hypoperfusion (patient < controls).\\nThe simplest approximation was adopted for defining the degrees of freedom (df), assigning df = n-p-1, where n is the total number of subjects and p the number of fixed (dummy) variables such as subject-specific covariates like age or behavioral data. The same approach was also implemented in the statistic test in FLAME 1 of FSL. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction (q < 0.05) for multiple comparisons was applied to the statistical results to detect the areas of statistically significant alterations in perfusion.\\nThe procedure for the automatic detection of patient-specific perfusion abnormalities was applied to the 6 new patients and to the 6 patients evaluated in the previous study in order to further confirm the results and the observations from the region of interest (ROI) analysis.\\nFor each patient, the mean CBF map from ASL and ESI results was overlaid on individual T1-weighted anatomical MRI images to combine all of them in the same anatomical space using FSL tools. As in the previous study, a series of ROIs was identified using the Harvard-Oxford Atlas to compare the ESI and ASL results in terms of CD and CBF inside the same areas, using the spatially normalized data. Quantification was restricted to the gray matter, including voxels whose probability to belong to the gray matter was at least 80%. All measures were compared to the contralateral side. The five ROIs with the highest differences in CD and CBF values are reported here. This was done to quantitatively compare the information provided by ASL and ESI and to evaluate the agreement with the results of the statistical analysis. Areas over the epileptic focus are expected to be characterised by high CD values and low CBF values in comparison to the correspondent contralateral ROI, if the patient is in interictal phase.\\nIn patients undergoing surgical resection, freedom from seizure following the operation can be considered the ground truth and the most unambiguous proof of correct localization of the epileptogenic focus. In order to assess the localization reliability of the ESI and ASL results, the presurgical information were overlaid on the postoperative MRI scan of each patient to determine whether or not the ESI and ASL maps were congruent and overlapped well with the resected tissue areas. Importantly, although the extension of a resected area tends to be overestimated and larger than the actual epileptogenic zone in most patients, seizure freedom following resection can be taken as proof of correct localization on a sublobar level. Therefore, the preoperative anatomical MRI scan was coregistered with the postoperative scan, and the estimated coregistration parameters were inversely transformed in order to project the postoperative image over the original preoperative scan. To assess the ESI and ASL results, the rising phase of epileptiform activity and the statistical maps were used, respectively, and were overlapped on the coregistered postoperative anatomical image.\",\n",

He was on maximal medical therapy and had received multiple prior percutaneous coronary interventions and two previous coronary artery bypass surgeries. Recent coronary angiography revealed no possibility of further revascularization. He was evaluated for Orthotropic Heart Transplant (OHT) and listed as Status 1A-e (urgent need). His worsening intractable angina and dyspnea necessitated IABP placement via left axillary artery, which significantly improved his condition. Axillary artery was the chosen site of insertion (as opposed to femoral artery) in order to enable ambulation and prevent deconditioning, as the patient was awaiting transplant. The IABP was placed under fluoroscopic guidance, with the tip of the IABP placed few centimeters below the aortic arch, as confirmed radiologically. Following the procedure, the patient complained of new-onset, persistent, throbbing, and burning left-sided frontoparietal pain above the left lateral eyebrow that radiated to the left orbit, with an intensity of 7/10 on the numerical pain scale. It was aggravated by movement and relieved by pressure, with frequent watery eyes without visual changes. He had a remote history of traumatic brain injury due to motor vehicle accident but he denied any subsequent headache.\\nExamination revealed tender and bulging left temporal artery suspicious of temporal arteritis (TA); however, his normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate minimized TA as a likely diagnosis. Nonetheless, he was offered prophylactic prednisone, which he refused. Pain management service was consulted and multimodal treatment including acetaminophen, oxycodone, citalopram, and tizanidine was initiated, while nitrates were withheld. The patient reported limited relief and continued to complain of a persistent pain in the same distribution. Subsequently, left supraorbital neuralgia was hypothesized, and gabapentin was initiated with limited benefit. A supraorbital block was offered, which was refused, and patient insisted on discontinuing the IABP.\\nIn accordance with patient's wishes, the IABP was weaned and removed, and nitrates were initiated for angina prophylaxis. On postremoval assessment, the patient's headache had completely resolved with no future recurrence. He subsequently received OHT and was discharged with normal EF and no further headaches.\",\n",

A 52-year-old man with endothelial dysfunction of unknown cause in the right eye was selected as the recipient. Slit-lamp examination revealed an opaque cornea due to advanced endothelial dysfunction (Figure 1A). The left eye was normal on slit-lamp examination without any guttata. There was no history of ophthalmic intervention in the past in either eye.\\nThe donor cornea from a child 2 years of age after brain death was supplied from a domestic eye bank. The time from cardiac death to enucleation was 3 hours, and the time to processing was 1 hour. The donor was transplanted 2 days later. The endothelial cell density of the infant donor was as high as 4,291 cells/mm2. The central thickness of the donor measured by ultrasound pachymeter was 561 mum. Since the elasticity and tenderness of the infant donor tissue were extremely high, there were no striae on the surface of the endothelial cell layer after the donor sclerocorneal tissue was harvested (Figure 2).\\nIntraoperative and postoperative complications, including iatrogenic primary graft failure, donor graft dislocation, and pupillary air block glaucoma were documented. Best corrected visual acuity and donor central endothelial cell density were recorded preoperatively and at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. The decimal visual acuity were used as measures of visual acuity and converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). The central endothelial cell density was measured with noncontact specular microscopy (Noncon Robo; Konan Medical, Hyogo, Japan), using the center method as outlined by the manufacturer's software. The postoperative cell loss rate was calculated as a percentage of the preoperative donor endothelial cell density as provided in the information from the domestic eye bank.\\nThe surgery was performed at the Department of Ophthalmology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, using a technique as reported previously. The patient read and signed an informed consent form prior to surgery.\\nThe donor cornea was dissected with a microkeratome (ALTK Cbm; Moria, Antony, France) equipped with a 300 mum head. The donor tissue was extremely elastic and soft compared with the adult tissue. After microkeratome dissection, the donor tissue was transferred to a punching system and cut with an 8.0 mm diameter punch (Barron Donor Cornea Punch; Katena Products Inc., Denville, NJ, USA). The central corneal thickness of the infant donor cornea and the residual corneal stromal bed left after lamellar microkeratome cut was not measured.\\nPhacoemulsification and a single-piece acrylic intraocular lens insertion procedure was performed via a 3 mm clear corneal temporal incision just before nDSAEK. Since the cornea was too opaque to obtain a clear surgical view during phacoemulsification, trypan blue staining of the anterior capsule, corneal epithelial debridement was performed for better visualization of the anterior chamber. Since the cornea was too opaque to remove the Descemet membrane, we decided not to remove the membrane in this case (nDSAEK). The surgical procedure of nDSAEK was described previously. In brief, three corneal fenestrations were performed to drain the interface fluid. A small inferior iridectomy at the 6 o'clock position was then routinely created with a 25-gauge vitreous cutter (Medical Instrument Development Laboratories, San Leandro, CA, USA). Continuous irrigation from a 25-gauge anterior chamber maintainer (25 gauge DSAEK Chamber Maintainer, Catalog number AE-7802; Asico, Westmont, IL, USA) was used. An ophthalmic viscosurgical device (Viscoat; Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX, USA) was applied to the endothelial surface of the graft, and the donor graft was inserted using a Busin glide and an intraocular lens sheet glide (double glide technique). After insertion of the donor graft, the wound was secured with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. Air was injected into the anterior chamber to press the donor graft against the recipient cornea. Corneal massage was performed to adjust the centered position of the donor graft and to eliminate residual fluid at the donor graft-recipient interface. Residual interface fluid was also drained through corneal venting incisions. The anterior chamber was left full of air, and the patient was instructed to lie on his back for at least 1 hour.\",\n",

The swelling was not associated with any changes in salivation, but she had difficulty in articulation due to its size. Her medical history was insignificant. She had no history of tobacco use or any other adverse habits.\\nOn retraction of the tongue, a solitary 5 cm x 4 cm swelling was noted in the floor of the mouth on the right side, crossing the midline till the lower left central incisor, completely obliterating the lingual vestibule and occupying the entire floor of the mouth on that side [Figure 1]. The mucosa overlying the swelling was adherent to the lingual gingiva in the region of the lower right premolars [Figure 2]. On palpation, the swelling was well defined, firm in consistency, regular surface, nontender, nonpulsatile, and not bimanually palpable. The mucosa overlying the swelling was freely movable except at the region of attachment to the gingiva. The submandibular ducts were patent and milking of the gland yielded normal saliva.\\nThere was no evidence of salivary calculi or bony erosion in the mandibular occlusal radiograph. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an enhancing mass lesion in the right sublingual region [Figures 3 and 4]. In view of the history, clinical features, and CT findings, we came to the diagnosis of a salivary gland tumor in the sublingual region. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was reported as sialadenitis of minor salivary gland. An incisional biopsy was thus carried out, which revealed the presence of mucous acini suggestive of minor salivary gland showing periductal inflammation and a very small portion of tumor cells arranged in cribriform pattern and cystic spaces filled with eosinophilic coagulum [Figure 5]. Hence, we came to a diagnosis of salivary gland tumor arising from the minor salivary gland with high suspicion of malignancy. Excisional biopsy of the lesion was hence planned under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the swelling was found to be submucosal and well-encapsulated [Figure 6]. Wide excision of the lesion, including the overlying mucosa and the distal portion of the submandibular duct was carried out. On gross examination of the excised specimen, there was no evidence of major salivary gland seen. Histopathological examination showed areas with features of PA with an overlying capsule containing ducts and acini. The ducts showed an inner epithelial cell layer and outer myoepithelial cell layer embedded in myxohyalinous background matrix, presence of transitional zones showing capsular invasion with cells arranged in cribriform and tubular pattern having cytomorphologic features of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Invasion into the surrounding capsule as well as adjoining minor salivary glands was evident, with no perineural invasion. Based on the histopathological findings, we arrived at a diagnosis of Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA) of the minor salivary gland with capsular infiltration. The patient was hence referred for postoperative radiotherapy. The patient is doing well and no evidence of recurrence has been noted after 1-year.',\n",

He reported pain within the first week of initiating running at basic training. He was diagnosed with bilateral proximal tibia stress fractures at three weeks with instructions to stop impact activities. After failure of his symptoms to improve, he was referred to our facility. On presentation, he had tenderness about the medial aspect of each proximal tibia. Radiographs obtained at that time demonstrated bilateral proximal tibia stress fractures with varus alignment about each knee and articular collapse of the left tibial plateau. Metabolic labs were obtained and significant for a low vitamin D (15), but the remainders of labs including calcium, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and testosterone were unremarkable. MRI of the left knee demonstrated a medial tibial plateau fracture with two millimeters of articular depression and extension of the fracture to the tibial spine (Figure 1(a)). MRI of the right knee demonstrated a hypointense linear T2 signal surrounded by diffuse hyperintense signal suggesting a medial tibial plateau stress fracture with surrounding bone edema, without articular collapse or extension (Figure 1(b)). These fractures were at the level of the physis, and there was surrounding sclerosis on plain radiographs. Given the collapse of the articular surface in his left knee, the patient was indicated for open reduction internal fixation with allograft bone. The patient underwent the aforementioned procedure without complication, and the patient remained nonweight bearing to his bilateral lower extremities (Figure 2(a)). At the time of surgery, the bone at the fracture distal to the articular surface was softer and more friable in composition than expected for the stress fracture. It was easily debrided back to stable, healthy bone edges, and we were interested in analyzing its composition, so a biopsy was obtained and sent to the lab for analysis. Histology demonstrated nonossifying hyaline cartilage with admixed fibroconnective tissue consistent with a persistent physis (Figure 3(a)).\\nAt the six-week follow-up visit after the procedure on his left knee, the patient was still having significant pain in his right lower extremity and, after extensive counseling, elected to undergo the same procedure on the contralateral limb in an effort to return to running and continue his military career (Figure 2(b)). We suspected that a similar pathology of a persistent physis was present in the right proximal tibia and that this was contributing to his slow healing progression. Similar intraoperative pathology specimens were again obtained at the fracture site distal to the articular surface (Figure 3(b)), and these demonstrated fragments of purple to purple-gray staining matrix with chondroid metaplasia. This presence of cartilage distal to the articular surface was consistent with a persistent physis.\\nAt four-and-a-half months from the index procedure (three months from the staged procedure), the patient was ambulating without assisted devices and had painless range of motion from 0 to 120  in each knee with well-healed incisions, maintained hardware and alignment, but had not returned to impact activities.

He reported a history of drinking unpasteurized milk and contact with farm animals but denied any history of contact with tuberculosis (TB) patients. There was no history of diabetes mellitus (DM). There was no family history of malignancy or rheumatologic disease. Prior to this presentation, he had frequent visits to the ED due to increased fatigability and joint pain. However, no diagnosis was established, and the treatment was often conservative. On this admission, he was managed empirically with intravenous (IV) tazocin and IV paracetamol, given his history. A septic workup was also performed. Laboratory investigations revealed positive serology for Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (58 mm/hr), C-reactive protein (CRP) (165.08 mg/dl), and leukocytosis (23.32x103/muL). Chest X-ray (CXR) was unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with brucellosis and, eventually, discharged on doxycycline and rifampin. In addition, he was scheduled for a neurological follow-up to assess his progressive fatigability.\\nAfter one month, on 17 November 2020, he was seen in the neurology clinic. The diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was suggested as radiculoneuropathy, and axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy was proven by electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS). Accordingly, the patient was admitted and received immunoglobulin (IVIG) as recommended by the neurologist. After one week of receiving IVIG, his condition was still not improving and he was referred to the outpatient rheumatology clinic to exclude possible vasculitic processes. Later on, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic complaining of multiple joint pain and swelling of wrists, fingers, elbows, knees, ankle, and foot, which started four weeks earlier to his visit.\\nThe pain and swelling in the knees and elbows almost completely improved after brucellosis therapy. However, he was still complaining of pain and swelling in the other joints, which usually worsened at night and improved with movement. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) was strongly positive (131), ESR was 53 mm/1 hr, and CRP was 132.83 mg/dL. Rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA), and ferritin were all normal. Despite being on appropriate antibiotics treatment for brucellosis, his fever did not subside. It was recurring in episodes, with each episode lasting 20 minutes per day. The fever was not associated with sweating, shivering, or other constitutional symptoms. Furthermore, based on the constellation of several findings, which include the persisting fever despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the EMG/NCS finding of axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, the persistence of elevated inflammatory markers, the positive P-ANCA, and imaging that did not show any masses or fluid collection, the likelihood of underlying systemic vasculitis was high according to the rheumatology team. Therefore, prednisolone 50 mg PO OD was started. In addition, he was continued on doxycycline and rifampin for another set of 11 days to complete six weeks of the brucellosis treatment course.\\nAfter one week of being on steroids, his fever totally subsided and other symptoms had significantly improved. Also, his CRP started to decrease, reaching 79.59 mg/dl. However, P-ANCA was still high (119.4). Therefore, the decision was made to continue on prednisolone 50 mg for another week, followed by 40 mg for two weeks and then 30 mg for two weeks. On the next visit after four weeks on 27 December 2020, he reported significant improvement in his symptoms with no more joint pain and resumed his normal activities independently. Also, lab results showed decreased P-ANCA to 57.8 and CRP to 19.36 mg/dL. Azathioprine 50 mg PO twice a day was added while he continued taking steroids with a tapering dose. After four weeks, on 26 January 2021, he reported that he was no longer experiencing fever, fatigue, joint swelling, or pain. However, he could not actively flex or extend his left index finger or right thumb, which was attributed to his peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, azathioprine dose was optimized to 50 mg three times a day. The patient was reevaluated on 7 March 2021. He was found to be asymptomatic, with no active complaints. Subsequently, azathioprine dosage was reduced to 50 mg PO BID.',\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a growing peripherally enhancing 1.2 cm mass (0.8 cm 2 months prior) in the left precentral gyrus that had previously received linear-accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to 20 Gy 9 months prior (with 99% coverage of the target volume), a new left cerebellar 0.4 cm lesion, and a growing left posterior temporal/medial occipital 0.6 cm lesion (0.4 cm 2 months prior) [Figure 1]. The patient was awake and alert with cranial nerves grossly intact. She had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1.\\nThe patient had a complicated oncological treatment history, including a previous diagnosis of right breast adenocarcinoma status post breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation, concurrent definitive chemoradiation for her originally diagnosed limited-stage SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), and SRS to multiple brain metastases. [Figure 2] provides a timeline summarizing her major treatments.\\nFollowing discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board, the patient underwent craniotomy and resection of her left precentral gyrus lesion, with pathology demonstrating metastatic SCLC. Given that the target area had previously received radiation therapy with PCI and SRS, the patient was given 35 Gy in 100 fractions over the course of 3 weeks, using PRDR for re-irradiation treatment at an apparent dose rate of 0.178 Gy/min for a cumulative dose of 80 Gy.

MRI brain showed improvement with marked reduction in enhancement in the lesions in the left precentral gyrus, left occipital, and left cerebellar lesions. The patient was started on palliative carboplatin and etoposide. In 5 months following the PRDR treatment, the patient maintained good motor function of her right hand but developed progression of disease with two new 3 mm brain metastases in the right temporal and left parietal regions that were outside the previously treated PRDR field. She received 24 Gy SRS to those lesions. She then developed progression in the mediastinum and retroperitoneum, although there was no evidence of recurrence within the PRDR-treated radiation field. The patient was started on palliative pembrolizumab but in the coming months had a gradual decrease in her overall performance status with increased altered mental status and hospitalizations. After discussion with neurosurgery and palliative care, the patient switched her care to home hospice, which she continues with 14 years elapsing since her initial diagnosis.',\n",

A 41-year-old male was referred to our outpatient radiation oncology clinic with recurrent glioblastoma of the thoracic spinal cord. He had originally been diagnosed 3 years prior after presenting with progressive back pain and left leg weakness. At that time, imaging revealed a T11-12 intramedullary tumor measuring 5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm in dimension. There were multiloculated cystic components which had peripheral enhancement. He underwent a thoracolumbar laminectomy and microsurgical resection of the spinal cord tumor 3 weeks later. Final pathology was consistent with a WHO grade 4 glioblastoma, KI-67-10%, IDH-1 negative, and ATRX expression retained, to which concurrent chemotherapy and radiation were recommended. He underwent adjuvant 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of radiation to the thoracic resection cavity with 12 cycles of temozolomide.\\nTwo and a half years after the original resection, his left leg weakness progressed, and an MRI of the thoracic spine showed definite tumor progression. Additional chemotherapy with temozolomide, Avastin, isotretinoin, and lomustine did not slow the progression of the tumor. At the time of evaluation, the patient reported a 6-month history of a 20-pound weight loss, worsening bilateral leg weakness, numbness and tingling in both legs, erectile dysfunction, inability to ambulate with both legs causing wheelchair use, increased urinary frequency, and occasional difficulty holding bowel movements. He denied any pain. His ECOG performance status was 3.\\nMRI thoracic spine revealed a recurrent thoracic lesion 2.2 x 1 x 0.8 cm [Figure 6]. His bevacizumab and lomustine were placed on hold due to myelosuppression, with the bevacizumab restarted after a break. The patient was retreated with palliative radiation in the same area at 50 Gy in 250 fractions over the course of 6 weeks, using PRDR technique at an apparent dose rate of 0.0562 Gy/min for a cumulative dose of 100.4 Gy. TomoHDA  Planning Station Version 5.1.1.6 (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used [Figure 7]. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks was given concurrently with radiation with the goal of decreasing the risk of radiation-induced injury, including edema and radiation necrosis, in the context of re-irradiation with PRDR.\\n[Figure 8] provides a cumulative dose-volume histogram on the organs at risk along with the PRDR targets based on the treatments to the brain using MIM software (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA).\\nImaging showed the lesion as stable at the 1-month follow-up appointment. He was able to walk with the assistance of a walker, which was an improvement from previously being bound by a wheelchair. Overall, the patient did not develop significant acute radiation side effects and reported to be very satisfied with his response to treatment.\\nEight months after completion of radiation treatment, the patient remained on bevacizumab under the care of his oncologist. The patient reported progressive weakness in his lower extremities and ongoing fatigue. MRI of the spine revealed worsening leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and the patient was discharged with home hospice. He died 2 months later, about 42 months after his initial diagnosis.',\n",

He had two hospitalization records in the past 1.5 years due to GI bleeding of unknown origin. Upon admission, the patient's blood pressure was 105/56 mmHg, and his heart rate was 115 beats/min. Physical examination revealed palpebral conjunctival pallor and a Levine 4/6 systolic murmur at the second right intercostal space. Blood test results (hemoglobin, 5.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 16.2%) indicated advanced anemia, and fecal occult blood reaction was positive. GI endoscopy could not reveal the origin of GI bleeding. Conservative therapy including fasting and transfusion improved the anemia, and fecal occult blood reaction also became negative. Echocardiography showed severe AS, with a peak aortic pressure gradient of 88.0 mmHg and effective orifice area of 0.52 cm2 (Fig. 1). The left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.61. Although the serum level of von Willebrand factor (vWF) activity was in the normal lower limit of 51% (normal range 50-150%), further hematologic examination by gel electrophoresis showed deficiency of high-molecular-weight multimers of vWF (Fig. 2). Although the origin of GI bleeding was unknown, the patient was diagnosed with Heyde syndrome because of the presence of AS and deficiency of high-molecular-weight multimers of vWF. He was transferred to our institution for further treatment. Considering a low risk of intraoperative death (logistic EuroSCORE of 2.56% and risk of mortality from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons adult cardiac surgery risk score of 0.788%), the patient was considered a suitable candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).\\nThe patient underwent elective surgery. SAVR using a 21-mm bioprosthesis was performed with standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), for which we selected unfractionated heparin anticoagulation. Aortic cross-clamp time was 71 min, and CPB time was 116 min. During the operation using heparin, there was no unexpected volume loss in which GI bleeding was considered. The postoperative course was uneventful. Under anticoagulant control of prothrombin time-international normalized ratio at 2.0-2.5, the patient did not develop recurrent anemia in the perioperative period (Fig. 3). The patient was discharged without subjective symptoms on postoperative day 18. The 20-month follow-up was unremarkable, with no episode of recurrent GI bleeding.\",\n",

In the delivery room, when the cervix had dilated 3 centimeters, epidural anesthesia for pain relief was administered. The patient was placed in the sitting C-shaped position and the skin was prepared with betadine solution. After local anesthesia, a needle, 18G Tuohy, was introduced into the palpation-identified L3-4 interspace, with confirmation by loss of resistance (LOR) technique. The epidural catheter was inserted to a depth of 5 cm cephalad without difficulty. A bacterial filter was attached. After a test with 60 mg of Lidocaine was negative, 0.1% bupivacaine and 2 mcg/mL fentanyl were infused with 8 mL/h. The other elements of the procedure were sterile, the anesthetist used a face mask and sterile gloves. However, a sterile gown was not worn during the whole procedure. Three hours later, cesarean section was indicated for the patient due to signs of fetal failure. The anesthetist administered a bolus of 400 mg lidocaine and 100 mcg fentanyl via the bacterial filter for the cesarean section. During surgery, the patient was completely stable and a 3300 g baby girl was delivered with the first- and fifth-minute APGAR score of 8 and 10 respectively. No surgical or anesthetic complications had been detected at this time. The epidural catheter remained in for the first 48 hours after surgery for infusion of 0.1% bupivacaine and 2 mcg/mL fentanyl at 6 mL/h through the filter, and was then removed. In the following days, the patient complained of backache that got worse gradually, but no fever was noted. However, on the fifth postoperative day, she had continuous high fever ranging from 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, fatigue, irritation, dyspnea, abdominal distention, backache radiating to the left thigh. General examination showed that she was conscious with a temperature of 39 degrees C and other vital signs within normal ranges. Neurological examination revealed no motor deficit of the lower extremities, normal tendon reflexes, normal bilateral muscle strength, and negative meningeal syndrome.\\nGynecological examination showed a good systaltic uterus and dry incision. The lumbar area at the epidural puncture site was swollen, painful, hot, and red. As shown by serum biochemistry there was prominent infection status with white blood cell count of 16.6G/l, CRP 112.7mg/L, procalcitonin 0.42 ng/mL. After 7 days, there were signs of increased infection including high fever, fatigue, irritability, regular dyspnea, shortness of breath (30 times/minute), drainage of pus from the puncture site of epidural anesthesia, tense abdomen; weakness, numbness and sensory disturbances in lower limbs. Results of blood culture showed that the pathogenic bacteria was Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiogram revealed appropriate antibiotics including vancomycin, carbapenem, cephalosporin and quinolone groups.\\nWe then transferred the patient to a hospital capable of spinal surgery where the lumbar spine MRI scan was obtained and showed an abscess at lumbar L3-4 and subarachnoid inflammation (Figures 1 and 2).\\nSince there were no changes in symptoms in the patient after using antibiotics, after two days, surgery was indicated to remove the absces and, clean the epidural area (Figure 3). Right before surgery, the patient developed numbness and sensory disturbances in lower limbs. Regarding motor deficit, the patient had weakness of muscle strength in lower limbs, ie, 2/5 on the left and 3/5 on the right, as well as reduced tendon reflex of bilateral legs, and negative meningeal syndrome.

He was born with webbed fingers and toes, as well as \"splotchy skin.\" He was diagnosed with Goltz syndrome with skin manifestations as an infant. In his late 20s, he started developing warts and skin tags over his body, and, later in his 30s, he started developing a papillomatous mass on his left inner thigh. His wife reported that the patient has been snoring for about 4 years; however, his snoring had significantly improved in the last 6 months. Other past medical history included obesity with a BMI of 43 and uncontrolled hypertension. Surgical history included a tonsillectomy as a teenager with no mention of anesthetic problems. He denied dysphagia and shortness of breath. Upon airway examination, he had a Mallampati score of 1 and full range of motion of his neck and mandible. The patient\\'s physical examination was significant for a scattered, reticular rash across his chest, as well as a large papillomatous skin mass on his left inner thigh. Induction of anesthesia was accomplished with fentanyl, lidocaine, propofol, and rocuronium. A two-handed mask ventilation technique was required due to his body habitus, though no signs of airway obstruction were noted. Oxygen saturation during mask ventilation was maintained at 100%. Direct laryngoscopy was attempted with Macintosh 4 blade, a grade 2 laryngeal view was obtained, and a mass at the base of the tongue was visualized pulling the vocal cords to the right and obstructing the view of the vocal cords. A glidescope was then used in order to better visualize the mass. With optimal visualization, a friable, large, papillomatous mass was noted at the right base of the tongue (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The trachea was intubated with an 8 mm endotracheal tube. General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, and the otolaryngology service was consulted intraoperatively for evaluation of the tongue mass. A small biopsy was taken, and then the surgical removal of the soft tissue mass on his thigh was performed. Upon completion of the thigh mass removal, the otolaryngology serviced returned for debridement of the tongue lesion to obtain a more clear view of the larynx and vocal cords. Upon completion of the debridement, the epiglottis and surrounding soft tissues were noted to be edematous. It was therefore decided to admit patient to the surgical intensive care unit and leave the trachea intubated overnight to safely allow the swelling to subside. After completion of three doses of dexamethasone 8 mg in the surgical intensive care unit, the trachea was uneventfully extubated and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 2.\\nThe pathological report for the debrided mass was interpreted as papillary lymphoid hyperplasia. The patient presented back to the operating room three weeks later for an elective removal of the remaining obstructing lesions. He was electively extubated the next day in the surgical ICU, just as the previous procedure, to allow for airway edema recovery. At a follow-up clinic visit with otolaryngologist one week later, the patient was breathing well, with no areas of concern for residual or recurrent pharyngeal disease.',\n",

He had previously been independent, but lightheadedness had occurred two months previously, after which he required a crutch to walk. Bilateral leg edema had developed three weeks prior to his admission, but there was no dyspnea. Although his appetite was good, he had noticed abdominal distension on the day before his hospitalization. The patient had a history of hypertension and had been diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus 20 years previously. Furthermore, he had been admitted to hospital seven years previously for sudden deafness of the right ear. He had no occupational history of asbestos exposure, and he had worked as a bank employee between the 20 and 57 years of age. At presentation, his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 118/67 mmHg; pulse rate, 95 beats/minute; body temperature, 36.9C, and oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry) while breathing room air, 100%. On examination, he had pallor of the palpebral conjunctiva. While there were no abnormalities of the thorax, the patient's abdomen was distended and there was bilateral flank dullness without tenderness or abnormal bowel sounds. He also had bilateral leg edema. Laboratory tests showed that his renal and liver functions were normal, but he had microcytic anemia (hemoglobin, 8.6 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 78.9 fL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin, 1.9 g/dL), and his C-reactive protein level was elevated to 15.8 mg/dL.\\nA chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio: 50%) without pleural effusion or pulmonary congestion, while an abdominal radiograph showed air limited to the epigastrium. He was admitted because of anemia, inflammation, and abdominal distension. His serum iron level was low (13 mug/dL) and his ferritin level was high (1,050 ng/mL), indicating disordered iron utilization and suggesting that his microcytic anemia had occurred secondarily to systemic inflammation. His urine was negative for protein, while his serum protein fractions showed a chronic inflammatory pattern that was characterized by a decrease in albumin and an increase in alpha1-globulin, alpha2-globulin, and gamma-globulin (polyclonal gammopathy). We performed enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) to investigate the cause of abdominal distension, which revealed massive ascites, thickening of the anterior peritoneum, and shortening of the mesentery (Fig. 1). Neither abdominal lymphadenopathy nor abnormalities of the solid viscera were observed. Paracentesis revealed cloudy yellow ascites with a high total protein concentration of 3.0 g/dL, indicating that it was an exudate. The serum-to-ascites albumin gradient was 0.6 g/dL, demonstrating the absence of portal hypertension. The glucose concentration was 98 mg/dL and the cell count was 150/muL (mainly lymphocytes and histiocytes without neutrophils). A bacterial culture of the ascites was negative, which made bacterial peritonitis unlikely. Tuberculous peritonitis was excluded by the normal adenosine deaminase level (16.7 IU/L). Because his cytology was class III, malignant ascites was suspected. His serum tumor marker levels, including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were normal. A gastrointestinal tract work-up revealed reflux esophagitis and chronic gastritis on endoscopy, but no malignant lesions were found. The patient vomited after endoscopy and developed chemical pneumonia due to the aspiration of gastric acid. The patient's respiratory insufficiency required ventilation, but he was subsequently weaned from the ventilator. However, he had recurrent vomiting and aspiration due to paralytic ileus. Cytological examinations of the ascitic fluid were repeated three times, but remained class II after the initial finding of class III. Because the patient's abdominal distension persisted, we performed the drainage of approximately 3 L of fluid; however, the re-accumulation was rapid and weekly drainage was required. The patient's hemoglobin level decreased to 6.9 g/dL and a transfusion of packed red cells was planned. A direct Coombs test was positive and warm antibody was detected in the blood examination before transfusion, despite the patient having no history of transfusion. We did not perform transfusion because agglutination occurred with all of the red cell products that were stored at our hospital. The patient died of aspiration pneumonia secondary to paralytic ileus on the 52nd day of hospitalization and an autopsy was performed with the consent of his family. The abdominal cavity contained 3,200 mL of clear yellowish ascites and the entire peritoneum was thickened with scattered small granules and nodules. Severe adhesion of the digestive tract was observed, which formed a cluster with the abdominal organs (Fig. 2). The entire peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and gallbladder showed prominent thickening, and there was also partial involvement of the liver and pancreas. A histological examination of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining sections revealed neoplastic cells with a tubulopapillary appearance (Fig. 3A), as well as tightly packed spindle cells (Fig. 3B), which represented epithelioid and sarcomatous tumor components, respectively. The tumor cells were negative for carcinoembryonic antigen (a marker of adenocarcinoma), but were positive for HBME-1 (Fig. 4A), calretinin (Fig. 4B), cytokeratin, CAM 5.2, and cytokeratin 5/6 (markers of mesothelioma) on immunohistochemical staining.

The proportion of class-switched CD19+CD27+IgD-memory B-cells (0.2 x 108/L, 0.6%) was decreased. IgH gene rearrangement analysis demonstrated a polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis pattern (Supplementary Figure 1). The patient had mild hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 3.1 g/L) associated with slightly decreased serum IgA levels (0.19 g/L), absent serum IgM (< 0.25 g/L) and normal IgE levels (63 mug/L). IgE levels increased to 444 mug/L (normal 0-240 mug/L) later when the patient reached 4 years of age. Although, the patient received all recommended vaccines for age (including live attenuated vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella), he had no specific antibody responses against Haemophilus influenzae type B (IgG < 0.1 mug/mL) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0/14 IgG serotypes were above 1.3 mug/mL). The specific antibody responses were normal for tetanus (IgG above 4.0 IU/mL) and diphtheria toxoids (IgG above 3.0 IU/mL). Lymphocyte proliferation responses to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and anti-CD3 were also normal. Pokeweed mitogen proliferative response was decreased (stimulation index of 23.2 compared to 85.6 in healthy control). Mild splenomegaly (8.5 cm) was confirmed on abdominal ultrasound. The CT scan showed small bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Blood serology and PCR for EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative. The patient was treated with weekly subcutaneous immunoglobulin (scIg) injection therapy (equivalent to 0.65 g/kg/month). At 5 years of age, he suffered from two consecutive pneumonias with the second episode associated with rhinovirus infection, which required hospitalization and oxygen supplementation. Among other relevant medical problems, he is known for mild bilateral conductive hearing loss and atopy IgE-mediated milk allergy (milk specific IgE: 9.95 IU/L and positive skin prick test to cow\\'s milk extract at 2 years old) and allergic rhinitis to birch and cat.\\nThe family reported that parents were not related and were of Caucasian origin (Figure 1A). The father (Patient III.1, 29 years old) was investigated as a child for splenomegaly, atopic dermatitis, mild intermittent asthma, molluscum contagiosum (on buttocks, legs, and arms from age 1-5 years old) and \"high total B-cell number.\" No diagnosis was established at the time. Over the years, he developed recurrent warts and persistent finger onychomycosis (since age 4-5). He had chickenpox at 11 years old followed by shingles as a young adult. More recently, he was treated with intravenous antibiotic for recurrent knee effusions and recurrent folliculitis of the forearms and thighs. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated on the initial bacterial culture. Further immunological investigations revealed a polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (absolute lymphocyte count of 3.4 x 109/L with 33.0% of circulating CD19+ B-cells). B-cell subpopulation analysis also demonstrated an increased proportion of naive CD19+sIgM+ B-cells (7.9 x 108/L, 74.0%) and CD19+CD5+ B-cells (5.3 x 108/L, 50.0%), while the proportion of class-switched CD19+CD27+IgD-memory B-cells (0.1 x 108/L, 1.0%) was severely decreased. The father had a mild decrease in serum IgM level (0.48 g/L), but otherwise normal serum immunoglobulins (IgG 12.7 g/L, IgA 1.8 g/L, IgE 37-107 mug/L) and specific antibody responses against tetanus (0.9 IU/mL), diphtheria (0.6 IU/mL), and Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB, 1.9 mug/mL) post vaccination. The specific humoral response against polysaccharide antigens was suboptimal with < 50% of pneumococcal serotypes above 1.3 mug/mL despite Pneumovax booster. Numbers and proportions of peripheral blood T and NK cells populations were within normal range for age. Lymphocyte mitogen proliferation assays were also normal. The father was closely monitored for the occurrence of possible lymphoproliferative disorder; he had persistently positive EBV PCR (46 774 copies/mL, EBV VCA positive >=1/4000, EBV EBNA < 1/10) with enlarged axillary lymph nodes (up to 1.7 x 1.2 cm on the left size) and prominent fluorodeoxyglucose activity on PET-CT scan. His spleen size was at the upper limit of normal (13.3 cm). He was treated with frequent boosters of conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (e.g., Prevnar-13) and use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy was considered by the medical team.\\nThe grandmother (II.1) reported frequent otitis externa and colds as a child. As an adult she had two pneumonias and two episodes of shingles, and was treated for Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma (2A, mixed cellularity) at 33 years old. She has allergic rhinitis to dust and molds, frequent rhinosinusitis, persistent warts, and persistent onychomycosis. The great-grandmother (Patient I.1, 78 years old) suffered from recurrent warts, shingles and sinusitis over the years. A clinical evaluation was offered to the great grandmother at MUHC but never performed. The index patient, father and grandmother were subsequently evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center in 2015 and again in 2017. On physical exam, warts were noted on the index patient (one on toe) and father (multiple on hands). The most recent flow cytometric evaluation of PBMC confirmed expansion of naive and immature B cells in the index patient, with few class-switched memory B cells detected (Table 1). The same pattern was evident in the father and grandmother, although circulating B cell counts decreased inversely with age. PCR indicated moderate EBV viremia in both father and grandmother (3.13 and 4.45 Log10 IU/ml). Serum IgE levels were slightly elevated in the index patient; otherwise total immunoglobulin levels were normal for all subjects. For the father, random antibody titers against rubella, measles, and VZV were normal, but absent against mumps. The grandmother showed normal antibody titers to measles, rubella, mump, tetanus and HIB, with poor responses to Pneumovax (5/23 serotypes detected).\\nAffected patients displayed multiple clinical hallmarks of B cell Expansion with NF-kappaB and T cell Anergy (BENTA) disease, including (a) splenomegaly, (b) polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis, featuring elevated naive/immature B cells with few class-switched memory B cells, (c) poor responses to pneumococcal vaccines, (d) bacterial/viral infections including pneumonias, molluscum contagiosium/warts, and moderate EBV viremia. Because BENTA is caused by gain-of-function (GOF) variants in the lymphocyte scaffold molecule CARD11, we focused on CARD11 as a potential candidate gene. Sanger sequencing was first performed on genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the index patient (IV.1) and his father (III.1). This analysis revealed a heterozygous four amino acid deletion and missense mutation within exon 5 of CARD11 (NM_032415.3 c.701_713delinsT, p.His234_Lys238delinsLeu, hereafter referred to as H234LDelta235-8) (Figures 1B,C). The grandmother and great-grandmother were later confirmed to carry the same pathological mutation (Figure 1B). A CARD11 expression plasmid of this variant was constructed and expressed in a variant of the Jurkat human T cell line (JPM50.6) that lacks endogenous CARD11 expression and harbors an NF-kappaB-driven green fluorescent protein reporter (GFP). Similar to a confirmed gain-of-function (GOF) CARD11 mutation (E134G), H234LDelta235-8 induced constitutive NF-kappaB activation in unstimulated cells, increasing slightly upon TCR/CD28 crosslinking (Figures 2A,B). However, unlike E134G, co-expression of H234LDelta235-8 with WT CARD11 sharply reduced constitutive NF-kappaB activity. Strikingly, H234LDelta235-8 also significantly reduced WT CARD11-dependent NF-kappaB activation following TCR/CD28 stimulation (Figure 2B). Protein expression of WT, E134G and H234LDelta235-8 CARD11 were similar in transfected cells (Figure 2C). Co-immunoprecipitations in WT Jurkat transfectants revealed a substantial reduction of total CARD11 association with BCL10 and MALT1 following stimulation in the presence of H234LDelta235-8 but not WT or E134G CARD11 (Figure 2D). This decrease in CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex formation was comparable, but slightly less pronounced, than that noted with a bona fide dominant negative (DN) CARD11 variant R47H. Moreover, FLAG-tagged CARD11 variants co-precipitated with WT GFP-tagged CARD11 when co-expressed in JPM50.6 cells, indicating WT CARD11 can directly associate with mutant CARD11 protein regardless of stimulation (Figure 2E). Taken together, these results suggest the H234LDelta235-8 CARD11 mutant can disrupt normal activation-induced CBM complex assembly and NF-kappaB signaling in T cells through DN interference. Similar to other patients harboring CARD11 DN variants, we also observed marked defects in NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation and IkappaBalpha degradation in stimulated primary CD4+ T cells from patients III.1 and IV.1 relative to healthy control subjects (Figure 2F).\\nAt baseline, the patient (IV.1) and his father (III.1) showed marked B-cell lymphocytosis: 51.6% and 44.5%, respectively, of their PBMC were CD19+ B-cells, compared to 13.8% for the patient\\'s mother (healthy control, HC) and 10.2 +- 4.4% for a reference cohort. The majority were naive IgM+IgD+ B-cells (IV.1 74.9%, III.1 52.1%, HC 8.4%). To assess in vitro B-cell differentiation, PBMC (1 x 106/mL) were cultured for 7 days with anti-CD40 (1 mug/mL), IL-4 (200 U/mL), and IL-21 (50 ng/mL) at 1 x 106 PBMC/mL in complete medium [RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 15 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin]. IL-21 promotes B-cell differentiation into class-switched (CS) memory and antibody-secreting plasma cells in the presence of CD40 signaling, and IL-4 enhances these effects. Cells from patient (IV.1) and father (III.1) not only displayed poor short-lived plasma cell differentiation (Figure 3A, top panel) compared to the healthy mother (IV.1 0.6%, III.1 2.4%, HC 12.1%), but also decreased CD27+ memory B-cell differentiation including IgM- CD27+ CS memory B-cells (IV.1 2.4%, III.1 4.4%, HC 20%) (Figure 3A, bottom panel). B cell differentiation phenotypes were quantified in Figure 3B. These results were associated with marked decreases in production of IgM (IV.1 0.2 mg/L, III.1 0.4 mg/L, HC 3.7 mg/L), IgA (IV.1 0.0 mg/L, III.1 0.1 mg/L, HC 1.7 mg/L), and IgG (IV.1 0.4 mg/L, III.1 2.1 mg/L, HC 6.5 mg/L) (Figure 3C). Purified T cells from affected family members showed impaired proliferation in response to anti-CD3/CD28 Ab stimulation in vitro, which was largely rescued by more robust stimuli (Ab crosslinking or Ab-conjugated beads) (Figures 3D,E). Nevertheless, patient T cells secreted less IL-2 in response to all stimuli (Figure 3F, Supplementary Figure 2). These results are consistent with previous work demonstrating that BENTA patient B-cells exhibit intrinsic differentiation defects despite enhanced survival in vitro, whereas T cells from both BENTA (CARD11 GOF) and CARD11 DN patients are hyporesponsive in vitro.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"We report a 14-year-old male patient who has experienced progressive gait disturbance characterized by difficulty in maintaining balance since the age of 4 years. He is the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous Chinese parents with no family history of gait disorders. The boy was referred to have had normal development until 4 years of age, when parents started noticing unsteady gait with frequent falling down, cognitive, and speech worsening. At age 7 years he presented ataxia increasing with effort, dysarthria, gait disorders, slowness, learning difficulties, exercise intolerance and fatigue needing to rest. The boy at the age of 10 years was admitted for his first neurological examination, which revealed markedly cerebellar syndrome with gait ataxia and dysarthria attention, and mild cognitive and executive function decline. Physical examination revealed pes cavus, but no scoliosis or other musculoskeletal deformities. Deep tendon reflexes of the lower extremities were disappeared and the plantar response was flexor bilaterally. Light touch, pinprick, and vibration sensation were absent, and the Romberg test was positive. Neurological examination was characterized by gait imbalance and absence of dystonia, chorea, tremor and dyskinesia (Supplementary Video 1). His extraocular range of motion was adequate in all directions, with no apparent OMA on reflex saccade examination. The boy at the age of 14 was screened by a trained neurologist and were noted a mild cognitive impairment. The clinical manifestations were consistent with AOA1.\\nBiomedical tests for ceruloplasmin, serum immunoglobulin, alpha-fetoprotein, ferritin, urethane lactate, pyruvate, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, hemoglobin, vitamin E and B12 were performed. No results were abnormal except for hypoalbuminemia (30.5 g/L, normal range 40-55 g/L) and mildly elevated cholesterol (6.1 mmol/L, normal range <5.2 mmol/L). Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was normal. The patient's visual evoked potentials were abnormal in low-amplitude responses on binocular and monocular tests, although it was not appreciated on history or physical examination. Nerve conduction study showed reduced nerve conduction velocities and low sensory and motor action potentials indicating sensorimotor axonal polymorphic peripheral nerve damage. The lower extremity muscles were biopsied, and histological analysis showed that the size of muscle fibers varied slightly, showing neurogenic pathological changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed atrophy of the cerebellum with no involvement of the brainstem or cerebral cortex, and low signal loss in the cerebellar dentate nucleus on sensitivity-weighted imaging (SWI) (Figure 1). MRI scan was evaluated by an experienced radiologist. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents for publication and accompanying images.\\nGiven the tentative diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia, genetic evaluations for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, 36), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and the autosomal recessive ataxias Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) were performed and shown to be negative.\\nWe then performed WES to identify the genetic lesions responsible for the disease phenotype of the proband. The main part of WES was provided by the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute (Beijing, China). The exomes were captured using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kits (Agilent Technologies, Sta Clara, CA, USA), and high-throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq X-10 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The basic bioinformatics analysis including Reads, Mapping, Variant detection, Filtering, and Annotation were also endowed by Novogene Bioinformatics Institute. The strategies of data filtering refer to Figure 2. Sanger sequencing was applied to validate the candidate variants identified in whole-exome sequencing. Cosegregation analysis was conducted in all family members of this study. The primers were as follows: c.739C>T (forward: 5'-AAGTCAGGCAGAGAGGTGGA-3', reverse: 5'-CGTTACCATTGGCTGGTCTT-3'); c.501dupG (forward: 5'- CAAGGCAGAGGGGATATTCA-3',reverse: 5'- GAGGCAGGAGAATCACTTCG-3'), and the sequences of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were determined using the ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (ABI, Foster City, CA).\\nAfter data filtering, a nonsense mutation in exon 7 (c.739C >T; p.Arg247*) and a frameshift mutation in exon 6 (c.501dupG; p.Ser168Glufs*19) were identified by using WES,and they were co-segregated with the affected members (Figure 3). The patient's father carried a single heterozygous mutation (c.501dupG), and his mother carried a single heterozygous mutation (c.739C>T). Mutation in APTX c.501dupG, which has not been reported previously, located at Chr9:32,986,011(Exon 6).\\nCurrently, the patient has accepted medicine (Idebenone20 mg daily and CoQ10 30 mg daily) and supportive procedures including rehabilitation therapy, and speech therapy. However, the boy experienced no significant clinical improvement following the procedure.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding weighing 510 kg was referred to the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center Large Animal Hospital with a history of acute, severe, non-Weight-bearing lameness of the right front limb. His pain level was severe enough to be mistaken for colic or an acute neurologic event. A physical exam revealed that the gelding was tachycardic at 80 beats per min. He was tachypneic at 44 breathes per min. His rectal temperature was within normal limits at 100.7  Fahrenheit. Colic and neurologic exams revealed no abnormalities in these body systems. Muscle fasciculations of the right triceps brachii muscle were present, and the caudal antebrachium was diffusely firm, with edema present medially from the olecranon to the accessory carpal bone (ACB). Radiographs of the cubital joint, radius, and radiocarpal joint were unremarkable. An ultrasonographic evaluation of the antebrachium revealed increased echogenicity of the superficial digital flexor (SDF) muscle from the musculotendinous junction proximally. There was loss of the normal architecture of the musculotendinous junction of the SDF. The disruption in the tendon fibers was most severe at 23 cm proximal to the ACB where 80% of the SDF muscle fibers were disrupted with loss of regularity and longitudinal orientation. The percentage of damaged fibers decreased but remained abnormal distally to the level of the ACB. The flexor carpi ulnaris muscle had interrupted muscle fibers in approximately 40% of the cross-Sectional area with the severity distributed similarly to the SDF muscle. In addition to fiber pattern disruption, many areas of mixed echogenicity and fluid pocketing were seen, consistent with hemorrhage, in both the SDF muscle and the flexor carpi ulnaris. A diagnosis of traumatic SDF and flexor carpi ulnaris muscle tears was made. The gelding was treated with phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg IV q12 h; VetOne, Boise, ID, USA), and a compression bandage was placed. The lameness remained unchanged following three doses of 4.4 mg/kg phenylbutazone IV every 12 h. Based on recorded findings in the medical record, 36 h after presentation, the gelding was spending more than 50% of the time recumbent.\\nDue to the lack of adequate responsiveness to systemic treatment and the > 50% of time spent recumbent, the decision was made to provide spinal analgesia by epidural morphine treatment. The gelding was sedated with detomidine (0.02 mg/kg IV, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ, USA) for placement of a cervical epidural catheter as previously described. A 20 x 20 cm area to the right of the mane, caudal to the right ear, centered over the first cervical (C1) and second cervical (C2) intervertebral space was clipped and aseptically prepared. Ultrasound was used to localize the space between C1 and C2 and visualize the spinal cord, subarachnoid space, and paraspinal tissues. The skin and musculature deep to the proposed insertion site was locally anesthetized using 5 ml 2% mepivacaine (Carbocaine , Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ). The ultrasound probe (Philips Lumify, C5-2 broadband curved array 2-5-MHz probe) was covered in a sterile plastic shield containing ultrasound transmission gel. A single operator (SDH) then controlled both the ultrasound probe and the 17-gauge 6-inch curve-tipped spinal needle with stylet (Tuohy). Using ultrasound guidance, the Tuohy needle was advanced dorsal to the probe until just adjacent to the dura. The stylet was removed, and 0.9% saline was placed in the hub. Next, the needle was advanced until loss of resistance and a positive hanging drop were observed. The epidural catheter (FlexBlock , 19-gauge, 60 cm, Arrow International Inc., Reading, PA, USA) was then advanced through the spinal needle by a second operator (KH). The Tuohy needle was then withdrawn, removing the stylet of the epidural catheter with it. The first placement attempt was unsuccessful. There was increased resistance to passage of the catheter, and contrast radiography revealed subdural placement. This catheter was removed, and the horse was re-sedated. The second attempt with a new catheter was successfully placed in the epidural space with 6-7 cm of the catheter passed through the Tuohy needle. Correct positioning of the catheter was confirmed based on the loss of resistance, the hanging drop technique, the ability to pass the catheter caudally, and contrast radiography. The epidural catheter was then secured with cyanoacrylate glue at the insertion site, and the external length was sutured to the skin and secured using adhesive dressings.\\nStarting 36 h after the gelding's admission to the hospital, his pain was scored using a composite measure pain scale that has been previously described. This scoring system accounts for weight bearing, head carriage, location within the stall, gross pain behavior, and response to interaction. In addition to epidural morphine, the gelding was maintained on phenylbutazone (2 mg/kg PO every 12 h; VetOne, Boise, ID) for 7 days then 1 mg/kg PO every 12 h for 7 days.\\nPain assessment and scoring were performed four times per day by a board-certified anesthesiologist (KH). The pain scores from just prior to epidural catheter placement until hospital discharge are depicted in detail in Figure 1. Prior to epidural catheter placement, the pain score was at the maximum allowed by the scale at 22. Thirty min following epidural catheter placement, 50 mg morphine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg BW; Henry Schein, Melville, NY, USA) diluted to a total volume of 5 ml with sterile saline was administered. Preservative-free morphine was not available at the time that this case was hospitalized. The morphine was administered with the gelding's head in an elevated position over a 30-min period to promote caudal movement of the epidural drug. The gelding's head remained elevated for 20-30 min following each morphine administration throughout his hospitalization. Twenty-four h after the second treatment, the morphine dose was reduced to 25 mg diluted to 5 ml with sterile saline over 20 min (0.05 mg/kg BW). This resulted in a pain score of 2/22 which increased to 5/22 by 12 h post-Administration; therefore, the same dose was repeated. The pain score remained acceptably low initially; however, by 12 h after the preceding morphine dose, a slight increase in pain was noted (score 5/22) and 25 mg diluted to 5 ml in sterile saline was administered a third time over 30 min. The gelding's time spent recumbent dropped to <10% 6 h after the first morphine dose. Throughout the remainder of the gelding's hospitalization, his pain score remained low (1-2/22) and no further morphine doses were administered. In response to epidural morphine, the heart rate decreased and remained within physiological limits for the remainder of his hospitalization (Figure 2).\\nThe cervical epidural catheter was removed 48 h after the last morphine administration. There was no swelling or discharge from the catheter site while indwelling or following removal while in the hospital. At the 2-month telephone follow-up, the gelding was walking without lameness. The owner confirmed no heat, discharge, swelling, or pain at the insertion site of the catheter.\",\n",

This study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was provided by the subject, a 31-year-old male who had been screened for pre-existing medical conditions, was selected as he suffered from vasovagal pre-syncope during a challenge that comprised induction of isocapnic hypoxia with a target arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 80 %.\\nThe pHOS, described in more detail elsewhere, combines frequency domain (FD) and broadband (BB) components. Changes in chromophore concentration were estimated by using the changes in light attenuation as measured by the BB spectrometer, using the UCLn algorithm to resolve for three chromophores - oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) and oxCCO - between 780 and 900 nm. A fixed differential path length factor (DPF) of 6.26 was used to enable comparison with previous studies. The FD component measured the absolute absorption and scattering coefficients (mua and mus, respectively) at discrete wavelengths 690, 750, 790 and 850 nm, allowing the estimation of DPF at each of these wavelengths using the diffusion approximation. The pHOS optode was placed over the FP1 point on the right side of the forehead.\\nOther monitoring included beat-to-beat SpO2, continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography was used to measure middle cerebral artery flow velocity (Vmca), insonating through the right temporal window, ipsilateral to pHOS monitoring. Estimated relative cerebral oxygen delivery (ecDO2) was calculated as the product of changes in SpO2 and Vmca (relative to their initial values). Synchronization between the pHOS and other monitors was performed by means of a signal voltage output by the frequency domain spectrometer for the length of recording; all data were resampled to a sample period of 3.2 s across the length of recording. Twenty-second data windows were selected for the reporting of summary data. Changes in hemoglobin species concentration are expressed as total hemoglobin ( [HbT] =  [HbO2] +  [HHb]) and hemoglobin difference ( [HbDiff] =  [HbO2] -  [HHb]).

       "    'case_text': \"The patient, a 38-year-old Chinese female, presented to the general surgical outpatients clinic with a 18-month history of intermittent right upper abdominal pain, back pain, nausea and vomiting. The examination of the patient's medical history revealed good general health, absence of systemic diseases, and smoking habit. The physical examination was normal. These symptoms were not decreased in patient treated with oral acid-inhibitory drug and cholagogue at the local hospital.\\nUltrasound of the abdomen showed a retroperitoneal tumor measuring 4.8 x 2.3 cm (Figure 1). To further confirm the diagnosis, Abdominal contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a retroperitoneal mass 34 mm x 27 mm in size, near right renal veins extending to inferior vena cava, and it was pushing the pancreas forward (Figure 2). Abdominal contrast enhanced CT did not reveal any evidence of retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes. The border between the tumor and IVC was indistinct at the arterial phase, the venous phase and the delayed phase (Figure 2). To determine the primary site of the tumor and whether metastasis had occurred, The patients' complete examination included head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest CT and cardiac ultrasound. The patient refused to undergo PET-CT due to financial constraints. The cardiac ultrasound and brain MRI were normal. The CT scan of the chest showed a tumor in the lingual segment of the upper lobe of the left lung, consisting of ground-glass nodules with unclear boundaries; The tumor was approximately 1.3 cm x 1.1 cm in size and multiple short burls can be seen around the edges of the tumor. There were no enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (Figure 3). Bronchoscopy was performed to clarify the nature of the tumor, showing acute inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. Pulmonary tumor may be metastases of inferior vena cava tumors, primary lung cancer or benign pulmonary nodules. Therefore, the patient was discussed in the multidisciplinary tumor board meeting to determine the best treatment strategy. Discussion the results suggest surgery as the only effective treatment for inferior vena cava tumors and pulmonary tumor. The patient first underwent resection of IVC sarcoma. And 1 month later, the patient underwent wedge resection of pulmonary by thoracoscope without preoperative pulmonary biopsy.\\nThe patient underwent resection of IVC sarcoma, which was located at the confluence of the renal vein into the inferior vena cava. After the proximal and distal clamp, the tumor and the involved IVC were completely removed from the infrahepatic IVC to just above the right renal vein. In order to save operation time, the inferior vena cava was reconstructed with artificial blood vessels. Blood loss was around 400 ml during the operation. Post operatively, patient made a good recovery without serious complications.\\nThe postoperative pathological specimens showed that the size of the tumor was 6 x 4 x 3 cm, which was lobulated, the capsule was intact, and there was no metastasis in the surrounding lymph nodes. The histopathological examination showed a well-circumscribed mass composed of spindle cells arranged in interlaced and bundles (Figure 4). The tumor cells are fusiform, slender and rich in cytoplasm. The nucleus is deeply stained, the end is blunt, located in the center, with a certain degree of heteromorphism and pleomorphism (Figure 4). A few fused nuclei were also seen. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the tumor to be positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA), myoglobin, desmin, Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA), Transducin-Like Enhancer of split 1 (TLE-1), h-caldesmon, vimentin, CD99 and Ki-67:40%, and negative for CD 117, CKp, CK7, Bcl-2, S100, CD31, CD34, Dog-1 and STAT-6. These findings support the diagnosis of IVC sarcoma.\\nAfter 1 month, the patient underwent thoracoscopic wedge resection of the upper lobe of left lung. The lung tissues 20 mm from the edge of the nodule, including the nodule, was removed with a linear cutting closure device. There were no obvious blood loss and complications during or after the operation. Blood loss was around 50 ml during the operation. Post operatively, patient made a good recovery without serious complications.\\nGrossly, the resected lung tissue was approximately 6 x 4 x 3 cm in size with an solid mass measuring 0.8 x 0.8 cm in the central area. Patient underwent pathologically confirmed complete anatomical resection of the primary tumor, therefore the surgical margin was >2 cm. There were no enlarged or suspected lymph nodes in the mediastinum during the operation, so mediastinal lymph node dissection was not performed. The histopathological examination of the excised mass showed lung adenocarcinoma (Figure 5). Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells revealed positive expression for CK7, napsin A, TTF-1 and Ki-67:20%, and negative expression for CK5/6, p63, p40, Syn, CgA, CD56 and LCA. Cells from a squamous cell carcinoma are generally CK5/6, p40 and P63 positive and TTF-1 and Napsin A negative whereas adenocarcinoma cells are generally CK7, Napsin A and TTF-1 positive while being negative for p40 and CK5/6. In addition, the patient's lung tissue specimens were consulted by pathologists in Fudan University Cancer Hospital and Gansu Cancer Hospital, and the pathologists of the two hospitals agreed on the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient received gefitinib tablets (250 mg per day) as a maintenance therapy during the perioperative period. Follow-up based on patient's recent medical history, chest and abdominal physical examination, complete blood count, liver function tests, tumor markers monitoring, ultrasound scan of the abdomen every 3 months, CT scans of the lung, abdomen and head every 6 months. 20 months after resection of inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma, the contrast-enhanced CT images show two lump about 1.2 and 0.7 cm in diameter in upper lobe (Figure 6) and lower lobe of the right lung (Figure 7). According to the examination results, it may be metastasis of inferior vena cava sarcoma or recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma. Thoracoscopic wedge resection was performed in patient after the discussion by thoracic surgery department. The immunohistochemical results of postoperative specimens were consistent with the metastasis of inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma (Figure 8). Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells revealed positive expression for SMA, desmin, vimentin and h-caldesmon and Ki-67:70%, and negative expression for CD117, S100, CD34, and Dog-1. Histopathological examination of the right lung mass confirmed the diagnosis of the inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma metastasis. The patient received oral anlotinib treatment (12 mg once daily) after the last operation. The follow-up items are the same as before. During on-going regular follow-up visits no evidence of recurrence or metastasis was observed from December 2020 to October 2021 (Figure 9).\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 42-year-old male, recently diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and a CD-4 count of 35 cells/mm3, presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. During the course of his hospitalization, the patient's abdominal pain and associated symptoms improved, but he became more somnolent and fatigued. He fell twice while ambulating and after the falls reported having occipital headaches without vision changes. There was no other significant change in mental status, but a new right-eye lateral-gaze palsy was identified. The patient denied having any history of visual disturbances and, other than previous gastrointestinal symptoms with weight loss, the review of systems was negative.\\nThe examination most notably identified an afebrile, somnolent patient with the ability to arouse when stimulated, focus on questions, and follow commands. He demonstrated a right sixth-nerve palsy manifested as a lateral-gaze defect in that eye, in conjunction with both horizontal and vertical nystagmus bilaterally. Muscle tone and strength was slightly reduced in all extremities (measuring 4/5 on the Medical Research Council's grading system).\\nDue to the repeated falls and possible brain trauma, a noncontrast CT scan of the head (Figs. 1A and 1B) was obtained and was concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This finding lead to a neurosurgical evaluation with a subsequent CT angiogram of the brain (obtained due to the possible presence of a ruptured aneurysm). The angiogram failed to identify an aneurysm or other source of intracranial bleeding. An external ventricular drain was placed (due to suspicions of hydrocephalus) and allowed for cerebrospinal fluid sampling.\\nThe patient's initial CSF was clear, without xanthochromia, with a white-blood-cell count (WBC) of 2 cells/mm3, red-blood-cell (RBC) count of 73 cells/mm3, and total protein of 5 mg/dL. A second tube's WBC count was 1 cell/mm3, and the RBC count 12 cells/mm3. The CSF culture grew cryptococcus neoformans, with a positive cryptococcal antigen in the blood.\\nThe findings on the CT scan were therefore felt to be consistent with a pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage (PSAH). This is based on the fact that decreasing RBC count between the first and second tube typically indicates a traumatic tap as the source of the red blood cells. The only way to definitively rule out SAH would be to document clear CSF on a repeat lumbar puncture, which was not performed in this instance. We feel strongly, however, that the combination of a decrement in RBC count in the CSF coupled with a lack of xanthochromia, a negative CT angiogram, and a documented infectious explanation for the findings, provides strong and sufficient evidence against SAH as the mechanism for this patient's CT scan findings.\\nThe patient's mental status continued to deteriorate, and an MRI of the brain (Figs. 2A and 2B) suggested rhomboencephalitis with cerebellar swelling contributing to effacement of the fourth ventricle. His intracranial pressure continued to rise uncontrollably, leading to his death.\",\n",

Cerebral angiography showed a superiorly projecting 5.5x3.4x3.7 mm3 aneurysm arising from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) [Figure 2a]. The aneurysm incorporates the origin of the right ophthalmic artery and has a 2.5 mm neck. A left ophthalmic artery aneurysm and bilateral cavernous ICA aneurysms were also found.\\nShe underwent balloon assisted coiling of the right paraophthalmic aneurysm using microvention coils one day after the SAH [Figure 2b]. The right ophthalmic artery remained patent with partial contrast opacification of a loosely packed anteroinferior aneurysm adjacent to the ophthalmic artery origin.\\nAngiography one week post coiling showed severe vasospasm of the bilateral A1s and its distal branches [Figure 3a and b]. The patient was treated with intra-arterial verapamil and nimodipine. Repeat angiography one day later showed ongoing severe stenosis in bilateral A1s and the patient was again treated with intra-arterial vasodilators with improvement in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) vessel caliber and perfusion to the ACA territory. She remained clinically stable with ongoing mild left hemiparesis post-procedure.\\nThree weeks after the intra-arterial treatment, the patient became hemodynamically unstable and developed a right sided hemiparesis. CT scan showed evolution of the left acute SDH into a chronic SDH with mass effect. She underwent an uneventful burr hole evacuation of the left SDH with resolution of her right-sided hemiparesis.\\nHer post-treatment course was complicated by vasospasm requiring two take backs for endovascular intra-arterial treatment and evacuation of the left SDH. CT one month after admission showed a new 27x25 mm2 low density area in the right posterior frontal lobe suggestive of ischemia. She remained a febrile with no signs of meningism, however, developed worsening left-sided hemiparesis and confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed significant enhancement around the coil mass and multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes with surrounding edema [Figure 4a-c]. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed a small anterior protrusion into the supraophthalmic portion of the right ICA.\\nIntra-arterial blood distal to the coils was obtained for culture. Attempted biopsy of the emboli was abandoned after post sampling angiography showed a filling defect at the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation. Repeat right ICA angiography showed clearance at the MCA bifurcation with migration of the thrombus to a single M2/M3 branch. Thrombectomy was not attempted because of the risks of hemorrhage in the setting of possible infective arteritis. Peripheral and intra-arterial blood cultures were negative.

She was commenced on dexamethasone and intravenous vancomycin 1g BD, ceftriaxone 2g BD, and fluconazole 400 mg. Tissue biopsy was not taken in light of antibiotic commencement and the likelihood of obtaining a sterile sample.\\nOne month after the commencement of antimicrobial therapy, MRI brain demonstrated resolution of many of the enhancing foci with significant decrease in the size of the surrounding vasogenic edema [Figure 4d-f] despite corticosteroids being ceased two weeks prior.

The CT revealed a mass with elevation of tissue fascia and free air near the cecum (Figure 1A). Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with perforation of the cecal diverticulum, and open drainage and construction of ileostomy was performed. After 3 months, the patient received right hemicolectomy and closure of the ileostomy. We did not detect the mass from the resected specimen (Figure 1B), and pathological examination revealed no malignancy.\\nThe patient experienced a palpable mass in the left abdomen from May 2017 and attended our department in December 2017. The enhanced CT revealed a 38-mm mass, resembling a dyeing ring in the left rectus abdominis muscle. The mass was located near the scar of ileostomy closure (Figure 2). The size of hernia orifice from the epigastrium to the pubic bones was approximately 20 cm.\\nAfter 4 months, the MRI revealed a 40-mm mass in the left rectus abdominis muscle. T2 weighted image showed a low intensity area similar to muscle (Figure 3A), and the tumor was uniformly enhanced (Figure 3B).\\nWe performed endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration of the mass and reached the pathological diagnosis of desmoid tumor. Because the patient had pain at the mass and at the point of abdominal incisional hernia, we planned resection of the abdominal desmoid tumor and repair of incisional hernia.\\nWe performed a midline incision similar to the previous scar and cut a spindle shape around the mass at 2-cm margin from the mass (Figure 4A). There was no exposure of the tumor at the abdominal side. We used the Harmonic ScalpelTM (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati) to cut the muscle to prevent bleeding (Figure 4B). Next, we removed the rectus abdominis muscle from the left lateral end. The abdominal wall defect measured 10 cm x 10 cm (Figure 4C). The hernia was repaired with a simple closure using anterior layer of rectus sheath and the defect was closed by suturing the right anterior layer of rectus sheath to the left aponeurosis of external oblique muscle (Figure 4D). Considering the risk of recurrence of abdominal wall hernia at the defect site, we decided to repair the defect with autologous fascia. We used a fascia lata patch measuring 15 cm x 5 cm (Figure 4E) to repair the defect in the left abdomen (Figures 4F and 5A-C).\\nThe size of the mass was 45 mm x 45 mm, and it was a solid tumor. The macroscopic view of the resected tumor revealed its whitish color (Figure 6A). Pathological analysis revealed the growth of fibroblasts, defect of the nuclear heteromorphism, and presence of abundant collagen fibers between fibroblasts (Figure 6B). Additionally, a nuclear-positive image of beta-catenin was observed on immunostaining (Figure 6C). The pathological diagnosis was desmoid-type fibromatosis. No recurrence of incisional hernia and desmoid tumor was detected 22 months after surgery.',\n",

In the right eye, there were no keratic precipitates and the anterior chamber was quiet with no cells or flare. Vitreous cavity was quiet and clear. Clinically, evident exudative retinal detachment was visible on dilated fundus exam and documented with optical coherence tomography (OCT). The exudative retinal detachment included the macula with deep creamy yellow choroidal infiltrates adjacent to an old chorioretinal scar along the superior temporal arches. The left eye was unremarkable. Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography revealed two areas of early hypofluorescence at the choroidal level, which persisted to the final phase with surrounding hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography.

His cognitive state declined, and he was unable to perform job duties due to memory loss. At 11 months after onset, the patient became withdrawn, and more deterioration of his cognitive function was observed, indicated by the difficulty in calculating, being lost at home, and frequently forgetting the names of acquaintances. Besides, the tremors spread to bilateral limbs, which led to difficulty in cake decoration (the patient's profession). After 16 months of onset, he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was prescribed sertraline, fluphenazine, and piracetam. At 17 months after onset, he was scored 20 of 30 on the Chinese Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and 15 of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA Beijing Version). The Hamilton's Depression Scale was 7. At 19 months after onset, he developed hallucinations, which made him see his sons as enemies, and occasionally, he protected himself via aggressive behaviors.\\nIn the clinic, the diagnosis of possible behavioral variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD) was considered because of the abnormal neuropsychological profile, such as early apathy and executive/gene deficits with relative sparing of memory and visuospatial functions.\\nA thorough neurological examination 20 months after the onset revealed a total deterioration of the cognitive state, dysarthria, slight hypermyotonia, and deep tendon hyperreflexias in the bilateral limbs, and the patient presented cogwheel-like rigidity. He had difficulty finishing the finger-to-nose test and heel-knee-tibia test due to tremors in his limbs. The patient was unsteady when walking on a straight line. No involuntary movement was observed. He scored 15 of 30 on the Chinese MMSE, and 9 of 30 on the MoCA Beijing Version. The Hamilton's Depression Scale was 7.\\nTo our surprise, the brain MRI demonstrated abnormal intensities in the bilateral caudate nucleus, putamen, and cerebral cortex. A series of laboratory examinations were performed for the rapidly progressive early-onset dementia. The autoimmune screening and tumor marker identification were shown to be unremarkable or negative. An extensive panel for paraneoplastic antibodies including Amphiphysin, CV2, PNMA2 (Ma2/Ta), Ri, Yo, Hu, titin, SOX1, recoverin, zic4, GAD65, and Tr (DNER) were tested, and all were negative. Serology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests for HIV, cryptococcus, syphilis, tuberculosis, bacteria, fungus, and virus showed no evidence of inflammation. In addition, CSF 14-3-3 protein was tested to be negative. RT-QuIC tests of skin and CSF were also negative (Figure 2).\\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences displayed restricted diffusion in the bilateral frontal and parietal cortex (Figures 3A-D). DWI hyperintensities were revealed in the bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral pulvinar, and dorsomedial thalamus (Figures 3E-J). Fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) exhibited hypometabolism in the bilateral cerebral cortex and right basal ganglia (Figure 4).\\nAn empiric course of pulse IV gamma globulin was tried without notable improvement.\\nAt 22 months after onset, the hypermyotonia of the patient in the bilateral limbs became more obvious. He had occasional urinary incontinence, and his ability to study was relatively reserved when he scored 21 of 30 on the Chinese MMSE. The MRC Scale score was 13 of 20. The Hamilton's Depression Scale was 6. EEG showed diffuse slow waves. MRI scanning indicated no obvious change compared to images 2 months earlier.\\nA follow-up study with the MRC Scale revealed gradually developed aphasia, gait disorder, and fecal incontinence 30 months after onset. The patient is still alive, 4 years after the onset, while the MRC Scale score was 2 of 20, and his swallowing function and mobility were still preserved (Table 1).\\nThe clinical features indicated that the patient might have prion disease. To determine the etiology of the disease, we extracted genome DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes of the patient and performed a direct DNA sequencing of the PRNP coding sequence. Unexpectedly, a rare mutation of G114V and 1-OPRD of the PrP in the patient was identified (Figure 5). Given that only a few patients with gCJD were reported to carry the G114V PRNP variant, we suspected that the mutation in the patient might be inherited from his parents, and we, thus, enrolled his immediate family members in this study for a genetic investigation.\\nAlthough the medical record was not available, the maternal grandmother (patient I-2) of the proband was found to have progressive dementia in her 60s, which was within 1 year before her death, and subsequently developed a tremor in her last few months. The proband's mother (carrier II-8) received examination when she was 61 years old, but no neuropsychiatric symptoms were observed. She scored 29 of 30 on the Chinese MMSE and 21 of 30 on the MoCA (Beijing Version). Although the EEG showed slow waves in the left temporal lobe, both cranial MRI (including DWI) and FDG-PET were unremarkable. A follow-up study revealed that she suffered an acute cerebral infarction in the callosum 18 months after the first examination. No cortical ribbon was found by DWI to date (Table 2). Whereas DNA sequencing revealed a G114V mutation and 1-OPRD of PrP in this individual. The elder son of the proband (carrier IV-1) received DNA sequencing at age 10, and G114V mutation and 1-OPRD were also found, although he did not show any clinical symptoms.

Screening for Cryptococcus and TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes) was negative. Lumbar puncture is thought to be unsafe in view of increased intra-cranial pressure.\\nThe patient underwent diagnostic brain biopsy. No organism was seen on gram, India ink and acid-fast stains. 24 h later, some whitish dry non-hemolytic colonies were observed on 5% sheep blood agar and chocolate plates. Gram staining of the colonies revealed medium to long beaded, non branching gram-positive rods, which were positive for modified acid-fast stain as well. At this stage and considering the clinical presentation, suspicion of Nocardia or other aerobic Actinomyces was raised. However, 48 h later, the growth looked slightly pinkish with undulating margins. Using API  Coryne strip (BioMerieux SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France), the isolate was identified biochemically as Rhodococcus species. However, as this was inconsistent with morphological observations, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing which matched that of Gordonia sputi. The E-test minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was reported as following (in mug/mL): vancomycin 1.5; ceftrixone 1.5; imipenem 0.023; amikacin 0.19; gentamycin 0.032; meropenem 0.19; ciprofloxacin 0.125.\\nThe patient was empirically begun on meropenem, vancomycin and rifampicin at admission to hospital. In light of antibacterials sensitivity tests, consensus opinion was to continue on this regimen for extended period of at least 4-6 weeks. Anti-retroviral (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir) treatment was started 2 weeks later. Repeated MRI after a month of treatment showed interval resolution of most of the lesions with remaining few lesions in the upper cerebrum with development of right frontal subdural hematoma adjacent to the previously noted large lesion and post-biopsy related changes (Fig. 1: B).\\nThe patient showed slow but apparent clinical improvement and remained clinically stable and afebrile. Unfortunately, after a month of hospitalization he developed progressive shortness of breath, hypoxemia and hypotension and was shifted to ICU with hospital acquired pneumonia. Chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates. Acinetobacter sensitive to colistin was isolated from sputum. Accordingly, colistin was added as well as trial of corticosteroids for possibility of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS).

He also described weight loss, generalized weakness, and an intermittent non-pruritic, non-vesicular rash. The patient's past medical history was significant for hospitalization three years prior for diffuse oral ulcerations, dysphagia, and a wide-spread non-pruritic, keloid-like rash present on his torso and bilateral upper extremities. Nonspecific gastritis and a hiatal hernia were found on endoscopy; no further evaluation was performed and the patient was lost to follow-up. The patient traveled frequently between Haiti and New Jersey and had been a plantation farmer in Haiti since childhood. He worked primarily with vegetable crops, but had exposure to chickens, cows, and pigs. His sexual history was significant for multiple female sexual partners with only occasional condom use. He denied prior history of sexually transmitted diseases. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.\\nOn initial examination the patient was cachectic and appeared chronically ill. Vital signs included a temperature of 37.3  C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16, and blood pressure of 221/105 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. His weight was 42.9 kg with a body mass index of 14.8. He had pronounced bitemporal wasting, bilateral erythema of the forehead and cheeks and diffuse left-sided facial swelling. Multiple 3-5 mm ulcerations were present throughout the oral cavity, including on the hard and soft palates, tongue, and buccal mucosa. There was diffuse oropharyngeal edema and mucosal pallor and dryness. He was breathing comfortably with no stridor or wheezing.

Chest radiographs demonstrated pronounced airway narrowing and neck radiographs severe oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal airway narrowing with subepiglottic stenosis. Computed tomography of the neck was performed and revealed diffuse thickening of the mucosal oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, aryepiglottic folds, piriform sinuses, and true/false vocal cords (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Subsequent evaluation by otolaryngology with laryngoscopy revealed a granular edematous epiglottis, right aryepiglottic fold, and nasal vestibules without evidence of any distinct masses.\\nMalignancy, autoimmune, and infectious etiologies were considered and further diagnostic studies were obtained. HIV antigen/antibody testing, HTLV, HSV, CMV, and RPR antibody tests were negative. His CD4 count was 345 cells/muL (normal 300-1400 cells/muL) with a decreased CD4 percentage of 21.3% (normal 28-57%) and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.35 (normal 1.0-3.6). Histoplasma urine antigen and serum complement fixation antibody were negative. Interferon-gamma release assay (QuantiFERON -TB Gold) was negative. Epstein-Barr virus IgM and IgG were both positive. ANA was positive at a low titer (1:160) with a non-specific pattern. C3 and C4 values were within normal limits. Anti-smith, anti-RNP, anti-SSA/SSB, and C1 esterase inhibitor antibodies were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis was notable for an elevated IgG level of 1964 nmg/dL, of which 30.7% was composed of gamma globulin. His sedimentation rate was 59 mm/h and C-reactive protein was 10 mg/L. Blood cultures, including fungal blood cultures, were negative. Throat cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.\\nOral pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma was considered the leading diagnosis and a biopsy of a labial mucosal ulcer was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy revealed granulomatous mucositis with multinucleated giant cells containing multiple budding yeast forms (Fig. 3) that stained with Grocott's methenamine silver (Fig. 4) and were consistent with histoplasma species. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative. Histoplasma was not recovered from tissue fungal cultures.\\nOn histologic identification of yeast consistent with Histoplasma, therapy with daily intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg daily) was initiated.

The results showed significant thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 48,000 (per/mm3) associated with a normal, neutrophil dominant (75 %) white blood cell count of 7100 (per/mm3) and relatively decreased lymphocytes (14 %). Based on laboratory findings she was admitted to a referral hospital in Tehran for evaluation of severe thrombocytopenia. Upon admission she had a core body temperature of 36.9 C, a 81 bpm pulse rate (PR), a 14/min respiratory rate (RR) and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) of 95 % while breathing room air. No abnormalities were detected during the physical examination and auscultation and chest radiological studies were unremarkable.\\nIn the following laboratory studies, patient's platelet count continued to decline to 16,000 (per/mm3), as shown in Table 1, and a peripheral blood smear (PBS) taken on the 2nd day of admission showed considerable left shift with myeloid predominance and a platelet count of less than 10,000 (per/mm3).\\nAbdominal pelvic sonography was normal without organomegaly and other viral markers including HCV-Ab, HBs-Ag, HBc-IgM and HIV-Ab and serum protein electrophoresis were unremarkable. Given the hematopoetic abnormalities, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was under consideration. Also, considering her high-risk work environment, COVID-19 diagnostic testing was performed and a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19 in a RT-PCR test. The complete blood count (CBC) of the patient was re-checked twice daily and after 1 day of admission the platelet count started to increase slightly (Table 1). The PBS of the 4th day of admission showed no platelet aggregation or giant platelets. Her platelet levels returned to normal by the 5th day of admission at which point she was discharged and with the remission of platelet levels, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was no longer necessary. One-week follow-up revealed a platelet count of 270,000 (per/mm3).\",\n",

He was diagnosed with BS with a type 1 Brugada pattern on an electrocardiogram (ECG) five years ago and has been followed up with a cardiologist regularly. He had no syncope history or family history of sudden cardiac death. In the preoperative examination, all blood tests, including cardiac enzymes, were normal. Chest radiography revealed no active lung or heart disease. The ECG showed a coved V1 pattern, which remained unchanged [Figure 1]. Transthoracic ECG revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers with normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction: 60%) and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy without regional wall motion abnormality. He stopped aspirin five days before surgery but continued beta-blockers and other diabetes medications.\\nThe anesthesiologist planned a peripheral nerve block for surgical anesthesia. In the operating room, ECG, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive blood pressure were monitored throughout the surgery, and a defibrillator was prepared. Initially, blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, heart rate was 68 beats/min, and oxygen saturation was 98%. Oxygen at a rate of 2 L/min was delivered via nasal cannula.\\nPeripheral nerve blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance, and needles with a nerve stimulator were used. Local anesthetic (55 cc) was prepared in aseptic conditions, which included 0.75% ropivacaine (15 cc), 2% lidocaine mixed with 0.3 mL of epinephrine (25 cc) and normal saline (15 cc). The patient was placed in the supine position, and the hip was slightly abducted and externally rotated. The femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, and the obturator nerve were identified by ultrasound. A 22-gauge, 2-inch stimulating needle was advanced to the target nerves and the nerve stimulator was used to localize the nerves by twitching the corresponding muscle. Then, a bolus of local anesthetic was injected for femoral nerve block (20 cc), lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block (5 cc), and obturator nerve block (5 cc). All injection was done slowly with intermittent aspiration. For sciatic nerve block (SNB) and posterior femoral cutaneous nerve block (PFCNB), the patient was laterally positioned and knee was flexed. Both nerves were identified by ultrasound and a 22-gauge, 4-inch stimulating needle was advanced to the target nerves.

The humerus was shortened 2 cm and then fixed with a dynamic compression plate (see figure 1). Definitive arterial, then venous repair was then performed, followed by epineural repair of the major peripheral nerves. All repairs were done primarily with the aid of magnifying loupes. The muscles of the anterior and posterior compartments were repaired. The repairs were protected in an above elbow dorsal plaster for 6 weeks. Postoperative potassium and other electrolytes were found to be normal.

The patient had no family history of epilepsy or autoimmune disease. She experienced her first episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which lasted for over 30 minutes, at the age of 8 years. She was diagnosed as having encephalopathy related to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. She then received intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by a short course of low dose oral prednisolone. No further seizure was noted after the treatment, and the patient was lost to follow-up with no further medical treatment. No personality change or cognitive dysfunction was noted in the intervening years.\\nOne year before her current admission, the patient noticed a progressive decline in confidence, insomnia, and poor memory, leading to difficulties in her interpersonal relationships and academic performance. She suffered from low mood, general fatigue, poor concentration and several somatic complaints such as headaches and extremity weakness. She visited a psychiatric clinic and took bupropion 150mg, and aripiprazole 20mg/day. Three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizure occurred during her depressive periods, which prompted her to seek medical attention. She underwent electroencephalography (EEG) at our pediatric neurology clinic, and the EEG results revealed right centroparietal spikes. She was then administered a regimen of topiramate 200mg/day, and she claimed to have complete remission of her mood and could return to school after treatments.\\nFour months before the current admission, the patient complained of depressed mood, insomnia, poor appetite, poor concentration, and thoughts of helplessness. Moreover, she presented with sudden-onset agitation and self-harm behaviors, such as head banging or arm scratching, which she could not recall afterwards. The episodes occurred 3 times a day and lasted for 10 to 30 minutes each time. An aura involving machine sounds or flashes of light, occasionally preceded the mood and behavioral changes. She was admitted to our pediatric ward under the suspicion of seizure-induced behavioral change. Lamotrigine 10mg/day was added to her existing regimen of topiramate. A comprehensive neurological survey revealed no structural lesion on her brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and no abnormal findings in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, but her 24-hour EEG revealed epileptiform discharges during the mood swings. Immunologic screening showed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA, 1: 1280 speckled) and mildly decreased C3. Thyroid function, ovarian sonography, and tumor markers were within normal range. Surveys for viral infections were all negative. Under the impression of immune-mediated encephalopathy, methylprednisolone pulse therapy 1g/day was administered for 3 days, followed by oral prednisolone. However, her mood remission was only partial, and the involuntary agitation and self-harm behaviors occurred 2 months after discharge. She could not attend school owing to her depression and behaviors. When she later developed Steven-Johnson syndrome, lamotrigine was stopped and was replaced by valproic acid.\\nBecause of her aggravated clinical agitation and self-harm behaviors, the patient was again admitted to our pediatric ward. Prolonged QTc (479ms) was noted during evaluation for chest tightness. EEG revealed paroxysmal focal spikes over the right frontoparietal area. Her serum sample was positive for ANA with a titer of 1:1280, suggesting autoimmune encephalitis. She received topiramate 150mg/day and valproic acid 400mg/day for epilepsy control. She also received fluoxetine 10mg/day and aripiprazole 5mg/day for depression. Further survey for an autoimmune etiology revealed positive serum anti-SSA antibodies (67.2 U/mL), positive serum cryoglobulin IgG, IgM, and positive ANA in her CSF ( Figure 1 ). Anti-Cardiolipin IgG, IgM, ribosome-P, anti-beta2-glycoprotein I IgG, anti-RNP, anti-SMD, MPO, PR3, rheumatic factor, anti-double stranded DNA, C3, and C4 levels were within normal limits, and HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-TPO, anti-THYG, anti-TSHR, anti-HCV levels were all negative. Anti-neuronal autoantibodies including aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies, glutamate acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody, Voltage gated potassium channel (VGKC)-associated protein (CASPR2) antibodies, VGKC-associated protein (LGI1) antibodies, Glutamate receptors (type AMPA1 and AMPA2) antibodies, gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor antibodies, Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) antibodies were all negative. In accordance with her symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, the Schirmer's test was positive (2mm). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed cortical hypometabolism at the bilateral prefrontal, bilateral parietal, and bilateral visual cortices. We assessed her CSF again for anti-SSA antibodies and had a positive finding (0.4 U/mL). The CSF/serum ratio of anti-SSA antibodies (0.006) was three times higher than that of IgG (2.88 mg/dl/1470 mg/dl = 0.002). This result suggested local production of antibodies in the CNS rather than only passive transmission of antibodies from serum. On the basis of patient's clinical symptoms of ocular and oral dryness, positive findings for serum and CSF anti-SSA antibodies, and the Schirmer's test results, SS was diagnosed in accordance with the 2017 ACR-EULAR classification criteria.\\nUnder the impression of SS-related autoimmune encephalitis and QTc prolongation, intravenous methylprednisolone 1g/day was administered for 3 days. The frequency and intensity of agitation decreased from approximately eight times per day to twice a day. After the QTc returned to normal, rituximab 500mg was infused intravenously. She had no further agitation or self-harm behaviors after the treatment of methylprednisolone and rituximab. We kept her antidepressants and antipsychotics and discharged her. She did not exhibit any involuntary agitations during outpatient follow-up. The patient reported an improvement in mood and began to bring life back on track.

At the age of 13 years, she had a posterior spine fusion from C7 to T10.\\nIn her upper limbs, she fractured her right olecranon at the age of 14 years. This fracture was treated by casting. At the age of 16 years, she fractured her right proximal humeral shaft, which was treated by an intramedullary flexible nail. Subsequently, at the age of 23 years, she developed left ulna nerve compression (cubital tunnel syndrome), which was treated by operative decompression and subcutaneous transposition.\\nIn the lower limbs, she had bilateral clubfoot treated by casting. Operative realignment was performed on her right foot at the age of 2 years. At the age of 9 years, she fractured her right femur, which was treated by two intramedullary flexible nails. At the age of 11 years, she refractured the diaphysis of the right femur and bent the intramedullary rod, which required revision with repeat intramedullary flexible nailing. Her left femur was fractured when she was at the age of 12 years; this was treated with two flexible nails. At the age of 14 years, she developed left acetabular protrusio (Figure 3). At the age of 21 years, her right femur was fractured in the diaphysis, which was treated by a locking plate-intramedullary rod construct. The plate was removed when she was at the age of 22 years (Table 1).',\n",

They requested surgical treatment to enlarge their pharyngeal airway. Before surgical treatment, all three patients underwent a complete otorhinolaryngological physical examination that was conducted by a researcher. Body mass index, tonsil size, and palate grade were recorded for analysis. Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Tonsil size and palate grade were evaluated according to the scale proposed by Friedman et al.. All patients were examined with overnight nocturnal polysomnography in our sleep laboratory in the standard manner, and each had an apnea hypopnea index >20 events/hour, indicating moderate-to-severe OSAS.\\nBecause the patients had bilateral large tonsils, the UPPP surgical procedure to enlarge the pharyngeal airway was performed by a sleep surgeon under general anesthesia, according to the originally described technique. The large tonsils were removed bilaterally and the tonsil's weights were measured. All patients tolerated the surgery without complications.\\nBody mass index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score were evaluated both before and 3 months after UPPP. Polysomnography and 3D CT scanning were also performed at both time points. Postoperative polysomnography revealed moderate-to-great improvement in the severity of OSAS (Table 1).\\n3D CT was performed under the same condition before and after UPPP. 3D CT was performed using a 64-row multidetector CT scanner (Brilliance 64 , Phillips, Cleveland, OH, USA) under routine neck examination conditions at the end of inspiration while the patients were holding their breath. Thin axial sections of 0.9 mm thickness at 0.45 mm intervals were obtained to reconstruct multiplanar reformation images and 3D CT images. Multiplanar reformation and 3D CT image reconstructions were performed at an image workstation (Ziostation2, Ziosoft, Tokyo, Japan), which enabled us to visualize and objectively quantify the dimensions and volume of the airway. Axial-view multiplanar reformation images were used for this analysis.

During the next 15 years she had 8 documented relapses which resolved with intravenous glucocorticoid therapy. The relapses decreased in frequency during this time, after which her clinical status deteriorated, with progressive development of quadriparesis, ataxia, fatigue and cognitive decline. In 1994, a trial of interferon beta-1b was discontinued because of increased spasticity, and she was not a candidate for glatiramer. She had no history of diabetes, cardiovascular, liver or kidney disease.\\nWhen seen in 1999 her weight was 29.5 kg, down from 54.5 kg in 1976. She was paraplegic, wheelchair-bound, and exhibited paresis of the upper extremities with OMS (Oxford Muscle Strength) score of 2-3 out of 5 (Table 1) and an EDSS score of 8.0. Neurological presentation included paraplegia, bilateral central scotomata with visual-field loss, dysphagia, chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment similar to mild dementia, and depressed mood. In June 2000, having explained the rationale and risks, she consented to a trial of pioglitazone, which was initiated at 15 mg daily and increased by 15 mg biweekly to 45 mg. Improvement was evident within 4 weeks as increased appetite, cognition and attention span. Her weight increased from 27.3 to 35.9 kg (32%) after 12 months treatment, which was maintained between 34.6 to 36.2 kg throughout an additional 18 months. Weight gain was evident as increased muscle mass and peripheral fat, mainly in the hips, gluteal area, and limbs. Upper extremity strength and coordination progressively improved (Table 1). Improved fine coordination was noted unilaterally after 8 months (left finger-to-nose execution), and bilaterally after 15 months. Before pioglitazone, repetitive statements and forgetfulness, reminiscent of dementia, were problematic. After 8 months therapy, cognitive assessment demonstrated improvement in orientation, short-term memory (recall increased from 0/3 to 2/3 objects), attention span, registration and insight, and is consistent with clinical improvement. According to DSM IV criteria, her depression also improved significantly, along with the progressive gain in weight and improvement in neurological function as a whole. She was progressively able to tolerate outdoor social activities for several hours at a time, with improved stamina and well-being.\\nDuring the study, two MRI studies with gadolinium (Gd) were performed, one 18 months after initiation of pioglitazone and the second 10 months later (Figure 1). There was no perceptible change in overall brain atrophy, extent of demyelination, or in Gd-enhancement indicating that at least over the 10 months between the MRI studies, the disease was quiescent. This also suggests that the beneficial effects of pioglitazone treatment were not associated with any overt improvement in pathology. After 3 years on pioglitazone, she continues to be clinically stable. There have been no adverse events, and her metabolic profile has remained normal throughout the study.',\n",

Prior to that, he had visited a series of other facilities and had an open biopsy, done in another facility, which had already confirmed the diagnosis of PVNS. There was no history of injury or trauma, and his past medical history was uneventful.\\nPhysical examination showed a healed scar from the open biopsy on the extensor side of his left elbow. The range of motion was restricted from 5 degrees of extension to only 90 degrees of flexion, (FE: 90.5.0), in comparison to the contralateral side with 0-degree extension to 140-degree flexion (FE: 140.0.0). Pronation and supination were free, he did not have any signs of ligament instability, and his neurovascular status was normal.\\nRadiographs were normal, and MRI revealed a soft tissue tumor in the anterior joint compartment with extension to the olecranon fossa and the radiocapitellar joint, with the signal intensity consistent with PVNS. There were no osteolytic lesions or osseous erosions visible on MRI.\\nAs the suspected diagnosis of PVNS was already confirmed via biopsy, elbow arthroscopy, tumor excision, and synovectomy were indicated.\\nUnder general anaesthesia, the patient was positioned in prone position with the left elbow supported and free for mobilisation. Tourniquet was not used. Under routine antibiotic coverage and surgical site preparation, anteromedial, anterolateral, posterolateral, and posterior portals were established. The anterior compartment was addressed first. Arthroscopic exploration showed a large soft tissue tumor, exactly as the MRI demonstrated, with the typical appearance of a nodular form of PVNS (Figure 1). The synovium showed a diffuse form of PVNS. Firstly, we removed the tumor-like nodules, followed by total synovectomy, which was performed with an arthroscopic shaver and with a radio frequency ablation device to keep bleeding to a minimum. The joint cartilage showed grade 2 changes on the distal humerus as well as on the radial head. The annular ligament was intact. After the anterior compartment was finished, the posterior compartment was addressed in a similar manner. There was some scar tissue which needed to be debrided first due to the open biopsy that had been done previously. Then, a total synovectomy was performed in the same way as for the anterior compartment. A drain was put in the anterior compartment, the wounds were closed, and the arm was immobilised in a sling for comfort.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful; rehabilitation was initiated in the first week after a few days of rest, focusing on gain of passive and active range of motion. The patient presented with a little pain but showed local swelling that persisted for two weeks. Range of motion was near normal at the end of the sixth week postoperatively (Figure 2). At the most recent follow-up six months postoperatively, the patient was pain free and had regained full range of motion, and the follow-up MRI did not reveal any recurrence (Figure 3).',\n",

Although a Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) was recommended at 8-month follow-up, the family declined this study and the patient was lost to follow-up.\\nSixteen years after surgery, at the age of 24, the patient developed daily headaches associated with nausea and dizziness that progressed over a 2-month period. Upon consultation in another institution, neurological examination revealed left homonymous hemianopsia and mild (4+/5) motor weakness of the left lower extremity. She was otherwise neurologically intact. CT angiography revealed a recurrence of the right occipital AVM fed by MCA branches and draining into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) [Figure 5]. The patient was referred to our center where, on August 24, 2011, a DSA confirmed the right occipital AVM [Figure 6a and b]. The patient underwent an uneventful second microsurgical resection of the occipital AVM recurrence through a right occipital craniotomy using ultrasonographic guidance. Postoperative DSA performed 7 days after surgery showed no evidence of residual AVM [Figure 6c]. Her preoperative symptoms resolved, but her visual deficit was mildly accentuated postoperatively. The postoperative course was otherwise uneventful and she remains stable at 5-week follow-up.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'Sylvia was a 34 year old woman who was referred to the Helen Dowling Institute, a mental healthcare institute for psycho-oncology. She suffered from severe fatigue (score of 49, which is way above the severe fatigue cut-off of >=35 on Checklist Individual Strength - Fatigue Severity subscale (Vercoulen et al.,)) for over a year by then. Two years prior she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer with bone metastases. The tumor was removed through surgery. Next, she received four rounds of chemotherapy, followed by two surgeries to remove the affected rib and vertebra. After one year of curative treatment, leading to chemotherapy-induced kidney failure, she received medical follow-up consultations every few months by an oncologist. She also suffered from inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory rheumatism since her teenage years. She lived together with her partner, had a university education, and was fully incapacitated for work since her cancer diagnosis. Previously, she worked fulltime as a project leader.\\nWhile she had always struggled with fatigue due to her comorbidities, throughout her cancer treatment the fatigue worsened dramatically. Sylvia described she had particular trouble concentrating when she felt tired. When she tried to read a newspaper or do her administration, she could get headaches and become nauseous. This severely limited her daily life activities. Her experience of fatigue was rather similar from day to day. Usually, she had trouble starting the day, which usually took her a few hours. Fatigue increased throughout the day, with a dip in the late afternoon. She usually took a nap by then because she was unable to do any of her activities. She did, however, also experience unexpected waves of extreme fatigue that did not seem to be related to previous activities. During those moments, it was difficult to get through the day. Furthermore, when she had a particularly busy activity, for example when she went to a party, she had trouble dealing with all the stimuli and social interactions at once. As a result, she would be extra fatigued for the following two to three days.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 5-year-old, intact male Bengal cat weighing 5.2 kg (body condition score: 3/9) suffered a fracture of the right femur following a motor vehicle accident. A referring veterinary hospital performed surgical fixation using a dynamic compression plate, screws, and cerclage wires. Three weeks after surgery, the cat was presented to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the National Pingtung University of Science and Technology due to the recurrence of non-weight-bearing right hind limb lameness.\\nInitial physical examination revealed pain and instability upon palpation of the right femur with soft tissue swelling. No other physical abnormalities were observed. Radiographic examination revealed a closed, comminuted, mid-diaphyseal fracture of the right femur with notable bone callus formation and implant failure (Figure 1A).\\nThree surgical revisions were performed before the final revision, along with concurrent activity restriction, analgesic medication administration, and low-level laser therapy. During the first revision surgery, the previous implants were removed and the fracture edges were debrided. The fracture was stabilized with a 2.7-mm non-locking reconstruction plate and a 1.6-mm intramedullary (IM) pin. After 2 months, the cat presented with persistent lameness and muscular atrophy of the affected limb on palpation. Radiographic examination indicated 30% femoral shortening and loosening of the four distal screws (Figure 1B). A second revision surgery was performed; the fracture edges were debrided, and an autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the proximal ipsilateral humerus was placed around the fracture. The fracture was stabilized using a longer 2.7-mm plate and a 2.0-mm IM pin. However, 4 months later, the lameness remained unimproved, and radiographs showed delayed union with screw loosening (Figure 1C). Treatment options including femur amputation, type IA external skeletal fixation alone or combined with a tie-in technique, and autograft combined with BMP were discussed with the owner. In the meantime, the loosened reconstruction plate and screws were removed to minimize damage to the surrounding soft tissue and bone in a third revision surgery. The IM pin was left in place according to the owner's request although it provided only minimum bone fracture support. At presentation 11 months later, atrophic non-union of the affected femur was noted (Figure 1D). The owner eventually opted for fracture repair using a structural bone autograft and BMP. The surgical events of this case are shown in the timeline (Figure 2).\\nThe preoperative complete blood count and serum biochemistry results were within normal limits. Fentanyl (5 mug/kg) and cefazolin (22 mg/kg) were administered intravenously as a premedication and prophylactic antibiotic, respectively. General anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol (6 mg/kg) and maintained with 1-2% inhaled isoflurane. Intraoperative analgesia was administered via a constant rate infusion of fentanyl (1.5 mug/kg/h), lidocaine (1.2 mg/kg/h), and ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h). The cat was positioned in left lateral recumbency, and the previous IM pin was removed from the trochanteric fossa. Subsequently, the fracture site was exposed using a lateral approach in a routine manner. When fully exposed, the fracture edges were surrounded by smooth fibrotic tissue and mild callus formation was noted. The fracture edges were debrided with an ultrasonic surgical device (SonoCure, Tokyo Iken Co., Tokyo, Japan) (Figure 3A). The medullary canal was recanalized by drilling a 2.8-mm pin into the canal from the fracture site (Figure 3B). The fractured edges were maximally distracted using bone-holding forceps, although the original bone length could not be restored due to excessive soft tissue tension. An 8-hole, 66-mm, ball-shape reconstruction locking plate (Lisen Tech., Taoyuan City, Taiwan) with six 2.7-mm locking self-tapping cortical screws was used to stabilize the fracture segments; two holes in the middle were left empty. A bone gap of ~1.8 cm was measured in the defect.\\nThe ipsilateral seventh rib was approached by making an incision through the skin and thoracic muscles. The periosteum of the rib was incised to expose the mid-section of the rib body, and it was elevated carefully. A 2-cm segment of the rib was harvested using an ultrasonic scalpel (SonoCure, Tokyo Iken Co., Tokyo, Japan) (Figure 3C). The intercostal muscles were then apposed over the cut edge of the rib with 3-0 polydioxanone suture in a simple interrupted pattern. The length of the graft was chosen to be the length of the fracture gap plus 0.5 mm. The graft was then positioned at the center of the fracture gap with gentle manual impaction (Figure 3D). No additional fixation was performed. Another skin incision was made over the ipsilateral iliac crest. Several pieces of corticocancellous iliac autograft were obtained with a rongeur (Figure 3E) and placed to fill the residual space around the rib graft. Finally, a 3 x5 cm absorbable collagen sponge (SavPet, Oriental Co., Taipei, Taiwan) was soaked in 100 mug of rhBMP-2 (10426-HNAE, Sino Biological, Beijing, China) reconstituted in 0.5 mL of normal saline and wrapped around the bone defect (Figure 3F). Routine closure of the three surgical sites was performed. As the pleura was left intact, a thoracostomy tube was not required. Although the exact range of motion was not measured by a goniometer during surgery, the range of motion of the right stifle was subjectively judged to be about half that of the contralateral side on physical exam before extubation. Postoperative radiographs were obtained to confirm the position of the graft (Figure 4A). Mild distal femoral varus was also noted (Figure 4A). The radiographically measured length of the right femur was ~8.0 cm, and that of the left femur was 12.1 cm (~34% shortening).\\nAnesthetic recovery was uneventful. Pain was managed with intravenous tramadol (2 mg/kg) twice a day for 2 days, a single dose of intravenous meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg), and low-level laser therapy on the surgical sites. Intraoperative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria cultures were performed on a sample collected from the bone defect before debridement, and no pathogens were identified. No postoperative complications were observed. The cat was discharged on the fourth postoperative day with an instruction of cage rest.\\nOn the seventh postoperative day, occasional weight-bearing lameness during walking was noticed (lameness score: 4/5). After 2 months, the cat was able to trot with mild lameness at home. On physical examination, the cat was consistently bearing weight on the affected limb with a moderate weight-bearing lameness during walking (lameness score: 3/5) characterized by a decreased swing phase. Radiographs showed bridging callus formation with new bone formation and incorporation of the transplanted rib graft (Figure 4B). On radiographs taken 5 months postoperatively, bony union at the fracture gap was evident and the transplanted rib graft was indiscernible (Figure 4C). Moreover, at the last recheck examination 12 months postoperatively, successful bone remodeling and apparent maturity of the generated bone were noted (Figure 4D). To compensate for the discrepancy in hind limb length, the cat stood with the affected hip, stifle, and hock joints at greater angles of extension. Despite mild lameness during walking (lameness score: 2/5) (see Supplementary Video 1), the cat was energetic and had no difficulty jumping at home. The passive range of motion of the right stifle was also increased but was still about 30% less than contralateral side on physical exam without application of anesthesia or sedation. The owner was satisfied with the improved health status and good ambulatory function.\",\n",

The patient reported being sexually active with men only with the last unprotected sexual intercourse 2 weeks ago. He denied any illicit drug use.\\nIn the emergency department, the patient had a temperature of 38.2  C, a heart rate of 103 beats/minutes, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minutes, blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable with no meningeal signs. Given his headache and a fever of 38.3  C, the patient was started on empiric meningitis treatment with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Computed tomography of the head without contrast showed no acute intracranial process. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without contrast was unremarkable.\\nInitial laboratory findings (Table 1) were significant for leukopenia of 2.2 x 103/microL, thrombocytopenia of 81 x 103/microL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, transaminitis, elevated C-reactive protein of 3.16 mg/dL, and hypoalbuminemia. Chest X-ray did not reveal any active infection or any other pathology. Blood cultures were negative. Lumbar puncture revealed the following: white blood cells 3 cells/cm2, red blood cells 378 cells/cm2, glucose 54 mg/dL, and elevated protein 51 mg/dL. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for cryptococcal antigen, herpes simplex virus, and CSF VDRL. Accordingly, vancomycin was discontinued. Ceftriaxone was decreased to 1 g every 24 hours for 2 weeks, followed by intramuscular benzathine penicillin G 3 million units to treat presumed neurosyphilis due to elevated protein in the CSF. HIV antigen/antibody test was positive, with an HIV-RNA level over 10 000 000 copies/mL, CD4 T-cell count of 201 cells/microL, and CD8 T-cell count of 93 cells/microL. These results along with fatigue, fever, pancytopenia, and transaminitis supported the diagnosis of acute retroviral syndrome; therefore, ART was initiated consisting of darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide.\\nAdditional laboratory values (Tables 1 and 2) showed hyperferritinemia >40 000 ng/mL, D-dimer >5000 ng/dL, bi-cytopenia, transaminitis, and hypertriglyceridemia, which raised concern for HLH. H-score showed a 93% to 96% probability of having HLH (Table 3).

He also has been complaining of pallor, decreased activity and appetite, and weight loss for a month prior to his presentation. A week before his admission, there was a noticeable increase in his pallor. Upon presentation, he was hypoactive, pale, and jaundiced. He was normothermic and hemodynamically stable. System examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly small palpable lymph node in the supraclavicular and inguinal region. The remainder of his physical examination was unremarkable.\\nHis initial Laboratory tests at admission showed a picture of bi-cytopenia in the form of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Platelet 11 x 109/L (normal range: 150-400 x 109/L); hemoglobin 97 mg/L (normal range: 113-150 mg/J); white blood cells 10.2 x 109/L (normal range: 4-12 x 109/L); and reticulocyte counts 2.45% (normal range: 0.5%-1.5%). Peripheral blood smear showed red blood cell fragmentation (Schistocytes) at 1.45%, and white blood cells, mainly neutrophilia, displayed reactive changes in forms of toxic granulation.\\nLactate dehydrogenase was 1,021 U/L (normal range: 125-220 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase 46 IU/L (normal range: 5-34 U/L); alkaline phosphatase 143 IU/L (normal range: 156-369 U/L); total bilirubin 41.3 micromol/L (normal range: ~20.5 micromol/L); and direct bilirubin 12.7 micromol/L (normal range: ~8.6 micromol/L). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed hematuria and hemoglobinuria. Coagulation screening tests were within the normal range; fibrinogen level was decreased to 1.72 g/L (normal range: 1.5-4.1 g/L); Coombs test was negative.\\nInitially, the patient was diagnosed with atypical idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and treated with Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 g/kg. He received two doses of IVIG without response, and his Hgb and platelet counts declined further.\\nIn order to rule out bone marrow infiltration, bone marrow aspirations (BMA) and biopsy were performed. The preliminary report of the BMA did not suggest malignancy; however, it showed megakaryocytes which is suggestive of immune destruction. Therefore the patient was started on a six days trial of pulse steroid therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day divided twice a day), with no improvement in Hgb or platelet count. The final result of BMA revealed peripheral destruction of blood cells, indicating microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), likely TTP, congenital or acquired due to an immune reaction to ADAMTS-13; this diagnosis was supported by repeated peripheral blood smear showing Schistocytes fragments of red blood cells >2.5% (Normal range <1.5%), accordingly a five days trial of fresh frozen plasma transfusion was initiated, in which the patient showed improvement in LDH and platelet levels.\\nIn addition, bone marrow biopsy results showed morphologic evidence of frequent small epithelioid non-necrotizing granuloma. Considering that this is a nonspecific finding that could be attributed to various etiologies, including infections (viral, bacterial, and tuberculosis), infiltrating diseases such as sarcoidosis, and malignancies, further investigation has been pursued. Viral surveillance, including EBV, CMV, and HIV were negative. QuantiFERON-TB Gold was negative. Abdominal ultrasound and computerized chest and abdominal tomography (CT) scan showed splenomegaly with no significant lymph node enlargement. Since Brucella is endemic in Saudi Arabia and the patient had recently consumed a significant amount of unpasteurized goat milk and cheese, brucella titers were sent, and the result showed Brucella abortus 1:5,120 (normal range: <1:160), and Brucella melitensis 1:20,480 (normal range: <1:160).\\nA combination of Doxycycline (5 mg/kg/day orally twice a day) and Rifampin (20 mg/kg/day orally twice a day) antimicrobial therapy was commenced for a total of 6 weeks (42 days) to treat brucellosis. Once starting the anti-brucellosis management, the patient did not require further FFP transfusion. The ADAMTS-13 essay result showed: extremely low ADAMTS-13 activity, which was found at 0.02 IU/ml (normal range: 0.40-1.30 IU/ml), with an antigen assay below the detection level of 0.01 IU/ml (normal range: 0.41-1.41 IU/ml); and anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies were detected at high concentrations of >95 IU/ml (>15 IU/ml is considered positive). All these findings, along with the presentation of thrombocytopenia and hemolysis, are specific to acquired TTP.\\nSeveral days following the commencement of antibiotic therapy, the platelets count and hemoglobin levels recovered to the normal range (Figure 1), while the lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased substantially to a normal level.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"The patient was a 45-year-old female who was admitted to an acute psychiatric hospital with depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and auditory hallucinations. She was discharged five days prior from a different hospital, and according to previous records, has been repeatedly hospitalized within the last 12 months totaling 18 emergency department visits. Her psychiatric history was significant for benzodiazepine use disorder, opiate use disorder, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder. Her medications on admission included clonazepam, clonidine, buprenorphine and naloxone, fluoxetine, gabapentin, and trazodone. Her social history included unemployment and homelessness without family support.\\nDuring the admission, the patient exhibited a wide range of odd behaviors that will be described in the categories of catatonia-like signs, psychotic signs, and seizure-like signs. Catatonia-like signs included (1) a flat affect with psychomotor retardation and fluctuating mutism, (2) complete lack of social contact with other patients for the entirety of the hospital stay, (3) twitching and eye grimacing with shoulder shrugging, (4) posturing and immobility, and (5) diaphoresis. These severe signs persisted throughout her hospital stay and were so convincing of catatonia that multiple attendings, nurses, and staff held special meetings to specifically review her catatonic status. Additional consultants were recruited to discuss her case at length. Furthermore, these catatonic symptoms resulted in the patient's hospital stay lasting almost two months as the appropriate treatment and disposition were considered. Psychotic signs included (1) mouthing words and seemingly responding to internal stimuli, (2) thought blocking, and (3) reported auditory hallucinations. Seizure-like behavior included episodes of jerking head back and forth with her eyes fluttering without tongue biting. She was conversant during the episodes, and when seen by a consultant, her exam was benign.\\nThe signs described above were complicated by subtle clues pointing towards volitional behavior, as confirmed by multiple staff members and psychiatry attendings involved in her care. Her external goals appeared to be to gain access to benzodiazepines as well as to shelter and food. Evidence for this included repeatedly verbalizing that she was withdrawing and needed clonazepam, and selectively choosing only the benzodiazepines, clonidine, and gabapentin from the cup of medications given to her every day while refusing the other medications. Discussion of her case with a relative revealed that she had been overusing her prescription clonazepam and opioids. Throughout her hospital stay, she ate every meal without prompting or interruption from her other behaviors, unusual of catatonia. Furthermore, she was not eager for discharge and appeared to prolong the hospital stay willingly. In terms of her catatonia-like behaviors, the patient would lapse into psychomotor retardation, mutism, and repetitive movements such as grimacing and eye twitching during uncomfortable or uninteresting topics of conversation. She would then lapse out of these actions abruptly and speak lucidly about urgent issues she wanted to vocalize. This was similar to her psychotic symptoms, such as abruptly lapsing in and out of mumbling, mouthing words, and seemingly responding to internal stimuli. The use of risperidone did not seem to alleviate these psychotic behaviors. As for inconsistencies in her seizure-like activity, the patient would often have dramatic seizure events and then suddenly stand up after her seizure episodes and walk independently back to her room to position herself for an expected lorazepam injection. There was one incidence where staff members saw her purposefully pour water onto her pants to feign urinary incontinence during a seizure episode. In some of her more minor automatisms, she would shake and jerk one arm while the other arm would steadily hold onto food and drink without spillage.\\nThe patient's case was discussed at length with all the attending psychiatrists, case managers, and hospital staff who were involved in her care. A catatonia specialist in the region was also consulted, who confirmed that she was likely to not have catatonia. Repeated administration of lorazepam as challenge tests seemed to have a limited effect on her catatonic and other behaviors and would instead seem to reinforce them. After a protracted hospital stay of two months, the patient was discharged to a shelter with proper social supports and psychiatric follow-up. Two and three months after discharge, the patient represented to two different hospitals at different cities for unusual medical concerns and requests for medications, leaving against medical advice each time, once walking out with a peripheral IV still in hand.\",\n",

The biopsy specimen showed superficial perivascular neutrophilic infiltration with leukocytoclastic debris, and interstitial infiltration of a few eosinophils and melanophages, consistent with LCV. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) staining demonstrated granular deposition of immunoglobulin A and C3 in dermal blood vessels (Fig. 2).\\nWe stopped rivaroxaban on July 12 and started dabigatran 110 mg twice a day instead. The skin lesions improved within 2-3 days. We administered rivaroxaban 20 mg daily again from July 19 to confirm that the skin lesions were caused by it. Similar skin lesions developed again on July 29, and rivaroxaban was stopped on July 31. We started dabigatran 110 mg daily again from August 1. The skin lesions improved within 2-3 days again but they began to reappear on August 13. Dermatological assessment performed at that time indicated that this was the same disease. Since the patient was not receiving any concomitant medication that could be suspected as the cause of LCV, we stopped dabigatran on August 15, and started edoxaban 15 mg daily from August 16. The skin lesions improved over several days. We did not administer rivaroxaban and dabigatran anymore, and the skin lesions also did not develop again subsequently. However, the patient developed hospital-acquired pneumonia and died of it on September 11, 2017.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 69-year-old woman presented to the Rheumatology Clinic in January 2010 for evaluation of generalized morphea/localized scleroderma diagnosed 7 months after receiving local radiation to right breast for treatment of breast cancer. In September 2008, breast cancer was diagnosed by needle biopsy when an abnormal cluster of calcifications was identified by a screening mammography in September 2008. After consultation with her surgeon, oncologist, and radiation therapist, she underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The cancer was estrogen receptor negative, and the sampled lymph nodes were negative. The tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive. She opted not to take tamoxifen or other antiestrogen therapy. To prevent cancer recurrence, external beam radiation to right breast was completed (October 2008). She experienced local radiation side effects of erythema and superficial blister formation that resolved with local wound care.\\nApproximately 7 months after completing radiation therapy, she developed two painful blisters in the inframammary fold of the right breast. On examination she was found to have generalized induration of the right breast and right axilla attributed to postradiation fibrosis. The breast and axilla were warm to touch and painful to palpation. That was with sparing of the areola. Additional lesions distant from the radiation field were also noted. These included hyperpigmentation of the skin at the waistline, induration of the skin in the left upper inner thigh and left groin, and a shiny patch of thickened skin on the anterior left shin. The lesions not involving the breast and axilla were not painful.\\nIn May 2009, a punch biopsy of the left groin lesion diagnosed localized scleroderma (morphea). On microscopy, the skin surface was thin with a slightly keratotic epidermis. The papillary dermis was edematous and homogenous. The reticular dermis had dense collagen in bundles with intervening mild lymphoid and plasma cellular inflammation present around the adnexal structures. Mild chronic inflammation in the subcutaneous fat was noted at the base of the biopsy. For treatment of the right breast and axillary lesions, topical calcipotriol and topical betamethasone dipropionate were prescribed without benefit. Painful ulcers developed in the area of application in the right axilla which healed slowly when the topical medications were discontinued. The area under the right breast remained painful with chronic superficial ulceration. Application of topical silver impregnated dressings was of no benefit.\\nIn addition to the skin lesions, she described fatigue and generalized arthralgias. She denied more specific symptoms of systemic connective tissue disease, that is, no history of Raynaud's, esophageal reflux, shortness of breath, cough, joint swelling, morning stiffness, sicca symptoms, pleuritis, or serositis. Prior to diagnosis of breast cancer, she had no significant past medical or psychiatric history and was on no prescribed medications. Family history was negative for connective tissue disease. Physical examination confirmed circumferential induration of the right breast with sparing of the areola. Induration extended into the right axilla. Superficial erosion of the epidermis was noted in the inframammary fold of the right breast. A band of hyperpigmented, thickened skin was noted along the anterior waistline. A hypopigmented indurated patch was noted in the left groin with a healed punch biopsy site. Thinning of the skin with hypopigmentation and superficial telangiectasias was noted in the upper left medial thigh. A 3 cm patch with central hypopigmentation was present on the left anterior mid tibia. She had no sclerodactyly. Nail fold examination for capillary changes was normal. Examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. Laboratory testing was normal, including complete blood count, chemistry panel, thyroid function tests, and urine analysis. Sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal. Lyme titer was negative. Thyroid autoantibody testing was negative. ANA was interpreted as borderline positive, with titer of 1 : 160 in a speckled pattern. Further testing for ANA subtypes was negative for anti-topoisomerase, anti-RNP, anti-Smith, anti-ds DNA, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB.\\nShe was prescribed minocycline 100 mg twice a day, and, after three days of therapy, she reported dramatic improvement in generalized pain and fatigue. The superficial erosions in the inframammary fold healed. However, despite the initial perceived benefit, the right breast remained warm and tender to palpation. New lesions occurred on the right lower extremity. In August 2010, methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly and titrated to 12.5 mg was prescribed. Folic acid 1 mg per day was prescribed to prevent methotrexate side effects. After the addition of methotrexate, no new lesions occurred. Signs of inflammation in the irradiated right breast resolved though skin thickening remained unchanged. The lesions on bilateral lower extremities softened. Minocycline was discontinued in March 2011 when abnormal pigmentation developed as a side effect. She remained without signs or symptoms of a systemic connective tissue disease.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 24-year-old man was referred to the Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology for evaluation of an asymptomatic bony hard expansion in relation to the buccal aspect of maxillary right canine & first premolar. Patient's medical history was non-contributory. The lesion was slow growing with one-year duration. It had increased in size slowly for nine months and remained static thereafter. Clinical examination did not show any endodontic or coronal pathologic condition of the neighboring maxillary canine, first premolar, and the maxillary incisors. \\nPanoramic (Fig. 1) and occlusal radiographs (Fig. 2) showed an oval well-defined unilocular expansile radiolucency measuring 2 x 1.7 cm. The lesion had a target-like appearance with a central area of floccular calcification and caused divergence of the roots of the right canine and maxillary first premolar with no root resorption. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings a provisional differential diagnosis was reached. Central ossifying fibroma, focal cemento-ossifying dysplasia and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor were the pathologies considered.\\nSince the lesion was small and appeared well demarcated on radiographs patient was advised to undergo an excisional biopsy. Upon patient's acceptance and medical clearance, the procedure was performed. The lesion was easily separated from the surrounding tissue and enucleated in toto. Gross examination showed an encapsulated lesion with a thick wall, to which multiple irregular gritty pieces of tissue were attached. The overall size of the excised lesion was 3.4x 3x 1.3 cm. The cut- section of the encapsulated lesion showed an intracapsular solid mass with multiple cystic spaces. The overall consistency of the contents was gritty. The entire tissue was prepared for microscopic examination. The tissue blocks were processed for routine paraffin embedding without decalcification. \\nA whole slide digital scan showed the presence of two distinct and yet closely associated contiguous lesions. A larger well-encapsulated lesion with a thick fibrous wall containing multinodular cellular proliferation with scanty connective tissue and multiple empty areas and, small fibrocellular proliferations interspersed with irregular mineralization partly attached to the extra-capsular surface (Fig. 3A & B).\\nThe cellular mass within the encapsulated lesion consisted of multiple nodules of varying sizes. The majority of the nodules consisted of cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells that formed nests, rosette-like patterns and duct- like spaces. Tumor droplets (eosinophilic amorphous material) were seen between the cells and in the rosette- like structures. The spaces between the nodules were occupied by interlacing strands of oval, angular and elongated epithelial cells. Basaloid epithelial cells formed single and double layered trabecular or cribriform configurations between and connecting cell rich nodules (Fig. 4A & B). Few areas showed collections of eosinophilic polyhedral squamous like epithelial cells with well-defined cell borders (Fig. 5A) and intercellular bridges (Fig. 5B). Calcified bodies were found through- out the lesion but were mostly associated with the polygonal cells (Fig. 5B). The mineralization was in the form of globular mineralization that was nearly translucent and, concentric rings (Liesegang pattern). Islands of amyloid- like material that were Congo-red positive and produced characteristic apple green birefringence on polarized microscopy were also found (Fig. 6A-C). The stromal connective tissue was overall scant and loose. The endothelial lining of the blood vessels showed degenerative changes (Fig. 4A).\\nThe extra capsular lesion consisted of multiple small fragments of fibrocellular mesenchymal tissue interspersed with numerous irregular and interconnecting bone and cementum- like material. An artefactual split existed between parts of the lesion and the fibrous capsule. The fibrocellular collections showed few hemorrhagic areas, thick curvilinear ginger root-like trabeculae with few lacunae and ovoid cementicles with prominent resting lines. Cellular areas showed spindle-shaped fibroblasts. (Fig. 7A & B). The maturing areas of the lesion showed a confluence of woven and lamellar bone (Fig. 8A & B).\\nThe resultant diagnosis was two- fold and reported the existence of two concomitant and contiguous lesions. First lesion was diagnosed as extra-follicular AOT with CEOT-like areas based on clinicopathological findings. The second lesion was diagnosed as an FCOD attached to the fibrous wall of the AOT in an extra capsular relation based on the radiological and histological findings that were confirmed by gross findings of the surgical specimen. \\nFollow-up was uneventful and showed normal bone healing and the canine and first premolar, were vital two years postoperative.\",\n",

Considering that the patient is only 36 years old, her strong desire to remove the tumor as well as retain the kidney, and the relatively indolent nature of the RCC, retroperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed by an experienced surgeon after the risk was explained and informed consent was signed.\\nDuring the procedure, the patient was placed in the lateral flank position and underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The procedure was performed through a retroperitoneal approach, and the retroperitoneal cavity was formed by blunt dissection and balloon dilation from a small incision located 2 cm above the iliac crest of the midaxillary line. After the establishment of the retroperitoneal space, four trocars were inserted on the left waist between the superior edge of the iliac spine and the inferior border of the rib. The tumor was removed completely, and renal reconstruction was then achieved with a 1/0 self-retaining barbed suture (V-Loc). Although maternal hemodynamic parameters were maintained stable and end-tidal CO2 was monitored below 35 mmHg, pneumoperitoneum pressure was strictly controlled below 12 mmHg to reduce maternal hypercapnia and fetal acidosis throughout the surgery. The operation time was 100 min with a warm ischemia time of 28 min and an estimated blood loss of 150 ml. The patient recovered uneventfully after the operation and was discharged within a week after the surgery. Blood hemoglobin was decreased postoperatively [95 g/L on postoperative day (POD) 1, 99 g/L on POD3] and back to normal on POD7 (121 g/L), while serum creatinine levels were normal throughout the perioperative period (66 mumol/L on POD1, 61 mumol/L on POD3, and 60 mumol/L on POD7). Obstetrics and gynecology consultation monitored the fetus before and throughout the operation.\\nThe pathology report revealed an 8.2-cm clear RCC, Fuhrman grade 2, with negative surgical margins (Figure 2). According to the TNM classification system, it is classified as pT2aN0M0. During the 38th gestational week, a healthy male infant was born. We followed our patient every half year after surgery.

       "    'case_text': 'This diminutive structure has been investigated for its potential role in seizure generalization (Fernandez-Miranda et al.,). It is thought that epileptoform propagation from limbic sites may be linked to the motor cortex via the claustrum (Mohapel et al.,). A case study was conducted on a 12-year-old girl who presented with status epilepticus (multiple, repeated complex partial and myoclonic seizures occurred in the upper extremities and face with orofacial automatisms, eye deviation, and nystagmus) displaying psychotic behavior with agitation, severe cognitive impairment and temporary loss of vision, hearing and speech, as well as loss of orientation in time and place. Bilateral, strip-like lesions were discovered in T1 and T2 images of her claustrum and external capsule. The case indicates that lesions of the claustrum function more like gray matter disease than white matter disease. Additionally, the case study implies a functional correlation between seizures, behavioral state, and abnormalities in the claustrum (Sperner et al.,).\\nIn contrast, unilateral removal of the claustrum did not lead to sensorimotor or cognitive impairment in patients receiving surgery for low-grade cerebral glioma (Duffau et al.,). So, perhaps the claustrum operates as part of a network or networks, rather than as the epicenter of a network.\\nThe most common clinical association is the effect of the claustrum on memory. Claustral amyloid plaques accumulation has been implicated in the outcomes of Alzheimer\\'s disease and aging (Morys et al.,; Fernandez-Miranda et al.,). These amyloid deposits seem to cluster in the ventral claustrum, and may disrupt limbic connections (Morys et al.,). These changes in the claustrum associated with aging, however, are subtle, appearing several years after those in the cerebral cortex become apparent. The claustrum has also been examined in cases of memory impairment associated with HIV, AIDS, Parkinson\\'s, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) (Kozlowski et al.,; Yamamoto et al.,; Smith et al.,; Kalaitzakis et al.,).\\nOther neurological conditions have been examined in the claustrum as well. Negative correlations between anhedonia and metabolism in the claustrum have been shown in both patients with unipolar depression and bipolar disorder (BD), which may be part of overall enlargement of the basal ganglia and increase in claustral GM volume in BD (Chen et al.,). Such factors may be the result of differences in pruning between diseased and healthy populations. Severity of delusions in schizophrenia is correlated with the reduction in left claustral volume (Cascella et al.,) and schizophrenia patients with hallucinations show signs of white matter excesses (Shapleske et al.,). The claustrum is alternately reported as spared from insular gliomas, or commonly found to be invaded by such tumors (Fernandez-Miranda et al.,).\\nIn Wilson\\'s disease, abnormal brightness of T2-weighted images in the claustrum is considered one of the markers of the disease though its effects may be misattributed in the literature to its close neighbor, the putamen (Sener,; King et al.,). In fact, Wilson himself cited the possible role of the claustrum in his initial description of the disease in 1912 (though he referred to it as \"Progressive Lenticular Degeneration\") (Wilson,; Sener,). The disease, which is invariably fatal without intervention, is caused by high copper levels:and sometimes iron levels:in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia. Symptoms include bilateral tremors of the extremities, spasticity of the limbs and face, emaciation, dysphagia, dysarthria, emotionalism, and difficulty maintaining equilibrium (Wilson,).\\nBased on the summation of the micro-connectomics information gathered from centuries of histology, structural imaging, functional imaging, and clinical pathology studies, interactions have been proposed between the claustrum and every major sensory network. The extent to which these networks rely on the function of the claustrum, or to which the claustrum relies on information from these networks, remains to be investigated.\\nClaustral neurons are overwhelmingly binocular; 84% respond to stimuli from either eye, while only 40% of overall cortical neurons do (Sherk and LeVay,). Responses in the claustrum to photic stimuli can be abolished by lesioning the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (Edelstein and Denaro,). V1 connections may not be reciprocal, as connections from V1 to the claustrum in macaques have not been reported (Crick and Koch,).\\nCortico-claustral connections from layer VI reach layer IV through the claustrum, creating an alternative route to the direct projection from layer VI to layer IV (LeVay and Sherk,). In the contralateral half of the visual field, the upper fields map to the caudal region of the claustrum, while the lower ones map rostrally. The far periphery can be mapped to the claustral surface, while the vertical meridian lies at the lower limit of the visual region. A single representation of the visual hemi-field exists as a unified map without discontinuities or duplications in the claustrum (LeVay and Sherk,).\\nThe medial ectosylvian gyrus (AII) relays information from the medial geniculate nucleus to the claustrum. In fact, ablation of the entire AII results in a lack of claustral response to MGN stimulation (Edelstein and Denaro,).\\nFunctional localization has not been demonstrated in the claustrum, so it is unlikely that the claustrum can influence specific muscular groups (Salerno et al.,).\\nThe claustral loop to the striate cortex is involved in motion detection, but cannot discriminate the direction of motion (Edelstein and Denaro,). Most (approximately 70%) of movement-related neurons increased discharge regardless of whether the motion was a push, a pull, or a turn, while only 16% were selective to one movement. This differs from the specificity of the motor cortex itself, in which about half of the neurons are responsive to a single motion (Shima et al.,). This may be indicative of a high degree of convergence of inputs. This lack of selectivity, along with the presence of inhibitory efferents, may suggest that the claustrum generally suppresses cortical activity immediately before the initiation of movement.\\nProjections to M1, pre-SMA, SMA-proper, and various subdivisions of PM and area 46 emanate from the entire rostro-caudal extent of the claustrum, with no distinct topographic or somatotopic organization. Along the dorso-ventral axis, however, these projections tend to originate in the dorsal or intermediate claustrum (Tanne-Gariepy et al.,). There is overlap of region of origin in most motor areas, but Pre-SMA and SMA-proper both uniquely show local segregation through inter-digitations. Area 46 also receives projections from the most ventral portion of the caudal claustrum, which sends minor projections to M1, the subareas of PM, pre-SMA, and SMA-proper (Tanne-Gariepy et al.,). M1 projections to the claustrum are then projected to S1, indicating a role in sensorimotor coordination (Smith et al.,).\\nIn terms of oculomotor control, the mid-ventral claustrum receives projections from the frontal eye fields, and is organized topographically according to the size of saccades (Tanne-Gariepy et al.,).\\nWhile there is general agreement on its heterotopic organization, there is no apparent somatotopic organization of the claustrum (Spector et al.,). Some somatic afferents to the claustrum are conveyed via the posterior spinal funiculi fibers. In addition, the anterior ectosylvian gyrus (SII) relays information from the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) to the claustrum. Lesions in the VPL lead to reduced responsivity of the claustrum to skin stimulation. Marked claustral activity was noted in response to stimuli in somatic-vagal-tooth pulp. This may be indicative of trigeminal projections similar to those noted in other structures of the basal ganglia (Edelstein and Denaro,).',\n",

Preoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed a persistently enhanced mass in the pancreas tail that measured 20 x 25 mm (Fig. 1a,b), significantly enlarged #11p (18 x 22 mm) (Fig. 1a) and #18 (10 x 12 mm) lymph nodes (Fig. 2a), and an equivocal #11d node (8 x 10 mm) (Fig. 1a). Whole-body SRS with SPECT/CT scanning demonstrated abnormal uptake in the primary tail tumor (Fig. 1c), as well as the #11p (Fig. 1c) and #18 (Fig. 2b) nodes, while the #11d node showed no uptake in SRS findings (Fig. 1c). Whole-body FDG-PET/CT scanning showed mild FDG uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.89 in the primary tail tumor (Fig. 1d) and mild FDG uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.42 in the #11p node (Fig. 1d), with the #11d (Fig. 1d) and #18 (Fig. 2c) nodes showing no FDG uptake. No distant metastatic lesion was indicated by SRS with SPECT/CT or FDG-PET/CT findings, and the clinical stage was determined to be T2N1M0.\\nPhysicians at the Department of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery performed a laparoscopic resection of the pancreatic body and tail (Fig. 3a), plus dissection of abdominal lymph nodes, which included #8 (common hepatic artery nodes), #10 (splenic hilum nodes), #11 (splenic artery nodes), and #18 (inferior pancreatic nodes). A pathologic examination of the tail tumor, sized 20 x 23 mm, revealed a PNET with tumor cells small to intermediate in size, which had formed sheets and nests (G2) (Fig. 3b). Immunohistochemical findings with chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and somatostatin were positive, and the Ki-67 index was 5% (Fig. 3c-e). Pathological analyses of the lymph nodes showed that none of three in #8, none of four in #10, one (13 x 19 mm) of four in #11p, one (7 x 9 mm) of two in #11d, and one (8 x 12 mm) of three in #18 were metastatic. SSTR results of the primary tumor (Fig. 3f) showed positive staining, indicating three metastatic nodes: all of #11p, part (6 x 6 mm) of #11d, and all of #18 (Fig. 4a-c).',\n",

Her upper limbs were also affected by age. The myotonia could be alleviated by continued activity (warm-up phenomenon). Her clinical manifestations also include transient weakness upon initiating movements but were not associated with handgrip or lid myotonia. The myotonia symptoms did not severely impact the quality of her life. In addition, VI: 3 showed recurrent flaccid paralysis mainly involving bilateral lower limbs in 11-year-old children. The attacks always lasted for a few hours or for a day, which usually occurred after cold exposure and vigorous exercise. Periodic paralysis was not associated with dyspnea or dysarthria. Her father (V: 7) was definitively diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis in his twenties. Her mother (V: 6) suffered from myotonia and muscle hypertrophy from childhood. Physical examination revealed normal muscle force without muscle hypertrophy or myodystrophy. The percussion myotonia was negative. The laboratory tests showed no abnormalities in creatine kinase levels. Her previous examinations in another hospital suggested that the serum levels of potassium were below the normal range during paralysis attacks. Electromyography (EMG) examination revealed myotonic potential in her four limbs. Her recurrent flaccid paralysis could be relieved by oral potassium supplementation treatment. Comprehensive analysis of the clinical symptoms, family history, positive physical laboratory findings and therapeutic effects suggested a clinical diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis in combination with MC. She did not require carbamazepine treatment to alleviate her myotonia symptoms.\\nIn the family, IV: 2, V: 2 (the proband) and V: 6 showed varying degrees of muscle stiffness and hypertrophy. Their EMG examination revealed myotonic potential. They were clinically diagnosed with MC in our hospital. IV: 1, who died a natural death, and V: 3, who died in a car accident, also had muscle stiffness and hypertrophy. We speculated that they were also affected by MC.

He came to our hospital in April 2016 for the first time. EMG only identified myotonic potential. In 2019, the proband underwent EMG examination again, which showed not only myotonic potential but also slight muscle damage. Clinical findings are presented in Table 1.\\nThe WES yielded data covering 99.73% of the target region. Three mutations were identified during the first three steps of the filtering strategies (Table 2). Then, the pathogenicity of the mutations was predicted by MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2 and SIFT. Considering the bioinformatics analysis results and ACMG guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants, we chose the F306S CLCN1 mutation and the R222W SCN4A mutation as the potential pathogenic variants.\\nSanger sequencing validated the two candidate variants in the pedigree (Fig 1B). VI: 3 carried both the heterozygous c.917T>C, p.F306S, g.14710T>C CLCN1 mutation and the heterozygous c.664C>T, p.R222W, g.1718C>T SCN4A mutation. Nothing abnormal was detected in the length of DMPK gene CTG and ZNF9 gene CCTG repeats in V: 2.\\nRepresentative current traces from HEK293T cells expressing WT, CLC-1_F306L and CLC-1_F306S are shown in Fig 2A-2C. The current values (pA) determined by the cell capacitance (pF) were used to calculate the instantaneous and steady-state current densities (pA/pF) and thereby establish I-V associations. The I-V curves of instantaneous currents for CLC-1 channels are presented in Fig 2D. At negative test voltages (ranging from -180 to 0 mV), the WT channel displayed large outward currents, while the two mutant channels (CLC-1_F306L and CLC-1_F306S) only produced a small inward rectification. In contrast, at positive test voltages (0-200 mV), the two mutant channels conducted outward currents, while the WT channel conducted inward currents. The average instantaneous current densities of mutant CLC-1_F306L and mutant CLC-1_F306S at -180 mV were 13.0+-1.5 pA/pF (n = 12) and 18.6+-1.6 pA/pF (n = 11), respectively. These current densities were significantly different from that of the WT channel (-288.4+-36.8 pA/pF, n = 9, P<0.001). At the resting potential of normal skeletal muscle fibers (~-85 mV), chloride ions were conducted outward (Cl- efflux) through the WT CLC-1 channel, whereas the mutant channels facilitated a small Cl- influx. Therefore, the p.F306S and p.F306L mutations in the CLCN1 gene disrupted the chloride ion balance across the cell membrane.\\nThe I-V curves of steady-state currents revealed that the reversal potentials of the mutant channels CLC-1_F306L and CLC-1_F306S were +50 and +160 mV, respectively and were markedly shifted in the depolarizing direction compared with the 0-mV reversal potential of the WT channel (Fig 2E).\\nThe voltage-dependent activation curves of the WT and mutant channels, calculated from tail currents at -105 mV, are presented in Fig 2F. The V1/2 of the mutant channels were markedly more depolarized relative to the WT channel (F306L: 91.1+-2.1 mV, n = 12; F306S: 127.0+-5.9 mV, n = 11; WT: -49.2+-1.8 mV, n = 9, P<0.001), with a significant alteration in the slope factors (WT: 17.4+-1.6 mV, n = 9; CLC-1_F306L: 33.6+-1.7 mV, n = 12; CLC-1_ F306S: 49.2+-3.3 mV, n = 11, P<0.001). These results suggested that, compared with the WT CLC-1 channel, the voltage-dependent activation of two mutations at position 306 in the CLC-1 channel markedly shifted toward a positive potential.',\n",

The illustration visualized the relationship of how the older generations and one's own generation were benefiting the current generation and future generations via disposable plastics. Owing to the wide range of participant age groups, the illustrations of the participants' own generation and previous generations were changed according to age group (under 50 years or 50 years and older). Because those over 50 years old were less likely to have living parents, we presented older people in the traditional clothing that their parents and grandparents wore. This illustrative framework was based on our previous survey of nudges for increasing positive attitudes toward air pollution caused by industrialization (S2 Appendix in S1 File).\\nThe respondents were again asked the same question as for Qpre before the intervention (Qpost). Both of the questions ascertained the perceived risks of disposable plastics on Future Generations and Yourself before and after receiving the designed messages.\\nThe statistical analyses comprised three parts. The first part was analysis based on descriptive statistics for the initial status of respondents, such as the attitudes toward plastic recycling and COVID-19. The second part was a difference-in-difference (DID) estimation to identify the intervention effects by comparing a control group with treatment groups on how the attitude change differed across the groups. Then, correlation analyses were performed to investigate how perceived support by older generations via recycling disposable plastics and perceived support of future generations that benefit from the recycling were correlated with the message effects. Estimation of the message effects based on descriptive statistics was also conducted by segment, such as sex and age. The third part was a panel analysis based on forced-entry linear regression models to extract the intervention effects more precisely by separating the influence of the respondents' basic attributes and personality traits.\\nTo identify our designed message effects in all the analyses, we set two separate explained variables, which were perceived risks of disposable plastics to future generations (Future Generations) and those to the respondents themselves (Yourself). Although we evaluated both of the explained variables in parallel, our main target variable was Future Generations to determine the effectiveness of the nudging message.\\nStatistical significance of the differences across our segments was calculated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All error bars in graphs were computed as 95% confidence intervals based on t-distributions.

One year before presentation the saline implants were leaked and replaced with gel implants. She developed a recurrent fluid collection involving her right breast (Figure 1). A drain was placed and yielded minimal output before being removed 1 week later. Cytology of the fluid demonstrated atypical appearing lymphocytes. The fluid later reaccumulated, and right axillary lymphadenopathy was noted on physical exam (largest node 5.1 cm on ultrasound). Core needle biopsy of the node revealed rare atypical cells.\\nShe underwent capsulectomy and right axillary nodal excisional biopsy with bilateral implant removal in 2011. On histopathologic analysis, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative was demonstrated in the fibrous capsule, cystic fluid, and axillary lymph nodes (Figures 2 and 3). Imaging with CT and PET scans demonstrated residual right axillary lymphadenopathy with FDG avidity, as illustrated in Figure 4. Bone marrow analysis was performed and showed no evidence of lymphoma involvement. The patient was staged as Ann Arbor stage IIE. She was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, vincristine 2 mg, and prednisone. Prednisone required a dose reduction from 100 to 75 mg after the first cycle to minimize hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes mellitus type II. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg was injected each cycle for hematopoietic support. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID was used daily for bacterial infection prophylaxis. After cycle 2, she began to display adverse effects of nausea grade 2, oral mucositis grade 1, and dysgeusia grade 2 per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading scale version 4.03. Tetrahydrocannabinol was administered for treatment of nausea and anorexia. Weight loss of grade 1 occurred by the end of therapy. Interval PET and CT imaging were performed after cycle 2, demonstrating metabolic activity of SUV 0.88 in the right axillary lymph nodes, a partial response. Repeat PET imaging was performed after cycle 4 of chemotherapy, confirming complete response to treatment.\\nAdjuvant radiation therapy was then delivered to the right breast, axilla, and right supraclavicular nodes to 30.6 Gy in 1.80 Gy fractions, finishing in January of 2012. A monoisocentric technique was used with breast tangents matched to a field covering the supraclavicular nodes and high axilla. The axilla levels 1-3 were contoured and a lightly weighted posterior axillary field was used to bring the volume up to the prescription dose (Figure 5). With therapy, the patient experienced grade 1 dermatitis manifested as faint erythema within the treatment field. Two-year follow-up with PET imaging and clinical evaluation showed no evidence of disease. The patient wished to have breast augmentation again. She underwent silicone gel implant placement bilaterally and has been followed for an additional year without evidence of disease.\\nPrimary breast lymphomas represent about 0.1-0.5% of total breast tumors, and approximately 3% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas of extranodal sites. Tumors of ALCL histology represent 2% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas and are the second most common peripheral T cell lymphoma. The entity of breast implant-associated ALCL was first described by Keech and Creech in 1997, and currently at least 60 cases have been described in the literature. A study in the Netherlands estimated that the incidence of breast implant-associated ALCL is 1 out of 500,000 per woman with prostheses per year, using a case-control model with breast lymphomas other than ALCL as the control. However, there has been controversy regarding the level of risk associated with breast prosthesis implantation. The FDA reports that 5-10 million women have undergone breast implantation, leading to a possible estimation of breast-associated ALCL incidence of 1:80,000 to 1:170,000 given the 60 reported cases thus far.\\nMorphologically, ALCL is composed of large blastic cells with pleomorphic, often horseshoe-shaped or multiple nuclei. Growth is in a cohesive pattern often involving lymph node sinuses with a variable composition of granulocytes and macrophages. In breast-associated and cutaneous ALCL, the cells are CD30 positive on cytogenetic studies and negative for ALK. In contrast, systemic ALCL is characterized by positive ALK. Those who present with a mass rather than an effusion have a higher risk of failure or relapse. Various treatment regimens have been employed including surgery (implant removal) followed by observation, chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy and radiation, and radiation alone. Patients who present with disease limited to an effusion surrounding the fibrous capsule surrounding the implant have been shown to have a favorable outcome with observation; however, there are rare cases of advanced and treatment-resistant disease leading to fatality. The ideal treatment schema is yet to be elucidated.\\nWe report a locally advanced case of breast implant-associated ALCL at our institution. Pathologic axillary nodal involvement by breast implant-associated ALCL is rare: only four cases of pathologically confirmed disease of the axillary nodes have been described. Of the 60 cases reported, workup for axillary nodal involvement was carried out in 29, 10 of which were found to have clinical evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy. Four of these were confirmed pathologically; our patient represents the fifth.',\n",

Her medical history showed an appendectomy, hypertension, and a trigeminal neuralgia due to repetitive sinus infections. Current medication was amitriptyline, gabapentin, diclofenac, omeprazole, metoprolol, and acetaminophen combined with codeine. \\nInduction of anaesthesia was carried out with fentanyl and propofol. To facilitate tracheal intubation 100 mg succinylcholine (0.9 mg/kg) had been administered unintentionally. Maintenance was performed with intermittent dosages of fentanyl, morphine and a continuous infusion of propofol. The surgical procedure lasted 90 minutes and was done uneventfully.\\nMonitoring of neuromuscular function was started using acceleromyography (TOF-Watch SX), by performing intermittently a \"train-of-four\". Determination of the supramaximal stimulus could not be performed, as deep neuromuscular blockade was already induced. Anaesthesia, using propofol continuously in combination with intermittent doses of morphine, and neuromuscular monitoring were continued until recovery of the TOF-ratio above 90%; at this value it was assumed that the patient could breathe without help. Recovery of neuromuscular function took more than seven hours. The first twitch was seen 87 minutes after the administration of succinylcholine. The course was uneventful although the patient was emotional and anxious postoperatively we were able to regain her trust after several talks.\\nAfter informing this adverse event to the patient and her partner, she gave permission to take blood samples for quantitative and qualitative analysis and for molecular genetic investigation.\\nThe plasma concentration of cholinesterase was 2520 U/l (ref: 4800-12000 U/l) and the dibucaine number was 8. These results are indicative for a homozygous atypical variant. Because of the very long clinical duration of action we did not limit molecular genetic investigations to known BCHE variants but decided to sequence both strands of the complete BCHE coding sequence.

We performed panretinal photocoagulation in both eyes using a multicolor photocoagulation laser system (Novus Varia , Lumenis Ltd, Yokneam, Israel). Since the yellow light laser (wavelength 561 nm) was invalid for the hypopigmented areas of the fundus, we chose to use the green light laser (wavelength 532 nm) in order to perform panretinal photocoagulation over the entire extramacular area. Due to the diabetic retinopathy, tractional foveal detachment in her right eye and mild vitreous hemorrhage of her left eye occurred at 10 months after panretinal photocoagulation. Because of this, we then carried out pars plana vitrectomy in both eyes. At approximately 2 years after her surgery, her condition normalized, and at the present time, her best corrected visual acuity remains at 20/30 and 20/20 in her right left eyes, respectively.\",\n",

During intraoral examination, a 1 x 1 mm translucent nodule with a smooth round surface was noted. It was located in the attached gingiva between the lower left mandibular canine and first incisor. The nodule was asymptomatic, cystic in appearance, fluctuant, and noncompressible (Figure 1). Pulp testing of his lower left canine and central incisor indicated normal pulp vitality. Radiographically, there was no finding suggestive of osseous involvement. The patient was unaware of the lesion prior to this assessment. Complementing his oral assessment, he also had bilateral agenesis of his lower lateral incisors and first premolars (Figure 2). Based on the clinical and radiographic findings, the provisional diagnoses were salivary gland tumor or cystic lesion of the gingiva.\\nDue to the size of the lesion, an excisional biopsy was performed under local anesthetic infiltration. An incision was made in the overlying mucosa and the lesion was completely dissected from the adjacent tissues. The specimen was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and sent to the Oral Pathology Laboratory of the Sao Leopoldo Mandic Dental Institute and Research Center for histopathologic examination. On macroscopic inspection, the material consisted of a nodular fragment of soft tissue, measuring 5 x 3 x 2 mm, with smooth surface, whitish coloration, and friable consistency. Histological sections revealed a cystic cavity lined by two or three layers of odontogenic epithelium (Figure 3), exhibiting focal epithelial plates containing clear cells (Figure 4). The histopathologic diagnosis was of a gingival cyst of the adult.\\nThe sutures were removed 1 week postoperatively and the patient reported minimal discomfort. After one month, the patient returned for follow-up when complete resolution of the lesion was observed. The patient is currently under regular follow-up with satisfactory healing and no relapse for over 15 months.

Her disease manifested with excessive bleeding including menorrhagia and epistaxis. Laboratory evaluation confirmed type 1 VWD with ristocetin cofactor activity of 38%, von Willebrand antigen level of 41%, factor VIII level of 60%, and a normal von Willebrand factor multimer distribution. The patient had type A blood and abnormal Platelet Function Assay (PFA) markedly prolonged clotting times with both collagen/epinephrine and collagen/ADP stimulation. The patient previously underwent a DDAVP challenge test which more than doubled her ristocetin activity after administration of 20 mcg of intravenous DDAVP. This challenge test was not followed by any complications. She presented to the pain clinic with a long-standing history of low back and bilateral lower extremity pain. Over the years, she had tried a variety of medications, multiple episodes of physical therapy, and other conservative care without significant improvement. MRI imaging of the lumbar spine revealed an annular tear and disc bulge at L5-S1. After discussion of risks versus benefits of the procedure and the need for consideration of DDAVP to reduce the risk of bleeding, the patient underwent an infusion of DDAVP 0.3 mcg/kg receiving a total of 22 mcg over a period of 30 minutes immediately before the procedure. The patient was not given any specific instructions for fluid restriction postoperatively. Bilateral L5-S1 transforaminal epidural steroid injections were carried out. Once needle position and good contrast spread along the nerve roots were confirmed, an injection of 1 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and 40 mg methylprednisolone was carried out on each side. Although the procedure was performed without incident, the patient experienced persistent dizziness and a nonpositional headache early the next day. Thorough investigation, including serial serum and urine electrolyte evaluations, revealed findings consistent with hyponatremia (serum sodium: 125 mmol/L), which was a decrease from baseline serum sodium of 138 mmol/L. Further investigation also revealed excessive water intake of 80 ounces per day that may have contributed to the acute onset of hyponatremia. The electrolyte disorder was gradually corrected over a period of 24 hours through fluid restriction and administration of sodium with complete resolution of symptoms. Serum sodium went from 125 mmol/L to 128 mmol/L at the 6th hour after diagnosis, to 134 mmol/L at the 10th hour, and then to 139 mmol/L at the 18th hour after diagnosis and remained at 136-139 mmol/L for the next several days to weeks on outpatient follow-up.',\n",

Treatment plans for the patient included three courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], and predisone) chemotherapy plus rituximab (chimeric CD 20 monoclonal antibody), to be followed by involved field radiation. After the first cycle of chemotherapy in July 2001, neutropenia developed in the patient after both the second and third cycles of chemochemotherapy. The third cycle of chemotherapy was administered on September 11, 2001. Four days later, she was treated with oral levofloxacin for low-grade fever. On day 7 after chemotherapy, she was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, chills, rhinorrhea, joint aches, decreased appetite, lethargy, and lightheadedness. She had no recollection of any ill contacts or insect bites. She was a resident of southern Nassau County, New York, and did not have a history of travel. Physical examination was within normal limits. The patient was neutropenic; G-CSF was continued, and she was given cefipime and gentamicin. One day after admission, she continued to have fever and experienced mild headaches that responded to acetaminophen. Urine cultures showed penicillin-sensitive enterococci, and blood cultures were negative. Two days after admission, the patient continued to have fever, headaches, and dizziness. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed no acute cerebral processes. On the 3rd day after admission, the patient was noted to be confused. Further deterioration of mental status was noted, with incomprehensible speech, but she was able to follow commands. Arterial blood-gas analysis showed an acute respiratory acidosis pattern, and the patient was subsequently intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient had a hypotensive episode secondary to atrial flutter, which required cardioversion for stabilization. Ceftriaxone and ampicillin were added to the antibiotic coverage, and antifungal treatment was also initiated with lipid complex amphotericin B. After the patient's hematologic parameters improved, G-CSF was discontinued on day 9 of hospitalization, and the patient continued to be afebrile. Because of the clinical picture of encephalitis and because the patient lived in an area where WNV was endemic, lumbar puncture was performed on day 8, and a CSF specimen was sent to the New York State Department of Health laboratories for comprehensive PCR testing. Renal tubular necrosis developed in the patient, leading to acute renal failure by day 10, with further deterioration of her mental status. Dialysis was initiated on day 16, and antibiotic therapy was discontinued on day 17 as the patient remained afebrile and the neutropenia was resolved. The patient remained unresponsive, staphylococcal septicemia developed, and she died on day 35 of hospitalization.

He immediately underwent chemotherapy (two DAV cycles and 4 ProMECE-CytaBOM cycles) and, one year later, bone marrow transplant (BMT). One month after BMT he developed a GVHD with skin and articular involvement. When he was 41 years old he developed muscular symptoms (myalgias and hyperCKemia). He underwent a skeletal muscle biopsy which led to a diagnosis of polymyositis: he was treated with steroids for some months and with azathioprine for three years with complete disease remission. \\nAt age of 42-years myeloma relapsed: the patient was treated with thalidomide for six years with good clinical remission, but progressively increasing levels of serum IgD were demonstrated.\\n Six years later (at age of 48 years), the patient came to our observation for a new onset of neuromuscular symptoms: distal lower limb hypopallaesthesia, proximal limb hypotrophy, lower limb girdle weakness, hyperCKemia. Conduction studies examination showed changes suggestive of axonal polyneuropathy associated with a myopathic pattern on needle EMG investigation. \\n He underwent both muscle and peripheral nerve biopsy to discriminate between myositis (paraproteinemia versus GVHD), amyloidosis, and thalidomide toxicity. Conventional histological/histochemical studies along with immunohistochemistry for HLA, membrane attack complex (MAC), and IgD, were performed on both skeletal muscle biopsies and peripheral nerve cryostat sections. CD8, CD4, CD19, and CD68 immunohistochemistry was performed on skeletal muscle only. The first muscle biopsy showed an inflammatory pattern with necrotic fibres, macrophage invasion (CD68 positivity), rare interstitial cellular infiltrates, rare CD8 and absence of CD4 lymphocytes, widespread sarcolemmal HLA positivity, and no MAC detection in capillaries. The second muscle biopsy showed the same inflammatory pattern seen in the previous one plus an involvement of blood vessels (several perivascular cellular infiltrates in muscle with mild MAC positivity) and a slight increase of endomysial connective tissue. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated both demyelinating and axonal aspects. No inflammatory infiltrates, but positive immunohistochemistry for HLA and MAC and dilated endoneurial capillaries were observed. \\n Congo Red was negative in both skeletal muscle and peripheral nerve.\\nDirect immunofluorescence for IgD was positive in both muscle biopsies: in the first one, IgD mainly accumulated along the sarcolemma; in the second one necrotic fibres and endomorphism connective were also strongly reactive. Conversely, nerve biopsy was IgD negative (see Figure 1). \\nMM is associated with amyloidosis. In our case, no Congo Red positivity was observed in both muscle and nerve tissues. Cryoglobulins were absent in serum and autoimmune diseases were excluded by the absence of the most common antibodies. \\nMyositis during chronic GVHD presents CD8-positive interstitial infiltrates with rare macrophages. Our patient's biopsies showed a predominance of macrophages: these results do not favour GVHD diagnosis even if a systemic involvement was evident when the first myositis episode occured.\\nThalidomide causes a neuropathy without inflammatory signs. In our patient, nerve biopsy showed a mixed pattern with evidence of inflammation at immunohistochemistry. \\nKiprov and Miller demonstrated IgG deposits along basement membrane and myelin sheath in case of myositis or demyelinating neuropathy during MM.\\nGiven the presence of sarcolemmal and cytoplasmic deposits of IgD in both muscle biopsies, we hypothesize that myositis in our patient is paraproteinemia-correlated. The presence of IgD deposits correlates with high blood levels of monoclonal proteins at least in the second episode. \\nConversely, polyneuropathy could be caused by thalidomide, though inflammation cannot be excluded (HLA and MAC positivity) even if we did not observe IgD deposits. \\nThis is the first case of concurrent polyneuropathy and myositis in IgD MM. In our patient neuromuscular symptoms subsided after steroid therapy.\",\n",

Except in rare instances, an individual\\'s blood type does not change over his or her lifetime.\\nToday, most blood banks report these antigens together as the result of a single test; e.g., A+, B-, AB+, O-, etc. However, in the past, these results were reported across two tests: the ABO test to report types A, B, AB and O, and the Rh test with the possible results \"positive\" and \"negative\".

He was diagnosed with stage IVA right upper lobe lung adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1a, ECOG 0), with obstructive pneumonia and right-side malignant pleural effusion. The time course of his disease starting from diagnosis and his treatment is displayed in Figure 1. The patient's lesion was found to be EGFR wild-type and ALK-negative by standard clinical testing. Furthermore, chemotherapy was not considered due to the patient's pneumonia, which was treated by antibiotics. Instead, the patient initially underwent radiotherapy (6400 cGy/30 FX).\\nIn agreement with current guidelines, broad molecular profiling was performed to identify treatment-relevant genomic alterations, and informed consent was obtained for the use of the resulting data. For analysis, a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample biopsied from the right upper lobe was used. Areas with high tumor content were identified by H&E stain, and subsequently, a macrodissection was performed to enhance the tumor cell proportion. The ACTOnco  panel from ACT Genomics, Ltd. was used for comprehensive genetic testing. The assay performs next-generation sequencing of all coding exons of 409 cancer-related genes to detect single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, and copy number variants. Details regarding this panel have been previously published. Sequence variants with a coverage of at least 25 reads and an allele frequency of >=5% for regular variants and >=2% for actionable variants were considered. An additional NGS test able to detect the presence of 72 known fusion transcripts for ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK fusion genes was also performed.\\nThere were no fusion genes detected in the patient's sample. However, 27 sequence variants, including TP53 Y220C, were identified (Table 1). The tumor had a stable copy number profile, and no copy number gains or losses were detected, with the exception of amplification of cytoband 17q12. This amplification included CDK12, PGAP3, and the clinically relevant gene ERBB2 (Figure 2). The observed copy numbers for those genes were 11.5, 15, and 15, respectively. However, the observed copy number does not take tumor purity into account, and a copy number of 45 copies for ERBB2 were calculated based on the estimated tumor purity of 30%. These results suggested an ERBB2-driven tumor and a potential benefit from therapies targeting ERBB2, such as trastuzumab.\\nThe patient started trastuzumab treatment in February 2017. Trastuzumab was first administered once as monotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy due to the patient's obstructive pneumonia. After the patient's pneumonia improved, the patient received three more doses of trastuzumab with concurrent docetaxel treatment. CT imaging in June 2017 demonstrated a necrotic regression of the right upper lobe lung lesion after the initiation of trastuzumab treatment (Figure 3). The restaging in July 2017 confirmed the absence of local recurrence. However, the patient had developed brain metastasis. There was no evidence for other systemic metastasis. Since trastuzumab and docetaxel do not effectively pass through the blood-brain barrier, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT; 3000 cGy/15FX) was initiated in addition to the continuation of trastuzumab and docetaxel. In October 2017, a follow-up was performed. At that time, the patient's ECOG performance status was 0. CT imaging of the lung showed no evidence of local progression or distant metastasis. However, the patient's blood was used for the ACTMonitor  Lung 11 gene NGS circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) test. This test covers hotspots in the genes ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, MET, PIK3CA, TP53, and U2AF1. The results showed the TP53 Y220C mutation that had previously been detected in the FFPE tumor specimen and an additional TP53 R248W mutation at allelic frequencies of 4.4% and 1.1%, respectively. The detection of tumor-specific variants in plasma upon therapy is associated with less favorable treatment outcomes, and our results indicated the possibility of a future disease progression. The patient was treated with combined bevacizumab and trastuzumab therapy, and the treatment was given three times until January 2018. At that time, CT imaging of the brain indicated a newly progressive brain metastasis. A bronchoscopic exam and serial staging studies did not indicate local tumor recurrence or other metastasis, and the obtained specimen from a bronchoscopic biopsy showed chronic inflammation but no presence of cancer cells. The patient was treated with RT for the brain metastases and atezolizumab in early February 2018. However, he developed pneumonia, followed by septic shock, and died in mid-February.\",\n",

Preoperative echocardiography demonstrated 5.8 cm dilated LA, no intracardiac thrombus and good left ventricular function (Ejection fraction 50%). Based on the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) decision, the patient has undergone convergent subxiphoid epicardial ablation on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass and AtriClip exclusion of LA appendage plus a single 200 kJ direct current (DC) cardioversion. The MDT rationale for the hybrid programme was that the LA size (5.8 cm) and endocardial ablation outcome in long-standing PersAF with this LA size were poor. The patient's informed written consent was obtained; patient confidentiality and data were protected and encrypted.\\nUnder general anaesthesia, a 2 cm midline subxiphoid incision was made, the xyphoid was preserved and raised to allow entry into the pericardium. A 5 mm pericardioscope was utilised to investigate the pericardium cavity outwardly. The coronary sinus and inferior pulmonary veins were identified, and sequential superior and inferior transmural ablation was performed across the back left atrium. A total of 32 points of ablation were performed utilising the 3 cm ablation catheter and 30 W RF energy for 90 seconds at each point. Moreover, the baseline temperature (36 C) was monitored with an oesophagal probe throughout the procedure. If the temperature increased by 1 C more than baseline, ablation was stopped to allow deaeration and waited until temperatures returned to baseline. Each area had multiple ablations until macroscopically the area was discoloured.\\nFollowing pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, 3 left VATS ports (5 mm port in the second intercostal space (ICS), 5 mm port in the mid-axillary line at fourth ICS, and 12 mm port in the sixth ICS in the posterior axillary) line were performed. A double lumen endotracheal tube was placed prior to the beginning of the case. The left lung was deflated, and the pericardium was opened parallel and below the phrenic nerve. The LA appendage was envisioned and measured, and a 35 mm pro-2 Atriclip device were deployed through the lower 12 mm port around the base of the LA appendage. The patient was in sinus rhythm towards the finish of the hybrid procedure after having a single DC cardioversion shock at 200 kJ. The post-procedural period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the first postoperative day with satisfactory biochemical, chest X-ray and echocardiography findings (Figure 1). Postprocedural medication includes Edoxaban, oral Lansoprazole and the patient was advised to come for follow-up in the Electrophysiology clinic after 3 months. The anticoagulant Edoxaban was prescribed as per the Electrophysiology Consultant Cardiologist opinion and on an individual basis dependent upon CHA2DS2VASC score. Though the patient was on a beta-blocker preoperatively, we did not need to restart his beta-blocker postoperatively as the patient was in sinus rhythm and heart rate was 68 beats per minute (regular) till following up at 6 months. Follow-up echocardiography at 6 months was also satisfactory with good biventricular function, and we endeavour to evaluate the patient with a formal Holter monitoring at 1 year postoperatively.\",\n",

Although she had been taking medications over many years, including calcium-channel blocker for hypertension and statin for hyperlipidemia, erlotinib was her only new medication. Then, by 28 days after the start of erlotinib therapy, she presented with severe pruritus of grade 3 according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria. The pruritus was resistant to local application of steroid ointment and to standard systemic therapies, including oral steroids and antihistamines. Furthermore, the pruritus was also linked to acneiform skin rush, leading to the interruption of erlotinib therapy for a period of 2 weeks.\\nAfter recovering from these skin side-effects, she was restarted on erlotinib at a reduced dose of 100 mg/day. Oral steroids and antihistamines were continued to prevent recurrence of the pruritus and skin rush. However, within 2 weeks after restarting erlotinib, severe pruritus of grade 3 developed again, followed by acneiform skin rush especially on her face (Fig. 1). An evaluation of the pruritus by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS), in which a score of 0 indicates no pruritus and a score of 10 indicates the worst pruritus imaginable, resulted in a score of 8.

However, the pruritus and skin rush gradually exacerbated thereafter, leading to scores of 4 and 8 for the pruritus on the VAS within 2 and 4 weeks, respectively (Fig. 3). Then, by starting the second dose of aprepitant, the prompt improvement was again observed within 5 days, leading to a score of 2 for the pruritus on the VAS. However, the pruritus and skin rush eventually exacerbated within 4 weeks. At this point, bi-weekly schedule for aprepitant administration (125 mg on day 1, 80 mg on day 3, and 80 mg on day 5, every 2 weeks) was considered and, then, adopted. As the results, throughout the subsequent treatment with erlotinib, the pruritus and skin rush remained well-controlled within the scores of 2 and 4 for the pruritus on the VAS (Fig. 4).\",\n",

The patient also complained of sudden bilateral decreased visual acuity, more severe on the right side, which preceded the motor deficit by approximately 10 days and had a spontaneously favorable evolution and was partially remitted by the time of admission.\\nAn ophthalmologist in another service evaluated the patient approximately 7 days from the onset of the visual symptoms, where he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. At that moment, he had had mild respiratory symptoms (slight cough and rhinorrhea) for a~2 days. The interval between the onset of the neurological and COVID-19 symptoms was ~5 days.\\nThe ophthalmological examination noted VOS Presbyopia 0.5 sc (0.7 c), VOD PHM, with a regular fundus examination in both eyes. At that time, sight in the left eye was already spontaneously improving, and the diagnosis was right retrobulbar optic neuritis. He was not started on any therapy and received a recommendation for a neurological evaluation and a brain MRI scan. The patient chose to isolate himself at home for 14 days, per the local recommendations at the time.\\nApproximately 3 days into the isolation period, he developed lower limb paresthesia, followed by paraparesis and ataxia, which progressively worsened until he could no longer walk.\\nOur initial clinical examination showed a slight loss of visual acuity in the right eye (he could read a newspaper), asymmetric paraparesis (3/5 MRC on the right, 4/5 MRC on the left), bilateral Babinski sign, distal paresthesia in all limbs, severe bilateral lower limb myoarthrokinetic and vibratory hypoesthesia, with important secondary ataxia, and a T10 sensory level on the left side; walking was impossible.\\nThe full spine MRI revealed a non-enhancing, T2 and STIR hyperintense cervical demyelinating lesion extending from C4 to C7 levels (Figures 1A,B), cervical spondylotic changes, and degenerative lumbar stenosis at L4-L5 levels. The cerebral MRI was unremarkable except for a slight STIR hyperintense signal affecting the right ON, extending posteriorly into the optic chiasm (Figure 2).\\nThe patient was evaluated extensively for autoimmune disorders associated with myelitis, testing negative for ANA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-neuronal antibodies. The infectious screening was negative except for the incidental presence of IgG against HCV. Testing for HIV, syphilis, and borreliosis was negative. The B12 serum level was normal. Serum anti-AQP4 antibodies and anti-MOG antibodies were both positive. The AQP4 was tested by indirect immunofluorescence with a titer of 1:1,000 (N < 1:10). The MOG testing was Western Blot.\\nThe CSF had elevated protein levels (albumin 0.44 g%, positive Pandy test) without pleocytosis (6 elements/muL) and no oligoclonal bands. The IgG index was normal (0.63).\\nGiven the patient's history of optic neuritis, longitudinal extensive cervical myelitis, positive tests for anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies, and the exclusion of other possible causes that could have caused central nervous system demyelination, a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica was reached.\\nThe patient had been treated with iv Methylprednisolone 1,000 mg daily for 5 days with significant improvement of motor function (4-/5 MRC bilaterally) and partial remission of the paresthesia but with the persistence of the objective sensory deficits. The patient was able to walk using a Zimmer frame. He was discharged with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day.\\nAt the 2-month checkup, the patient had continued to improve, presenting with normal visual acuity, asymmetric paraparesis (4-/5 MRC on the right, 4+/5 MRC on the left), bilateral lower limb paresthesia up to the lower half of the thighs, and crural proprioceptive hypoesthesia, still requiring a frame for walking. The cervical MRI showed a slightly favorable evolution of the cervical lesion (Figures 1C,D). As a corticoid-sparing treatment, he was started on Azathioprine (AZA), gradually reaching a dose of 150 mg per day.\\nHe was seen again at the 1-year mark, being stationary from a neurological point of view, with the persistence of the asymmetric paraparesis and sensory anomalies. The cervical MRI examination was discreetly improved, as the intramedullary pathological signal had continued to decrease in area and intensity (Figure 1F). AZA was continued in the same doses while prednisone tapering was initiated.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 63-year-old, HIV-negative woman was referred in June 2000 by a general practitioner to the outpatient pulmonary service because she had exhibited a fever and night sweats for 3 months. The patient\\'s medical history included a mild hypertensive cardiovascular disease and a pulmonary tuberculosis episode when she was 16 years old. Her father and brother had pulmonary tuberculosis. She lived in an urban area and had no history of acoholism, smoking, or use of steroids or immunosuppressive drugs. No other pulmonary diseases that could potentially lead to bronchiectasis and further mycobacterial colonization were reported. Physical examination revealed no pathologic findings except a strong positive reaction (24 mm of induration) with tuberculin skin test (5 U of purified protein derivative-standard [PPD-S]). Results of clinical laboratory tests were unremarkable, apart from an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h). A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed multifocal bronchiectases in the middle right lobe, multiple small nodules in the lower right lobe, and a cavitary lesion in the upper right lobe, which appeared to have thin walls and was surrounded by a scant or absent inflammatory reaction. Bronchoscopy showed no inflammatory mucosal changes on the right side. Smears of bronchial washings were negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and smears of two sputum specimens were positive, while all specimens gave negative results when tested by a ligase chain reaction commercial assay specific for MTB. A reactivation of tuberculosis was assumed, and chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol was begun. Cultures of bronchial washing and sputum specimens produced a slow-growing Mycobacterium, which was identified as M. celatum in July 2000. The isolate was not considered clinically important, and chemotherapy was unchanged.\\nIn December 2000, although the general condition of the patient had slightly improved after 6 months of treatment, a control CT scan showed a worsening (enlargement) of the nodular lesions. Smears of two sputum specimens and one bronchial washing specimen were positive for AFB, whereas all specimens were negative when tested by the MTB ligase chain reaction assay. All of these specimens yielded M. celatum. On the basis of susceptibility data obtained from the first M. celatum isolate, chemotherapy was changed to a schedule that included isoniazid, ethambutol, and clarithromycin, which lasted until November 2001. This regimen proved to be well tolerated by the patient. The bacteriologic results (specimens from two additional bronchial washings were negative for AFB by smear and culture) and clinical response were good. In December 2001, chest x-ray examinations and a CT scan showed a considerable reduction of nodular lesions as well as improvement of lung cavitation (Figure). The patient was considered cured after taking medication for approximately 18 months.\\nClinical, microbiologic, and radiologic data as well, as information on response to treatment and follow-up, were obtained from the patient\\'s records. All material was carefully reviewed to evaluate the clinical significance of the findings according to the criteria proposed by the American Thoracic Society.\\nWe examined sputum and bronchoaspirate specimens for acid-fast organisms. They were stained with routine Ziehl-Neelsen stain and cultured by standard procedures by using a combination of radiometric Bactec system (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, Sparks, MD) and Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Amplification for MTB was performed by the LCx-MTB assay (Abbott, Diagnostics Division, Chicago, IL). Conventional identification and growth tests were performed according to standard methods. We tested recovered strains with the Accuprobe system using specific probes for MAC and MTB. Assays were run from liquid culture setting the unbound probe hydrolysis incubation time at 5 and 10 min and temperature at 60  +- 1 C. The amount of chemiluminescence emitted was estimated with a Leader 50 luminometer (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and quantified as relative light units (RLUs). Definitive identification was achieved by mycolic acids high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Drug susceptibility pattern was determined in 12B liquid medium (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) by using the radiometric macrodilution method developed for MAC.\\nSix isolates were recovered in a 6-month period. M. celatum was isolated from different specimens: two isolates were from bronchial washing and four from sputum. Acid-fast smears were positive in five of the six specimens. Cultures on Lowenstein-Jensen medium yielded multiple colonies, ranging from 100-150 CFU to a confluent growth. No additional microorganisms were isolated during the admission and follow-up period. Amplification tests performed on all respiratory specimens were repeatedly negative for MTB on smear samples positive and negative for M. celatum. M. celatum strains were isolated on both currently used media, radiometric liquid medium (Bactec 12B) and conventional Lowenstein-Jensen solid medium. We used an extended panel of biochemical and cultural tests for conventional identification. On the basis of these test results, the most likely identification, estimated by a program for the computerized identification of mycobacteria, appeared to be M. avium-intracellulare (Table). All strains isolated from this patient produced a weak yellow pigment in the dark, which grew at 45 C and were negative for arylsulfatase activity when tested after 3 days by the method of Kubica and Rigdon. The Bactec NAP test (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) did not demonstrate, as expected, any inhibition by para-nitro-alpha-acetilamino-beta-hydroxypropiophenone (NAP). The hybridization test performed with Accuprobe specific for MAC gave negative results. Weak positive or slightly below the cutoff (30,000 RLUs) results were observed with Accuprobe MTB (mean RLU value 51,170; range 28,219-111,365). When selection reagent (unbound probe hydrolysis) incubation time was set at 10 min, M. celatum strains clearly showed negative results (range 5,721-9,574; mean RLU value 7,210). A reference strain (M. tuberculosis ATCC 25177), run in the hybridization assay as a positive control, gave RLUs of 580,321, about 20 times the cut-off value. Finally, the strains were sent to the Mycobacteria Reference Centre in Florence, Italy (Dr. E. Tortoli), and studied by HPLC analysis of mycolic acids. They showed the same profile that allowed all of our strains to be attributed to M. celatum.\\nMICs (mug/mL) determined for the first isolate were the following: streptomycin, 2.0; isoniazid, 0.5; rifampin, >64.0; ethambutol, 2.5; ciprofloxacin, 1.0; ofloxacin, 1.0; clarithromycin, 1.0; ethionamide, 2.5; and rifabutin, 0.5. Drug susceptibility testing was completed after 6 days.\\nWe searched the English-language literature from 1993 to 2001 for all previously reported cases of pulmonary infections with M. celatum in immunocompetent patients. The search yielded two published reports. Descriptions of the clinical signs, radiologic findings, and treatment were not always available, however.\\nClinical and radiographic features of M. celatum pulmonary infection resemble those of tuberculosis and other nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Cough and weight loss are the main symptoms, while pulmonary infiltrates and extensive cavitations have been described in all published reports. Patients did not suffer from any underlying diseases when pulmonary infection with M. celatum was diagnosed and had a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, suggesting immunocompetence. Published data and our findings indicate that M. celatum caused pulmonary disease, and not merely colonization, in the affected patients. Indeed, all of these cases met the American Thoracic Society criteria for the diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease. The patients displayed radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease that could not be attributed to other causes and that was associated in two of three cases with the repeated isolation of the same mycobacterial strain. By contrast, clinical presentation in immunocompromised patients differs greatly, being characterized by interstitial pulmonary infiltrates or by clinical and micobiologic evidence of disseminated disease.\\nM. celatum strains were isolated on currently used liquid media in all reported cases (radiometric Bactec 12B and MB/BacT [Organon Teknika B.V., Boxtel, the Netherlands]), while samples from one of the published case-patients did not grow on conventional Lowenstein-Jensen solid medium, and growth has not been reported for samples from the second case-patient. Data from an extended panel of biochemical and cultural tests for conventional identification have not been reported; however, the appearance of a scotochromogenic pale yellow pigment with growth at 45 C and a negative 3-day arylsulfatase test are in full agreement with our present and previous findings. All strains showed a partial hybridization with Accuprobe MTB, which disappeared after 10 min of incubation with selection reagent. From a practical standpoint, setting the selection time at 10 min is advisable when the Accuprobe identification is performed on a mycobacterial culture grown in a liquid medium. In this situation, the characteristics of mycobacterial colonies cannot be observed and false-positive reactions may lead to misidentification. However, if the Accuprobe assay is carried out on a mycobacterial culture grown on a solid medium, a 5-min selection time is recommended. In this case, the appearance of mycobacterial colonies and their characteristics of growth may help to evaluate Accuprobe results. Thus, a weak positive reaction when testing nontuberculous mycobacteria with the M. tuberculosis complex Accuprobe strongly suggests that the organism is likely to be M. celatum.\\nIn one case, a misleading positive reaction occurred when a clinical sample containing M. celatum was tested for MTB by the Amplified M. tuberculosis direct test (AMTD, Gen-Probe, Inc.). The test amplifies 16S rRNA of Mycobacterium species by transcription-mediated amplification. The resulting amplicons are then detected by a hybridization protection assay by using a probe that targets the same genomic region as the probe of the Accuprobe kit. In our case, when we tested clinical samples by a different amplification system, no false-positive results potentially leading to a delay of appropriate treatment were reported. Patients (including our case-patient) were given different treatment regimens, with three or four antibiotics, mainly ethambutol, rifabutin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. Clinical improvement, as defined by resolution of symptoms and improved radiographic findings (infiltrates and cavitary lesions), was obtained within 6 months after initiation of therapy in two of three patients. One patient who received antimycobacterial therapy died 10 weeks after admission from complications apparently related to the M. celatum infection. Data from necropsy were not reported. Both cured patients showed a marked improvement when clarithromycin was added the chemotherapy regimen; the patient who later died felt better for 3 weeks when his chemotherapy was changed to a new schedule that included clarithromycin. Despite evidence of clinical and radiologic improvement, one patient was still sputum-positive 1 year after the initiation of therapy. In-vitro susceptibility data (when available) seemed to correlate with patients\\' clinical improvement as the MICs of tested drugs were below the serum concentrations achievable during therapy.\\nOur findings show that M. celatum is an infrequent cause of potentially treatable pulmonary disease in immunocompetent subjects. Clinical picture and repeated isolation from respiratory specimens enabled us to consider M. celatum strains as clinically relevant in all the patients reported. Treatment with a three- or four-drug combination, including clarithromycin and ethambutol, should result in considerable reduction in the illness associated with this disease. Although at present only 16S rDNA sequencing or mycolic acid HPLC analysis can confirm M. celatum identification, the most practical way to get a preliminary identification relies on a positive DNA hybridization signal for MTB at 5 min but negative hybridization at 10 min with the Accuprobe test. Finally, although no major immunologic disorder could be detected in these patients, the host\\'s defense failure associated with M. celatum infection suggests a possible \"hidden immunodeficiency\" rather than a true immunocompetence. Recent data on the immunology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections seem to support this hypothesis.',\n",

He had progressive clinical decline requiring near constant noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Dynamic bronchoscopy showed severe expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC) with >90% collapse of the trachea, main stem bronchi, and bronchus intermedius (Figure 1(a)). A stent trial (Figure 1(b)) was performed with placement of three uncovered self-expandable metallic stents in the left mainstem bronchus, distal and mid trachea and right mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius. This resulted in measurable improvements in the quality of life by validated questionnaires at two weeks and the stents were removed.

During the next 3 years, the patient experienced continuous VA improvement. Visual acuity improved to 0.7 (Figure 1d), whilst the visual field has been continuously improving during the follow-up period (Supplementary Figure 3). It is also of interest to note excellent late improvement of color vision.\\nBoth of our patients had genetic testing for LHON after the presentation. They were first tested for three common mutations. Then, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the mtDNA and NGS of the clinical exome (panel for the optic atrophy mutations known at that time) were carried out, followed by whole exome sequencing, which were all negative. For 14 and 12 years, respectively the patients were without a confirmed diagnosis up until recently when they were retested and DNAJC30:c.152G>A pathogenic homozygous variant c.152A>G (p.Tyr51Cys) in DNAJC30:c.152G>A gene was confirmed.\\nA short phenotype description of both patients was included in the article by Jarc Vidmar et al. due to some changes in mtDNA which later were not identified as pathogenic.\\nBoth of our patients had visual acuity improvement which was modest in case 1 (started at year 7 and improved from NADIR off chart to 0.1 during the next 7 years), and significant in case 2 (started at month 14 and continued for the next 2 years to reach stable 0.7 bilaterally). The visual acuity improvement in case 2 was accompanied by an almost complete recovery of the color vision, whilst there was no improvement of color vision in Case 1 (Figure 2). The visual recovery in Case 2 corresponded well to the VA change. During the period of VA deterioration, there was an enlargement of the central scotoma in the visual field. At 14 months, first fenestrations in the visual field appeared and VA started improving (Supplementary Figure 3).\\nThe peripapillary RNFL thickness decreased during the chronic phase in both patients, even with improved and stable visual acuity, and corresponded with the progression of the optic disc atrophy (Supplementary Figures 4, 5). In comparison to the controls, there was significant thinning of 360-degree retinal thickness in both patients (Supplementary Table 2). The greatest thinning was present in superior temporal, temporal, and inferior temporal parts both at 3.5 and 12 years (Supplementary Table 2). When we compared the RNFL thickness between the 3.5 and 12y check-up, Case 1 had an average decrease of the peripapillary RNFL thickness from 47.43 to 44.86 mum RE and from 42.71 to 40.14 mum on the LE. The greatest thinning between 3.5 and 12 y check-ups was noticed in the inferior temporal part of the optic disc (8.77% RE and 13.33 % LE). In Case 2, peripapillary RNFL thickness decreased from an average of 49.14 to 44 mum RE and 51.86 to 43.57 mum LE for all sectors. The greatest thinning was present in the inferior temporal quadrant of the right eye (14.29 %) and the superior temporal quadrant of the left eye (27.87%).\\nCase 2 had significant improvement in visual function which was also confirmed on microperimetry (Supplementary Figure 6). The first microperimetry was performed at month 14, when visual acuity started to improve. As can be seen, at onset, there was abnormal retinal sensitivity (0 dB) at all spots. The second recording was made 3.5 years after the onset, with the visual acuity bilaterally 0.7 when the mean sensitivity (MS) significantly improved (RE 6.3 dB +- 4.6 dB; range, 0-14 dB; LE 6.5dB +- 6.1dB; range 0-18 dB). The biggest MS improvement was noticed in temporal and nasal macular areas. At the last follow-up, MS somewhat decreased (RE 4.3 dB +- 4.7 dB, range 0-18 dB; LE 4.8 dB +- 5.03 dB, range 0-14 dB). The MS decreased on average RE 2 dB +- 3.9 dB and LE 1.75 dB +- 6.3 dB. Spatially, the most functional were the peripheral regions, especially the nasal and temporal macular area, while the lowest function was detected in the superior and inferior parafoveal region and in the area corresponding to the foveal center (Supplementary Figure 6). Fixation was relatively stable and almost central on all three visits (Supplementary Figure 6).\\nBoth of our patients had thinning of the overall retina, RNFL, GCL, and IPL in all ETDRS quadrants in comparison to healthy controls, whilst the outer retinal layers were well-preserved in comparison (Supplementary Figures 7-9).\\nThe delayed and decreased VEP P100 wave in the acute phase of the disease were present in both patients (Figures 1a,c). Case 1 had normal PERG at the first visit, while the N95/P50 ratio became abnormal 3 months later. At the last visit 4 years later, the quality of PERG recording was poor (probably due to problems with fixation caused by low visual acuity), however, an abnormal N95/P50 ratio was seen at least on the left eye, whilst the VEP P100 wave became undetectable. In Case 2, the amplitude of the N95 wave improved, but it remained abnormally shaped and at the level of the isoelectric line; the N95/P50 ratio remained abnormal (under 1), indicating dysfunction of retinal ganglion cells. The amplitude of the P 100 wave improved, but the latency remained delayed (Supplementary Figure 10).',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'An 81-year-old grand-multiparous woman (G10 P8) presented to our clinic complaining of a vaginally protruding mass and urinary incontinence. The urinary incontinence was mixed (urgency and stress incontinence); however, the SUI component was dominant. Her past medical history was unremarkable. The general systemic physical examination was normal. On pelvic examination, total pelvic organ prolapse with anterior-posterior and apical prolapse (grade IV) was noted (Figure 1). A surgical approach including vaginal hysterectomy, anterior four-arm mesh implant, posterior large segment vaginal enterocele repair, and perineoplasty with levator ani fixation was planned.\\nOn the operation day, the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position under spinal anesthesia. A pericervical circular incision was performed on the vaginal mucosa. The vesicovaginal cleavage plane was found, and the bladder was retracted anteriorly. From the posterior of the cervix, peritoneal entry into posterior cul-de-sac was accomplished. Bilateral cardinal ligaments and sacrouterine ligaments were clamped with Heaney clamps, cut, and suture ligated. Bilateral uterine arteries were clamped, cut, and suture ligated. The anterior cul-de-sac peritoneum was opened. The uterine fundus was held with clamp and pulled out from the vagina by tumbling it backwards. Bilateral round ligaments, uteroovarian ligaments, and bilateral fallopian tubes were clamped, cut, and doubly ligated. McCall culdoplasty was performed with high peritonization. The vaginal cuff was closed in a continuous fashion with 2/0 polyglactin suture. The vaginal hysterectomy was thereby completed. A linear incision was performed on the anterior vaginal mucosa, on about 2.5 cm below the external urethral opening, and the space was dissected until reaching the bladder base. Vesicovaginal ligaments were retracted laterally. Proximal part of the mesh was passed over arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP) with an obturator fossa guide. The posterior part of the four-arm mesh was passed through the obturator foramen (Figure 2). The anterior arms were placed as a midurethral sling as in the intravaginal slingplasty (IVS) procedure, supporting the midurethra and bladder (Figure 3). Posterior fringes of the mesh were fixed on sacrouterine and cardinal ligaments. About an 8-10 cm piece of monofilament, inelastic polypropylene tape is attached to the underside of the vaginal apex. Polypropylene sutures are placed into both of the sacrospinous and cardinal ligaments and threaded through the lateral edges of the apical sling and tied down, restoring apical support. Posterior mesh arms were fixed at the skin level by performing traction, but anterior part was not fixed at the midurethra and skin level, and tension free placement was performed.\\nVagina mucosa was sutured in a continuous locking fashion with 2/0 polyglactin suture. In the same session, rectocele repair was performed. Rectovaginal fascial dissection was performed from posterior vagina and grade IV posterior prolapse was dissected broadly up to the apical region. Fascial defect was repaired with 2/0 polyglactin suture and a purse suture was placed. Excess vaginal mucosa was excised. A horizontal incision was made on the perineum, and perineoplasty was performed by enhancing puborectalis muscle medial region fixation. The vaginal mucosa and perineum were repaired using 2/0 polyglactin suture. Hemostasis was confirmed and the operation was concluded by placing a gauze tampon in the vagina. There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications.\\nThe patient was discharged home at the second postoperative day. Follow-up visits at the first, 3rd, and 6th months were normal. There was complete symptomatic relief and objective cure of the POP and urinary incontinence symptoms.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 53-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our Psychiatry Unit for hospitalization by her general practitioner. Anamnestic data collection revealed that the patient had had a difficult adolescence, due to the fact that her father had had a mistress and suffered from pathologic gambling. Notwithstanding, she had not experienced any previous psychopathologic problems in the past. She was a housewife with two daughters, and the eldest daughter had always been in conflict with her mother. On the day of her admission to hospital, the patient had a fatuous expression, seemed apathetic, and was suffering from considerable psychomotor retardation. She was distrustful of other patients because they were \"too intrusive\". However, when approaching other patients, she showed a childish attitude and was disrespectful of conventional interpersonal distances. The patient had the delusional belief that her eldest daughter, whom she thought had disappeared for 12 months, had been replaced by an impostor. In fact, the previous year the patient\\'s daughter had left her house without telling her mother. The patient tried to get in touch with her, and the girl answered the phone saying that she was at work. Because her workplace was quite far off from her house, the patient thought that it was not possible for her daughter to arrive at work in such a short time. Hence, she believed that the person she had spoken to over the phone was an impostor who was replacing the daughter whom she thought had disappeared.\\nHer delusional belief was characterized by incorrigibility and unwarranted subjective conviction. The patient had two \"proofs\" to justify her belief: the distance of the workplace and the impostor\\'s makeup, which was heavier than that worn by her daughter.\\nThe patient was experiencing not only the tragedy of a mother who had lost her daughter, but also the frustration of continuous deception by the \"double\"/impostor. Indeed, the patient thought that the \"double\" was imitating her daughter\\'s way of speaking so as to convince her (the patient) that she (the \"double\") was her daughter. The patient had no idea where her daughter could be. However, she did nothing to find out where she was. In addition, even though she considered the impostor to be a menacing presence, the patient had a passive attitude towards the impostor, and treated her with indifference. Her mood was deflected owing to her daughter\\'s disappearance. Obviously, the patient had no insight into her illness. The Capgras delusion was the only unusual belief presented by this patient, who did not show any other psychotic symptoms. The clinical picture of this patient was peculiar: she was tormented by the thought of the \"double\" who, in addition, provoked a feeling of disgust. This feeling was caused by the fact that the \"double\" treated the patient in a confidential way in order to deceive her without feeling any real affection. This thought, which was particularly intrusive, caused her considerable distress and even disturbed her sleep; almost every night, she had difficulty in falling asleep at the thought of the painful condition of deception that she had to endure. In addition, this delusional belief was presented to the medical interviewers in an obsessive way, with perseveration regarding the subject (she constantly repeated that the woman was not her daughter), and the thought content restricted to it. The story about her daughter was the answer to simple questions that had nothing to do with the topic. The intrusive thoughts pertaining to her daughter\\'s disappearance and to the impostor were always present and did not fluctuate much over time.\\nGeneral physical examination was within normal limits. She did not drink alcohol or coffee, and did not use any illicit or recreational drugs. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 27/30, indicating normal cognition. Items of the MMSE that the patient was less able to complete pertained to calculation and to short-term and long-term memory. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders indicated an unspecified personality disorder, with a preponderance of paranoid and obsessive-compulsive personality traits. The electroencephalogram was characterized by background alpha activity and rapid rhythms in the frontocentral regions, bilaterally, as shown in Figure 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (images obtained through fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, spin echo, and turbo field echo techniques, diffusion weighted in axial, sagittal, and coronal planes) showed moderate lesions in the frontal subcortical white matter and in the semioval centers on both sides. In particular, in long repetition time sequences, these cerebral areas showed hyperintensities compatible with a picture of gliosis, as shown in Figure 2.',\n",

The swelling was gradually increasing in size and was accompanied with mild pain. The pain was dull, continuous, and limited to the site of the lesion. She also complained of neck stiffness and pain on neck movements. There was no history of any injury. History of cough, weight loss, night cries (severe pain at night), and low grade fever was present for the past 4 months. There was no history of previous tuberculosis or contact with an open case of tuberculosis. She had been prescribed several antibiotics and analgesics at another centre but had no symptomatic improvement. On physical examination the swelling (2 x 3 cm) was present over right sternoclavicular joint and was associated with presence of mild tenderness, erythema, and local rise of temperature. Laboratory tests revealed haemoglobin of 10.4 gm%; total leukocyte count was 10.300/mm3. Her ESR was 34 mm in first hour. She was negative for HIV based on ELISA method. On radiographic evaluation there was destruction with sclerosis on the medial end of the right clavicle along with features of diffuse pulmonary infiltrate (Figure 2). MRI revealed bilateral upper lung lobe infiltrate with arthritis of right sternoclavicular joint, with regional fluid collection. A destruction of the atlanto-axial junction, D7-8 intervertebral disc space along with a pus collection from D5 to D8 region could also be appreciated (Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c)). An early morning sputum sample was sent for Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining and it came out positive suggesting the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Fine needle aspiration of the right sternoclavicular lesion was done using a 22-gauge needle and sent for Gram staining, staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), histopathology, and cultures including a tubercular culture. The histologic picture was that of chronic inflammation with a caseating granuloma compatible with tuberculosis. The Ziehl-Neelsen stained smear also showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB), confirming the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis came out as negative. Antitubercular chemotherapy with four first line antitubercular drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) was started. The patient had a good clinical response within 6 weeks and was switched to three drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) after 3 months of therapy with four drugs. The clinical, haematological, and radiological parameters showed complete healing of the lesion after 1 year of treatment with ATT, which was further continued for a total duration of 18 months. After successfully completing the therapy for 18 months, the patient was followed up for 2 years and showed no recurrence of symptoms.',\n",

Histologic examination showed invasive BSCC. He underwent wide local excision, with the closest peripheral margin reported at 1 mm. He then received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (45 Gray (Gy) in 15 fractions) due to the narrow margins. Two years later, he developed cutaneous recurrence at the periphery of the radiation field with clinical right axillary lymphadenopathy. A biopsy of the cutaneous lesion and fine needle aspiration of the right axillary lymph node confirmed a locally metastatic BSCC. He subsequently underwent a right axillary complete lymph node dissection with 3/18 positive nodes. He was treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and 54 Gy of external beam radiation in 30 daily fractions to the right axilla and supraclavicular lymph nodes.\\nHe had stable disease without recurrence until 9 years later, when he developed new onset neurological symptoms including headaches and photopsia. A subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 4.2 cm, large, irregular tumor in the right occipital lobe (Figure 1). He underwent parieto-occipital craniotomy for gross total resection of the tumor, with histological examination demonstrating BSCC. He then received adjuvant fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (30 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week). A staging computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any other evidence of metastasis. Post-craniotomy, his neurologic symptoms returned; however, repeat biopsy revealed necrotic brain tissue without malignancy. He is routinely seen in follow-up and is currently stable, without evidence of relapse. Immunotherapy will be trialed if there is evidence of disease progression.\\nAll the biopsies were retrospectively reviewed. Identical features of BSCC were present in all samples (Figure 2(a)). P16 immunohistochemistry was performed on samples from the brain lesions, which showed strong and diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity (Figure 2(b)).

       "    'case_text': 'A G2P2 36-year-old female presented to her primary care physician for enlarged cervical and axillary lymph nodes in December 2010. She had no relevant family history nor known comorbidities apart from obesity (BMI: 33.9 kg/m2). The two previous pregnancies and deliveries had been uneventful. A routine blood test showed leucocytosis and lymphocytosis (55.340/mcl and 35.417/mcl, respectively), with mild anaemia (haemoglobin 11.5 g/dl). The immunophenotype of the peripheral blood revealed monoclonal B-lymphocytes (CD5+, CD23+) compatible with B-CLL. A fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) test showed a chromosome 13 deletion (13DS319). A whole-body computerised tomography (CT) scan confirmed multiple pathological lymph nodes at cervical, mediastinal, axillary, coeliac, hepatic, and retroperitoneal stations. She received rituximab/cladribine combination for 4 cycles followed by maintenance rituximab every 2 months for a total of eight administrations. No significant toxicities were reported and the patient achieved a clinical and radiological complete response, with minimal circulating residual disease. Seventeen months after the end of rituximab, the patient got unintentionally pregnant. Her white blood cell count was 15.350/mcl with 9.970 lymphocytes/mcl, and all the other haematological parameters were within the norm. A cervical, axillary, and inguinal ultrasound was normal and the embryo was well implanted. At 28 weeks gestation, a glucose curve demonstrated gestational diabetes that was treated with diet and subcutaneous insulin. The foetal parameters were normal, without intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or macrosomia. At 32 weeks gestation, the patient presented with high fever, shivering, and cough. A thoracic ultrasound performed demonstrated left lobar pneumonia that was successfully treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and clarithromycin. At 34 weeks, the patient developed cholestasis with elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia and pruritus treated with ursodesossicholic acid; at 36+ weeks gestation, steroids were administered in order to increase the foetal pulmonary surfactant, as an amniocentesis performed showed that full foetal maturity was not yet reached. Because of the concomitant presence of cholestasis and suspicion of maternal disease progression (progressive leucocytosis, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia) an increased risk of endouterine death was recognised and anticipation of labour was decided. Therefore, at 37 + 4/7 weeks, labour was induced with cervical prostaglandins and the patient delivered a healthy 3,580 g female baby, with an Apgar score of 10/10 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. There were no obstetric or neonatal postpartum complications. Four months after delivery, her lymphocyte count started to increase and an ultrasound assessment showed several pathological lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, hepatic). She remained under close observation with monthly haematological and clinical examinations. At the time of this report, she is still under surveillance without any treatment.',\n",

On examination, body temperature was 37.9  C, oxygen saturation was 98 % while breathing ambient air, other vital signs were normal. She looked pale but was comfortable. The lungs were clear on auscultation, with no crackles nor rhonchi. There were no lymphadenopathies noted, further clinical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings (Table 1) showed a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dl (normal value, >12 g/dl), an elevated C-reactive protein level of 32 mg/L (normal value, <5 mg/l), a normal total white blood count with neutrophilic predominance. Electrolytes and liver function were normal. Creatinine level was in line with previous values. Additional medical history included nephrectomy of the right native kidney in 2016 at the time of transplantation and cytomegalovirus reactivation early after transplantation for which a 3 months course of valganciclovir was administered. Maintenance medication consisted of mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg daily, tacrolimus 4,5 mg/day and a calcium/vitamin D supplement. The patient was born in Suriname. She lived there until she was 7 years old and then moved to the Netherlands. She moved to Belgium at the age of 11, where she currently resides. There was no history of recent travels outside Europe. She had never smoked. The donor was a 50 year old male originally from Flanders, Belgium who died from a head trauma in a traffic accident. He had no medical history, took no maintenance medication and had a negative infectious screening at the time of donation except for a positive CMV serology. There were no post-transplant diseases reported in the other organ recipients.\\nOn admission a bronchoscopy was first performed, which was macroscopically normal. Cultures and a respiratory PCR panel of the lavage fluid were obtained. Colonoscopy showed a bulging mass arising from the ileocecal valve, suspicious for a tumoral process from which biopsies were taken (Fig. 2).\\nHence, a tentative diagnosis of a colorectal tumor was made. However, given the patient's immunocompromised state and the bilateral patchy lung infiltrates, the suspicion of a concomitant opportunistic lung infection remained.\\nConsidering the hypothesis of colon cancer, additional abdominal imaging was warranted. A positron emission tomography-CT (PET/CT) with 18F-fluorodexyglucose (18F-FDG) was performed to evaluate the lung lesions, and as a staging tool for the putative colon cancer. PET/CT showed multiple mesenteric lymph nodes and a tumoral mass in the terminal ileum at the ileocecal valve and one in the descending colon (Fig. 3). These radiographic findings were highly suspicious for an underlying post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). In contrast, the diffuse pulmonary nodules and opacities throughout both lungs were rather suspected to be of infectious origin. There were hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies in the right lung hilum and at the right-sided pretracheal level (4R).\\nDuring the patient's hospital stay, she developed intermittent high-grade fever (40  C) together with increasing C-reactive protein level (100 mg/L). Otherwise she remained in general good condition, without oxygen need. Repetitive blood cultures were all sterile.\\nIn addition, cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage came back negative, including auramine staining and culture for acid-fast bacilli, as was aspergillus antigen (galactomannan). The respiratory panel (polymerase-chain-reaction, PCR) showed only the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which was being considered clinically irrelevant. PCR for cytomegalovirus and pneumocystis pneumonia were also negative.\\nAdditional blood tests were negative for Epstein-Barr virus DNA but revealed an increased blood level of 1,3- beta-d-glucan (90 pg/mL; <60 pg/mL: negative; >80 pg/mL: positive) and negative galactomannan (index 0.3).\\nSince there was still no clear diagnosis, the patient was referred to the abdominal surgery department for an exploratory laparoscopy with lymph node excision for pathological examination, culture, panbacterial PCR and panfungal PCR.\\nWhile awaiting the results of the lymph node specimen, the pathological examination of the ileocecal mass became available. It showed inflammation with lymphocytes and histocytes without signs of malignancy. In the cytoplasm of the histocytes rounded organisms were identified (Fig. 4). Grocott's methenamine silver stain revealed organisms morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, these results were later reproduced on the lymph node biopsy. Eventually, culture and panfungal PCR of the lymph node confirmed the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum.\\nA diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis with pulmonary and intestinal involvement was convincingly made and the patient was started on high dose itraconazole (loading dose of 200 mg three times daily for three days, subsequently twice daily). At that time, we took a thorough lifelong travel history which revealed travels to North America (New York City and Washington D.C.), Suriname and Indonesia more than 20 years prior to transplantation.\\nThe patient remained febrile throughout the first two weeks of antifungal therapy. Itraconzole blood concentrations were within the therapeutic range (1-2 mg/L). Tacrolimus oral dose had to be reduced from 4.5 mg daily to 0.5 mg/day as a result of the known drug-drug interaction between itraconazole and tacrolimus in order to maintain target concentrations. Approximately after one month of treatment, the patient was discharged from the hospital while continuing to have a cough and fatigue, whereas the fever resolved, and her C-reactive protein level decreased to near normal.\\nTen days after discharge the patient was readmitted with diffuse abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She reported absence of stool for 5 days. On clinical examination the abdomen was distended, no muscle resistance observed, and bowel sounds were reduced. CT revealed a small bowel obstruction secondary to thickening of an ileal intestinal segment. The patient was conservatively managed with intravenous fluid, a nasogastric tube in suction and she was put on IV posaconazole as IV itraconazole is not available in Belgium. While this strategy initially seemed successful, one-week later symptoms recurred and a decision for surgery was made. Laparoscopic resection of two small bowel segments was performed. Histological examination of both specimens confirmed active histoplasmosis infection as the underlying cause of obstruction. Six out of 10 resected lymph nodes also showed signs of active infection. After regaining intestinal transit, oral itraconazole was restarted with a 3-day loading dose and continued at a maintenance dose of 2 x 200 mg/day for a planned duration of 12 months. Five weeks after discharge from the hospital the patient started to have improved appetite and regained weight. Fever and cough had disappeared. A plain chest x-ray demonstrated partial regression of the lung lesions. Itraconazole blood concentration remained within the therapeutic range.\",\n",

At the visit to an ophthalmologist, he was found to have a large nonpigmented dome-shaped choroidal mass in the superotemporal quadrant of the midperipheral fundus of the right eye, associated with serous subretinal fluid, which extended to the macular area and inferior to the choroidal mass (Figure 1A and B). The vitreous and anterior chamber in the right eye had no pigments or cells. The left eye had nothing particular. The best-corrected visual acuity in decimals was 0.4 in the right eye and 1.2 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye.

He had no systemic symptoms and was well with daily medications of amlodipine 10 mg, benidipine 4 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, lansoprazole 15 mg, precipitated calcium carbonate 1000 mg, calcium polystyrene sulfonate 1000 mg, cinacalcet hydrochloride 25 mg, and pantethine 300 mg. He also took intravenous injection of maxacalcitol 5 microg 3 times a week at the time of hemodialysis and subcutaneous injection of darbepoetin alfa 40 microg once a week.\\nWith the diagnosis of metastatic choroidal tumor, primary and other metastatic sites were searched for by whole-body 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET (FDG-PET). Abnormal uptake was found in the prostate (standardized uptake value [SUVmax] = 4.75; Figure 2C), vertebral bones (SUVmax = 8.01; Figure 2D), bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (SUVmax = 5.77; Figure 2E), and bilateral lung fields, in addition to the right eye (SUVmax = 3.31; Figure 2B). The combined computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple lung-field nodular lesions on both sides (Figure 2F), indicative of metastatic lesions in the lung. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed an intraocular mass with mildly high T1-weighted signal, mildly low T2-weighted signal, and high diffusion-weighted signal in the right eye (Figure 2A), but no intracranial abnormalities. He was referred to a urologist for prostate cancer as the primary site. Serum PSA was extremely elevated to 541 ng/mL, which supported prostate cancer as the primary site. He began to receive subcutaneous injection of degarelix acetate at the initial dose of 240 mg, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks. One month after the initial visit, the choroidal tumor resolved rapidly and became flat degeneration in response to the initial dose of hormonal therapy (Figure 1C). Two months after the initial visit, needle biopsy of the prostate showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 (Figure 3A and B), which was indeed a presumed value as he was under hormonal therapy. He immediately underwent surgical castration, and degarelix was discontinued.\\nOne year after the initial visit, the serum PSA in the patient with no medication remained at the low level of 0.48 ng/mL. The serum PSA was gradually elevated to 2.34 ng/mL 2 years after the initial visit, further elevated to 3.56 ng/mL 3 years after the initial visit, and to 6.05 ng/mL in the following 3 months. CT scan demonstrated multiple bony osteosclerotic metastases in thoracic and lumbar vertebrae but no metastasis in the liver or lymph nodes. At this time point, therefore, he began to take oral bicalutamide 8 mg daily, and in 1 month, the serum PSA decreased to 0.61 ng/mL. The serum PSA was elevated again to 1.22 ng/mL 5 years after the initial visit, and thus, bicalutamide was replaced with enzalutamide at a full dose, 160 mg daily, leading to the decrease of serum PSA to 0.38 ng/mL in 2 weeks. In a month, however, because of hypertension, the administration of enzalutamide was reduced to half a dose 80 mg daily, and in another month, was replaced with abiraterone acetate at half a dose, 500 mg daily in combination with prednisolone 10 mg daily. The serum PSA became an undetectable level (<0.009 ng/mL) in 2 weeks. The patient was well with hemodialysis and maintained the undetectable PSA level with continuous abiraterone until the latest follow-up 6.8 years after the initial visit. Throughout the course, the right eye showed flat retinal regeneration corresponding to the area of the previous choroidal tumor (Figure 1D). The best-corrected visual acuity was 1.0 in both eyes.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 12-year-old male child with a 3-month history of bilateral, constant, radiating lower limb, and back pain was brought to Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital (IRCH) by his father. The patient described the pain as an aching, throbbing, stabbing pain, and rated it a 9/10 on the Verbal Analogue Scale (VAS). He stated that he had not been able to walk or do any of his regular physical activities for a month. He had associated weakness and paresthesias in his legs bilaterally. He was unable to sleep at night for the past 2 weeks, due to back pain that was elicited by lying down. The patient also had associated constipation and urinary retention for which he had to be catheterized.\\nWhen the patient came to the pain clinic, he was held in his father\\'s arms, as the patient was paralyzed from the waist down. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in severe pain. Deep tendon reflexes were not present in bilateral lower limbs. Muscle strength was 2/5 on the Oxford Scale (muscle strength grading scale) in bilateral limbs (hip/knee/ankle). Sensation to pinprick and soft touch were diminished over the gluteal regions and legs. Upon palpation of the patient\\'s legs, he felt electricity running through his legs. The patient denied any other symptoms.\\nIn March 2015, the patient had sudden onset of excruciating left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In April 2015, he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and excision of a growth between the spleen and renal space. Pathology reports suggested the growth was a CD99 and vimentin-positive YST. Further tests were conducted such as an ultrasound to see if there was any involvement of the testes. Results showed no gonadal involvement.\\nThe patient\\'s father stated that the patient was attending school, running, and was pain-free until 15 days postoperatively. The doctors at his local hospital were unable to find the etiology of his postoperative pain. The patient was referred to a different hospital for consultation. A CT scan was done that showed a heterogeneous mass in the left suprarenal region, suggestive of a residual mass that was infiltrating the posterior abdominal wall and muscle. A whole abdomen contrast-enhanced computed tomography (nonionic CECT) revealed a devascularized left kidney possibly due to left renal artery injury. After various inconclusive testing, the patient was referred to IRCH (AIIMS.)\\nAt the time of the patient\\'s presentation at IRCH his condition had progressively worsened. He had developed bilateral paralysis, severe lower lumbar back pain, and bilateral leg pain. Many investigations were initiated which included complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, complete metabolic panel, blood test checking for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, comparison CECT scan, ultrasound of neck to check for lymph node involvement.\\nCBC showed hemoglobin was 10.4 (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dl for males), thin layer chromatography was 24.8 (normal range: 4000-11,000). Liver function tests showed that bilirubin levels were below the normal range at 0.2 mg% (normal range: 0.8-1 mg%), TSH and beta-HCG were within normal limits, but AFP 3 was 0.52 ng/ml (normal range: 0.89-8.78 ng/ml). Ultrasound of the neck showed no sign of metastasis to lymph nodes or glands. The CECT scan was unchanged compared to the previous scan. The mass seen previously was causing erosion of the left 12th rib with extension into neural foramina with suspicious intraspinal extension. No metastatic lung nodules were visible.\\nBased on the patient\\'s history, physical exam and investigations, the diagnosis of primary retroperitoneal extragonadal YST extending into the neural foramina of the spinal cord at L1/L2 was made. The metastasis was causing compression of the spinal cord producing his paralysis. For management of this patient the medical oncologist, surgical oncologist, and radiologist were consulted. Due to the extent of cancer, further surgery was no longer an option. Although the paralysis was not reversible, the pain, with the help of proper pain management, and palliative care team was treatable.\\nWhile interacting with the patient and his father, I could see that the patient\\'s father was distraught about his son\\'s condition. Medical treatments for the patient had taken a financial toll on the family. The patient\\'s father had to sell off his land where he was farming in Patna, Bihar in order to pay for proper treatments. He expressed to me that he was willing to sell his house too if it meant we could make his son walk again. The patient\\'s mother became severely depressed and threatened to commit suicide if her son\\'s health did not improve. Despite explaining that at this stage only the pain of the patient could be managed and that the paralysis was permanent, the father was in denial. He kept saying, \"Please make my son walk again, that is, all I want.\" Family bonds are reasonably vulnerable during the time of distress, and the entire palliative care team provided a positive and supportive environment so that they could communicate their needs most effectively.\\nThe patient was initially started on infusion morphine, which was dose titrated appropriately and later converted to tablet morphine. Dexamethasone was prescribed to reduce the swelling caused by the compression of the spinal cord. He was given gabapentin for the neuropathic pain, which was converted, to tablet pregabalin. Studies suggest pregabalin provides equivalent efficacy to gabapentin, however, at much lower doses. Because lower dosages can be used to treat neuropathic pain, it is likely that pregabalin will be associated with fewer dose-related adverse events such as dizziness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and constipation. Pregabalin requires lower dosages, has a much higher bioavailability (90% vs. 33-66% of gabapentin) and is rapidly absorbed (peak: 1 h).\\nMorphine reduced the pain from 9/10 to 4/10 on the VAS. To further relieve the patient\\'s pain, we discussed chemotherapy and attempting a nerve block. The father cited apprehensions for both of these treatment options. The patient\\'s father was explained the positive impact the procedure would have on relieving his son\\'s pain, and that his son would be able to sleep peacefully and be pain-free. He was told giving chemotherapy would not have reversed the neurological deficit but would have definitely reduced the pain by treating the cause. The father had seen many unfortunate situations about what can happen after chemotherapy is given and explained to us how he knew some people that had died in his village after chemotherapy was given. He was further explained all the benefits chemotherapy would have on not only the pain the patient was experiencing but also in slowing down the progression of metastasis. All his questions were addressed, and he was told that the situation in which other people might have received chemotherapy might be different than his son\\'s. When explained how attempting a nerve block could be beneficial, the father again refused and said he heard it would permanently damage his son\\'s nerves. The whole palliative care team made many efforts to make the patient\\'s father understand exactly how these treatments would be given as well as how all the side effects would be managed for both the nerve block and chemotherapy, but the father was convinced that these will only cause harm to his son based on what he had seen and what people told him about these medical advances in his village. Even after multiple attempts of ensuring the father that this would be the next best option for his son\\'s pain, consent was not given, so these treatments were not given. One of the major components of palliative care is respect for patient\\'s autonomy. Due to lack of health literacy there are many proven, working treatments that are simply not done.\\nThe patient\\'s pain was managed based on the World health Organizations Cancer pain protocol (WHO ladder). This included the analgesics tablet Morphine (P) 10 mg three tablets 4 hourly, tablet paracetamol (acetaminophen) 500 mg one tablet QID and tablet pregabalin 75 mg HS x 6 weeks. Anti-emetics were given to avoid nausea and vomiting, the patient was experiencing. For GI ulcer prophylaxis tablet pantoprazole 40 mg once daily was prescribed. Tablet dexamethasone 4 mg TDS x 7 days was also given and later changed to 2 mg TDS x 7 days. After monitoring the patient\\'s pain and bringing it down to a 3/10 on the VAS, the patient was counseled and sent to a nonprofit organization called Cankids (Cankids is a registered charitable national society working to make a change for childhood cancer in India.) There, he would receive further pain management treatments and psychosocial support through counseling for him and his family.',\n",

She presented to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Center of Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul for treatment of her dentofacial deformity, with a chief complaint of difficulty chewing with the front teeth. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report, including accompanying images, and the manuscript was written in accordance with the CARE criteria.\\nA cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was performed using an i-CAT system (Image Sciences International, Hatfield, PA, USA). Three-dimensional (3D) images were constructed using Dolphin Software (Dolphin Imaging and Management Solutions, Chatsworth, CA, USA). Surgical planning was based on the patient's chief complaint, facial analysis, and 3D cephalometric analysis. Based on these factors, monomaxillary surgery with Le Fort I osteotomy was chosen for 2 mm advancement of the posterior maxilla and a V-shaped segmental maxillary osteotomy between teeth UR3/4 and UL3/4 for 8  clockwise rotation and 5-mm down repositioning of the premaxilla, thereby modifying occlusion to Angle class I and closing the anterior open bite (Fig. 1D-F). Reconstructions of the segmented osteotomies showed a gap of approximately 4.1 mm in the area between teeth UR3/4 and UL3/4 and approximately 4.8 mm on the floor of the nasal fossa (Fig. 2). As such, the decision was made to place a bone graft.\\nThe patient was placed under hypotensive general anesthesia. The maxillary vestibular approach was used for surgical access and detachment of the nasal fossa mucosa. Next, a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed and, after down fracture, a V-shaped segmental maxillary osteotomy was made between teeth UR3/4 and UL3/4 and behind the incisive foramen to correct the anterior open bite and over-projection of the anterior teeth. Osteotomies were performed using NSK VarioSurg piezoelectric instruments (NSK America Latina Ltda, Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil).\\nThe splint was attached to the orthodontic appliance with a steel wire. Once the maxilla and mandible were stabilized in occlusion, the surgery was considered to be in accordance with the virtual plan. Then, as previously established, bone grafting was performed by placing 2 g of small Bio-oss  granules (Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) into the surgical gaps. These areas were then covered with a Bio-Gide  collagen membrane (Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland).\\nThe maxilla was positioned for rigid internal fixation with bilateral L-shaped miniplates in the zygomatic buttress and bilateral L-shaped microplates around the piriform aperture, to ensure stability of the collagen membranes for bone graft protection (Fig. 3).\\nThe surgical splint remained in place for 30 days with maxillomandibular fixation, after which time the patient was instructed to follow a liquid/semisolid diet and avoids chewing. The overbite improved from -3 mm to 2 mm and overjet from 4 mm to 2 mm, ensuring closure of the anterior open bite and maintaining coordination between the posterior and anterior segments of dental occlusion at Angle class I (Fig. 1G-I) Repeat CBCT performed 6 months after surgery revealed bone formation with density greater than that of the tissue surrounding the segmental maxillary osteotomy, providing stable occlusion (Fig. 4).\",\n",

She went to the local clinic and was given drug treatment (the specific medication is unknown). But the curative effect was poor. She went to the local hospital seven months later and was diagnosed as \"left eye tumor\". Then, she was recommended to go to the superior hospital for diagnosis and treatment.\\nOn 27 January 2021, the patient went to the Lanzhou University Second Hospital and was diagnosed as \"left eyelid tumor\". On 1 February 2021, histopathological diagnosis was: (left eyelid conjunctiva) squamous epithelial papilloma, mild to moderate atypical hyperplasia of epithelium, accompanied by suppurative inflammation. Therefore, \"left eye conjunctival cryosurgery\" was performed under local anesthesia on 22 February 2021 and 16 March 2021.\\nThe patient felt that the tumor in his left eye increased rapidly, accompanied by obvious swelling and pain, loss of vision and difficulty in opening her eyes. She was treated in the first people\\'s hospital of Lanzhou city on 7 April 2021. The diagnosis was: space occupying in the left eye orbit, and surgical treatment was recommended.\\nThe patient was admitted to Lanzhou Huaxia ophthalmic hospital for surgical treatment on 20 April 2021.\\nEye examination: The upper eyelid of the left eye is red and swollen, the dermatoglyphs disappear, and it is difficult to open the eyes. The upper eyelid can touch a size of about 30 mm  x  20 mm mass with unclear boundary, hard texture, poor activity, obvious tenderness, bulbar conjunctival congestion and edema, corneal conjunctivalization, and other structures cannot be seen clearly; the international standard visual acuity chart was used to check the visual acuity: the naked visual acuity was 0.2 in the right eye and no light perception in the left eye; the intraocular pressure was measured by non-contact tonometer: 11.5 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kpa) in the right eye and 46.5 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kpa) in the left eye (Figures 1A-C).\\nOcular ultrasonography: the upper part of the left eyeball is about 30 mm x 19 mm heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with unclear boundary, pressed close to the eyeball wall and sunken into the ball.\\nColor Doppler flow imaging (CDFI): point and strip blood flow signals can be seen in eyeball.\\nEnhanced MRI examination of orbit and orbit: irregular soft tissue signal shadow can be seen in the left orbital diaphragm, inside and outside the muscle cone and lacrimal gland area, which is filled in the orbit as frozen and extends backward into the optic nerve canal. T1W1 shows equal signal, T2W1 and DW1 show slightly high signal, the internal signal is uneven, and the space occupying effect is obvious. The left eyeball is compressed, deformed and moved forward, the eyeball wall collapses, and the left optic nerve is compressed, the external rectus muscle of lacrimal gland was not clearly displayed. The left orbit and optic canal are enlarged, and no abnormality is found in the bone. The enhancement scan was performed immediately after 15 ml gadolinium diamine contrast agent was injected through elbow vein. It showed that the signal shadow of soft tissue in left diaphragm, inside and outside muscle cone and lacrimal gland area was significantly enhanced, and there was spotted low signal shadow inside, and there were no abnormal enhancement changes in the rest (Figures 2A,B).\\nExclude cancer metastasis diagnosis: In order to exclude metastatic cancer, the patient underwent systemic examination, and no abnormality was found in gynecological examination; No space occupying lesions were found in brain MRI, chest x-ray examination, neck and abdominal ultrasonography (liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and double kidneys); No obvious abnormality was found in liver and kidney function and blood routine. Metastatic cancer and systemic lesions can be excluded.\\nLeft eye orbital tumor resection: Due to the patient\\'s old age and the request of her family to retain the patient\\'s eyeball, the \"left eye orbital tumor resection\" was performed under general anesthesia on 22 April 2021. The postoperative histopathological diagnosis was: (left eye) malignant tumor, consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, with extensive infiltration of cancer tissue into stroma and multifocal necrosis (Figures 2C,D).\\nApoptosis detection: The cell apoptosis in patient tumor tissues was detected by mIHC(mutiplex immunohistochemistry). The expression of CASPASE3,8,9 and BCL2, BAX were determined by mIHC. It was showed that all of the apoptosis markers were extensively expressed in the tumor tissues, which infer to there was ubiquitous apoptosis in tumor tissues (Figure 3).\\nThe immune cells infiltration detection: The immune cells infiltration in tumor tissues were detected by mIHC. CD3 is the total T lymphocyte marker, CD4 is the helper T lymphocyte marker, CD8 is the cytotoxic T lymphocyte marker, CD11C is the natural killer cell, and F480 is the macrophage marker. It was showed that there were lots of CD3, CD4, CD8 and F480 expression in tumor tissues, except for CD11C (Figure 4).',\n",

So far, clinical symptoms had always been well-controlled by pyridostigmine, azathioprine, and low doses of steroids. Last neurological examination, performed 2 months earlier, revealed only mild diplopia on left lateral gaze after prolonged fixation.\\nThe patient also suffered from a mild iatrogenic chronic sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy due to chemotherapy administered after surgical resection of colon cancer; he also underwent ablation of two metastatic lesions in the liver, but the subsequent oncological follow-up was reported negative.\\nOn admission, neurological examination revealed diplopia on lateral gaze, limitation in upward gaze, mild ptosis of the left eye after prolonged fixation, uncertainties at finger-to-nose test, mild proximal limb muscles fatigability, and absence of knee and Achilles reflexes. Brain CT scan and chest X-rays were negative.\\nA putative diagnosis of worsening of myasthenia gravis was made and the patient was hospitalized due to concerns of respiratory failure, considering the age and the recent infection. Absence of lower limbs deep tendon reflexes was initially ascribed to the polyneuropathy. On admission, taking into account the mild presenting symptoms and the absence of respiratory involvement, Prednisone and Azathioprine dosages were increased (respectively from 7.5 to 12.5 and from 50 to 75 mg), withholding standard treatments for MG exacerbation, such as intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis.\\nIn the first days of hospitalization, the patient developed progressive worsening of ocular movement abnormalities with horizontal and vertical gaze limitation, mild fluctuating diplopia in primary and lateral gaze, nystagmus on left lateral gaze, limb ataxia, and wide-based gait with multi-directional sways during Romberg maneuver. Additional findings included partial ptosis of the left eye, hands tingling, mild proximal weakness in lower limb, dysarthria, and facial asymmetry; nausea and episodes of vomiting persisted. While ophthalmoparesis could be compatible with MG, other clinical features suggested a different etiology.\\nDespite the fact that one of the most common presentations of MG is represented by ocular symptoms, acute bilateral ophthalmoparesis can be also attributed to various etiologies (Table 1).\\nBlood tests were unremarkable, except for mild hypercholesterolemia and increase of inflammatory indexes (C-reactive protein 0.71 mg/dl:normal value <0.5 mg/dl; erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35:normal value <20). Thyroid function, serum folic acid, and vitamin B12 dosages were normal. Antibodies against AChR and GQ1b were dosed.\\nElectromyography, performed after 5 days from the symptom onset, revealed mildly increased latency of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the right facial nerve and moderate chronic neurogenic abnormalities in the muscles innervated by the right L5 and the right C5-C6 nerve roots; right tibial and right ulnar nerve F-wave latency was normal. Repetitive nerve stimulation did not show a decremental response.\\nBrain MRI revealed only mild chronic cerebrovascular disease and mild cortical and subcortical atrophy, without signs of acute cerebral lesions or Wernicke's encephalopathy (Figures 1A,B).\\nClinical symptoms worsened up to complete external ophthalmoplegia and inability to walk unsupported with almost complete disappearance of upper limb reflexes. Another electromyography was repeated 3 days later, displaying a predominantly sensory polyradiculoneuropathy, characterized by increased facial nerve latency and absence of sural, ulnar, and radial sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) (Figure 1C); ulnar nerve F-wave seemed not clearly detectable.\\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, including virological investigations, was performed 6 days after symptom onset and resulted unremarkable, without albuminocytological dissociation (cells <1/mmc, proteins 24 mg/dl). Serum and CSF oligoclonal banding were absent.\\nOncological screening, including neoplastic markers and full-body CT scan with contrast, performed due to the medical history of the subject, was negative for malignancies.\\nThe workup suggested a diagnosis of acute polyradiculoneuropathy; thus, the patient was treated with five sessions of plasmapheresis, leading to stabilization of the clinical features and subsequent slow mild clinical improvement, especially of limb ataxia and, at a lesser extent, of gait ataxia and diplopia. Nausea and episodes of vomiting decreased too.\\nAntibodies against ganglioside GQ1b turned out to be positive at high titer on serum (IgM 1/2560 and IgG 1/5120; cut-off <1/640), confirming the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS). Antibodies against AChR were positive but lower compared to the last known titer (36.3 pmol/ml   7.2 pmol/ml; normal values < 0.5 pmol/ml).\\nAt discharge, the patient still presented severe ophthalmoparesis (only minimal ocular movements were possible), exhaustible left palpebral ptosis, facial asymmetry, gait ataxia (need for external support, maintenance of Romberg with multi-directional swinging with closed eyes), and slight weakness in proximal lower limb muscles, and brachioradialis reflex reappeared, though greatly reduced.\\nThe patient underwent a cycle of physiotherapy and rehabilitation. After 2 months, without further therapy modifications, he was able to walk independently and the ophthalmoparesis markedly improved. Clinical evaluation showed mild convergence strabismus in primary position, mild limitation in horizontal and upward gaze, diplopia after 15 s on left lateral gaze, mild ptosis in the left eye after exercise, presence of the biceps and patellar reflexes, absence of limb or gait ataxia.

A 7-year retrospective review of RCC in our center between 2007 and 2014 during which a total of 51 cases of RCC were managed showed no case of BDC. Forty percent (40%) of BDC are known to present with metastatic disease with 66% succumbing to the disease within 2 years of presentation,.

Histopathologic evaluation of the resected kidney specimen revealed proliferation of malignant epithelial cells forming tubules which are cystically dilated. The renal stroma was desmoblastic and infiltrated by some of these malignant cells. Tumour was confined to the gerota's fascia. The findings were consistent with a tubulocystic variant of BDC. Evaluation of the iliac bone specimen was in keeping with a metastasis from BDC of the kidney. The patient made a smooth post-operative recovery and is being planned for commencement of immunotherapy with Sunitinib (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4).\",\n",

There was also discharge of pus over her right femoral dialysis catheter.\\nShe was diagnosed to have disseminated Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia secondary to infected right femoral non-tunnelled dialysis catheter. Her first nine blood cultures grew MSSA, so did her wound culture. Her femoral line was removed and she was treated in medical intensive care unit (MICU) for her septic shock. She was referred to the infectious diseases (ID) team and she received systemic vancomycin, clindamycin and then cloxacillin over the course of several weeks as culture results became known. The patient subsequently improved clinically with resolution of fever and improvement of haemodynamic parameters. Her inflammatory markers including procalcitonin and white blood cell count showed decreasing trends. Approximately six weeks after admission, there was documented clearance of MSSA from her blood. The plan by ID was to continue intravenous cloxacillin for a total of six weeks from her last negative blood culture for the presumed endovascular infection although she had a normal two dimensional echocardiograph.\\nUnfortunately her stay in hospital was delayed as she developed extensive right lower limb deep vein thrombosis, for which she was treated with heparin infusion, inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and subsequently warfarin. Approximately two months into her stay in hospital, she developed an episode of sepsis with desaturation, drop in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and low grade fever. Urgent neuroimaging revealed no intracranial infarct or hemorrhage. However her subsequent four blood cultures, taken two days apart, all grew Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, which was susceptible to cotrimoxazole, levofloxacin, and minocycline, but resistant to amikacin. She was treated with intravenous antibiotics, comprising courses of cotrimoxazole, cefazolin and meropenem, after consultation with the ID team. Three days after her first positive blood culture for Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, she developed a red and painful left eye with blurring of vision.\\nA referral to Ophthalmology was promptly made. On examination her right pupil was noted to be sluggish, and left pupil fixed. There was a reverse relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). Visual acuity in her right eye was 6/120 (without reading glasses) with no perception of light (NPL) in her left eye. Examination of her left eye showed an injected conjunctiva, hazy cornea with Descemet's membrane (DM) folds, and a deep anterior chamber filled with a hypopyon and fibrin. A glint of an intraocular lens could be seen. There was no view of the fundus but B-scan ultrasonography showed multiple vitreous opacities. The impression was that of left eye endogenous endophthalmitis, for which she underwent an intravitreal tap for vitreous culture, as well as injection of intravitreal vancomycin and amikacin. She was also started on hourly fortified gentamicin and cefazolin eyedrops. In view of the absence of perception of light, as well as her systemic status, vitrectomy was not resorted to. There was also no immediate indication for evisceration.\\nThe patient's vitreous cultures came back positive for Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and minocycline, but resistant to ceftazidine, gentamicin and amikacin. In consideration of the sensitivity results, the intravitreal antibiotics were switched to ciprofloxacin (100 micrograms/0.05 ml). The injection was repeated five times before it was felt that the infection was under reasonable control. The fibrin clot in her anterior chamber progressively resolved and the inflammatory material in the vitreous cavity became organised. The eye was quiet with no pain. While vision was not expected to recover, the need for evisceration was successfully averted.\\nPotential environmental source links were investigated. Workflows for ward staff were reviewed. Environmental screening was performed by swab cultures of surfaces and equipment within patient rooms, taps and aerators, water sampling and sampling of chlorhexidine solution. While no clear source of the bacteria was identified, it was presumably from aerators and hand hygiene sinks, as was found in a previous investigation of the same bacteria in the hospital.\",\n",

Family medical history includes maternal EDS. She has no history of smoking or alcohol use. \\nDue to the pathological progression of EDS, the patient underwent multiple orthopedic procedures for her hip, knee, shoulders, and ankles. After the procedures, she started having worsening symptoms such as increased joint pain and facial swelling. After looking through the patient's past medical and surgical history, her immunologist concluded that the aggravation of symptoms was strongly associated with medical implants placed during the procedures that triggered mast cells to initiate an immune response. The patient was advised to remove the foreign bodies which were implanted. This report highlights the removal of three Weck clips that were placed during her cholecystectomy. \\nOn the day of the operation, she was taken to the operating room, and prepped under general anesthesia. At this time, pneumoperitoneum was obtained periumbilically, and the abdomen was explored. Epigastric, midepigastric, and right mid quadrant ports were placed percutaneously under direct vision. During the procedure, fluoroscopy was utilized and there was no evidence of metal clips in the right upper quadrant. Next, the gallbladder fossa was examined where three separate Weck clips were found. Two clips were located on the cystic duct and one on the cystic artery. All clips were removed and sent to pathology (Figure 1). No bleeding or bile spill was encountered. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. A few hours after the procedure, the patient was discharged without any postoperative complications. After one week, the patient returned to the out-patient clinic for a follow-up and stated that she had felt great relief of her hypersensitivity reactions since the procedure.\",\n",

A 2013 angiography revealed a left occipital lobe AVM, fed by the calcarine and the posterior inferior temporal artery branches, with superficial venous drainage through the medial occipital vein into the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus, and deep drainage through the occipital vein into the vein of Galen, thus classifying it as a Spetzler-Martin grade III AVM [Figure 1].\\nThe patient underwent partial resection of the malformation in 2014. We complemented the treatment with embolization in August 2017, with the intraluminal permanence of the endovenous catheter evolving as a complication after gluing to the vein. We performed cervicotomy to remove the catheter but could not remove the intracranial part. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a brain abscess (2018) after a physical examination revealed purulent exudate through the cervical surgical wound. He presented neurologically with contralateral homonymous hemianopsia, without any other symptoms.\\nThe patient was admitted to our hospital in February 2019. He was reinvestigated using cerebral angiography, which demonstrated residual AVM with the embolization material and the presence of an endovenous catheter in the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus up to the right jugular vein [Figure 2]. He also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in May 2019 (T1-weighted with gadolinium and T2). We observed the presence of an intra-axial, rounded lesion, with well-defined edges, heterogeneous at the expense of a hyperintense halo with a hypointense center in T2, located in the convexity of the left pre-cuneus, surrounded by significant perilesional edema. The lesion showed significant ring enhancement with the passage of the contrast medium [Figure 3].\\nThereafter, he underwent microsurgery, with reopening of planes, complete resection of the AVM transulcal route, removal of residual granuloma.\\nThe catheter remained in the posterior third of the superior sagittal sinus extending up to the cervical region of the right jugular vein.

We started anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and performed a right cervicotomy. We opened the jugular vein to remove the catheter and subsequently ligated the vein [Figure 4].\\nThe patient is currently asymptomatic, without neurological deficits or new febrile episodes. Postoperative MRI scans of the brain showed expected changes without the presence of residual lesions, including edema in the surgical location. Cerebral angiography revealed the absence of residual AVMs [Figure 5].\\n[Table 1] lists the main variables that were analysed. There were seven cases of abscesses resulting from endovascular procedures for AVM [Table 1]. The symptoms for AVM diagnosis mainly were: headache, nausea, hemiparesis, and seizures.

The radiographic findings revealed well obturated canals with no periapical changes.\\nA conservative approach of restoring the tooth with an endocrown was decided as the treatment option, as more than half the residual tooth structure was remaining and there were no occlusal wear facets. On additional request by the patient for an advanced and a prompt restoration, CAD/CAM ceramic was chosen.\\nAfter removal of the provisional restoration, preparation for endocrown was initiated. Resin modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji II LC GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to achieve a flat pulpal floor and to block the undercuts. The preparation consisted of a circular equigingival butt-joint margin and central retention cavity into the entire pulp chamber constructing both the crown and the core as a single unit.

The patient was characterised by a high degree of body dissatisfaction, which had been present since childhood. As a consequence, the patient avoided scales as well as mirrors and public display. The patient reported she still had eating binges, but the frequency was low, with the most recent episode occurring three months prior to the psychosocial assessment interview. Within the past four years, she had not met the full diagnostic criteria for BED. Her existing eating binges were provoked when experiencing difficulty with emotion regulation, for example after a quarrel with her partner. Alongside the eating disorder symptoms, the patient suffered from depression. The symptoms were active at referral to BS but the patient was in treatment with antidepressants, which was described as helpful. Although the clinical impression was of depression in remission, the patient scored 36 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-ii), corresponding to severe depression. Family history revealed serious parental neglect, and childhood memories were considered \"painful\", and as roots to the depressive inclination. Binge eating was described as something that could provide a feeling of security and comfort in a world of pain and chaos. Her current life situation was assessed as stable: the patient lived with her partner, with whom she planned to raise a family.

He was moved to a COVID-19 isolation area, and during his hospital stay reported no fever, respiratory, or gastrointestinal symptoms. He subsequently presented two negative SARS-CoV-2 tests on June 29 and 30 (Aptima  SARS-CoV-2 assay, which uses target capture and transcription-mediated amplification), so he was considered cured from asymptomatic COVID-19. He was discharged on July 3 on prednisolone 80 mg/day. While at home (July 6), he had chest computed tomography (CT), which had been ordered to exclude signs of sarcoidosis as part of the secondary demyelinating disease workup and which revealed a peripheral ground-glass opacity compatible with early COVID-19 (Fig. 2).\\nOn July 9, he represented with fever, headache, myalgias, and cough, and on July 13, he was tested as an outpatient for SARS-CoV-2 with a positive result. His family (mother, father, and wife) also developed respiratory symptoms and all tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, they were shielding and reported no other risk contact besides the one with our patient.\\nOn July 15, he was admitted to our hospital, reporting worsening of the symptoms, with dyspnea and thoracalgia. On admission, he was tachypneic and presented with severe respiratory failure, rapidly requiring intubation and transfer to our intensive care unit (ICU). Chest CT showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacification and extensive subpleural consolidation of the lower lobes (Fig. 3), and SARS-CoV-2 swab was positive (Xpert  Xpress SARS-CoV-2: E Ct 15.9; N2 Ct 17.8; SPC Ct 0.0). Serologic tests were performed on July 16 (negative IgM and IgG) and on July 20 (positive IgG (8.00 UA/mL); positive IgA (9.18 ICO); negative IgM (4.5 UA/mL)). The patient clinically improved on methylprednisolone 80 mg/day (for 7 days followed by tapering), piperacillin/tazobactam, and remdesivir and was extubated after 7 days. At the time of the writing of this report, he has been discharged from the ICU and is progressing favorably in the COVID ward.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 24-year-old previously healthy woman fell from standing height directly on her left elbow and sustained an isolated comminuted olecranon fracture with axial impaction and depression of the articular joint surface (Figure 1(a)). The radial head was intact. She was treated in an outside hospital with a figure-of-eight tension band construct despite the presence of intraarticular comminution. Intraoperative views with an image intensifier reveal marginal reduction of the fragments and incongruency of the ulnohumeral joint (Figure 1(b)). She was immobilized in a cast for 10 days and was not allowed passive nor active range of motion exercises. Ten days after the injury the patient was evaluated for routine postoperative follow-up. Radiographic evaluation at that time revealed ulnar shortening and poor ulnohumeral congruency. After 13 weeks she underwent a second procedure for removal of prominent hardware.\\nFive months after the injury, the patient presented to the senior author with a poor functional result. She had 65 degrees of ulnohumeral motion with 90 degrees of flexion and a 25 flexion contracture with full forearm rotation. She had a stable elbow with pain in active and passive range of motion. Computed tomographic evaluation revealed depression of the articular surface of the trochlear notch and shortening of the proximal ulna. She had an incongruent ulnohumeral joint leading to impingement and loss of function. The articular surfaces of the radiocapitellar joint remained opposed (Figure 2). \\nAn osteotomy was planned to restore congruency of the trochlear notch to achieve a functional arc of motion. After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed in lateral decubitus and the left arm was placed over a bolster. A midline posterior incision was used to expose the proximal ulna. An osteotomy was performed at the level of the depressed articular surface to mobilize and elevate the depressed fragments in an attempt to realign the articular surfaces of the ulnohumeral joint. Reduction of the malunited intra-articular fragments was not possible because the fracture fragments were sclerotic. Shortening of the olecranon due to axial impaction:which was worsened by the tension-band construct:prohibited good alignment. An iliac-crest bone graft, 6 mm by 15 mm in size, was interposed to widen and reconstruct the trochlear notch. After lengthening of the proximal olecranon, the humerus could be easily reduced to restore ulnohumeral congruency. Stable fixation was achieved with 2 lag screws secured with a 4-hole LCP plate (Figure 3). It was noted that the posterior capsule was contracted. However, at this point it was chosen not to perform a posterior capsular release to preserve the surrounding soft tissues of the olecranon tip to protect vascular blood supply. Postoperatively, the patient was immobilized in a long arm cast and continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started. Careful active motion also began immediately under the supervision of a physical therapist.\\nOne year after the index surgery, the patient had a functional arc of motion. She had 95 degrees of ulnohumeral motion with 115 degrees of flexion and a flexion contracture of 20 degrees. Her elbow was rendered stable and she has no pain. Posterior contracture release was performed at this point combined with hardware removal. Postoperative radiographs suggested posterior impingement of the olecranon tip hindering extension. This was not found on Intraoperative passive range of motion.\\nTwo years after the index surgery, and one year after removal of hardware and contracture release, she had a functional elbow with 105 degrees of ulnohumeral motion (115 degrees of flexion and a 10-degree flexion contracture), 87 points according to American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon evaluation and 7 points on the Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand score (see Figure 4).',\n",

Five years after his initial ablation, the patient developed symptomatic palpitations due to atrial fibrillation and he was prescribed flecainide and metoprolol. Despite antiarrhythmic therapy, the patient continued to have symptomatic atrial fibrillation with palpitations but no shortness of breath. The patient was taken for AF ablation. The preablation echocardiogram demonstrated normal ventricular function and pulmonary pressures. The preprocedural computed tomography (CT) scan along with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was done on the procedural table prior to the transeptal puncture but did not pick up the pulmonary vein stenosis. Pulmonary vein potential mapping noted that there was a potential at the ostium of the left superior pulmonary vein. There was also difficulty advancing the catheter into the left superior pulmonary vein due to a possible obstruction. Direct angiography of the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) confirmed complete PV stenosis. The procedure was aborted in lieu of further diagnostic work up. A higher resolution cardiac CT angiogram (Figure 1(a)) and left atrium 3D reconstruction (Figure 1(b)) was used to confirm subtotal occlusion of the left superior pulmonary venous trunk. A lung perfusion scan revealed significantly decreased left upper lung perfusion (Figure 2) with the left lung contributing approximately 18% of the lung function and the right lung contributing 82% of the total lung function. A levophase angiogram of the right middle lobe pulmonary arterial system demonstrated venous return confined to the area of the lung supplied by the arterial vasculature. The levophase pulmonary angiogram demonstrated well developed collateral circulation from the left upper lobe to the mid segment of the left lung (Figures 3(a) and 3(b), resp.). After cardiac workup, it was concluded that this pulmonary vein stenosis is chronically totally occluded and less amenable to percutaneous intervention for reestablishment of flow. Ultimately, the decision to intervene to relieve the stenosis and to repeat AF ablation on the remaining pulmonary veins was left to the patient. The patient initially opted for continuance of antiarrhythmic drug therapy. However, due to persistence of breakthrough atrial fibrillation despite antiarrhythmic therapy, the patient ultimately underwent repeat atrial fibrillation ablation procedure two years after his initial presentation to our institution.',\n",

The clinical appearance of the intraoral ulcer was more typical of squamous cell carcinoma or a traumatic ulcer because of the lesion's presence on the line of occlusion (Figure 1). \\n Under local anesthesia, an elliptical incisional biopsy was taken from the lesion, which included part of the ulcer and normal mucosa. The biopsy specimen was fixed in 10% formalin for conventional histologic examination. Light microscopic examination of sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed hyperplastic squamous epithelium and suprabasal bullae with acantholytic cells.

During that year, she complained of a 60-pound weight gain, amenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, bruising, and diffuse striae. Physical examination demonstrated moon facies, \"buffalo hump,\" and diffuse striae (abdomen, hip, buttock, breast, and lower extremity), as well as acne, bruising, and significant hirsutism (Figs. 1A-C).\\nBiochemical evaluation revealed elevation of both cortisol (serum 26.0 microg/dL, normal range 5-23 microg/dL) and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) (32 pg/mL, normal range 5-27 pg/mL). Neither cortisol nor ACTH was suppressed by a high- or low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. MRI of the head with and without contrast (performed to evaluate for a potential pituitary adenoma, given the elevated ACTH) revealed a possible microadenoma, although this was felt to be an unlikely source of excess ACTH. Subsequently, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to search for an ectopic source of ACTH production. The CT revealed a 7x4cm, heterogeneous, lobulated, left adrenal mass. Portions of the mass showed poorly defined margins, raising suspicion for local invasion into the retroperitoneal fat (Figs. 2A-C). Contrast enhancement kinetics could not confirm an adrenal adenoma (relative percentage washout [RPW] of 24%), although this examination was not performed for dedicated adrenal mass evaluation (images were obtained at 75 seconds and 3 minutes per a standard abdominal CT protocol versus at 60 seconds and 15 minutes per a dedicated adrenal mass protocol).

The right adrenal gland was normal, and there was no imaging evidence for distant metastasis within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.\\nGiven the presence of an adrenal mass, additional biochemical evaluation was ordered; it revealed elevation of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) (697 ug/dL, normal range 145-395 ug/dL). Elevation of multiple adrenal products, especially the sex hormone precursors DHEA-S and testosterone, also raised suspicion for carcinoma. Metanephrines, prolactin, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were normal.\\nThe patient underwent open surgery with en bloc resection of the tumor. An elongated, lobulated, left adrenal mass weighing 136g was removed (Fig. 3). Afterward, the patient\\'s cortisol, DHEA, and ACTH levels returned to normal. Histopathological evaluation of the specimen demonstrated an adrenal neoplasm with two large nodular foci of extension into the surrounding fat. Grossly, the tumor was friable, beige-tan, with areas of pale yellow necrosis. On light microscopy, the vast majority of the tumor showed a lobular-to-solid growth pattern with deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 4a). A few vacuolated foci were present (Fig. 4b). The adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) showed extensive infiltration into the adjacent fat (Fig. 4c). Marked cytologic atypia was noted, with nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism. Lipofuchsin pigment, typical for hormonally active tumors, was easily discernible. Pathologically, a tumor is defined as ACC when three of the following histologic criteria are met: 1) high nuclear grade, 2) mitotic rate > 5 per 50 high-power fields, 3) atypical mitoses, 4) clear cells < 25%, 5) diffuse architectural pattern in more than one-third of the tumor, 6) confluent necrosis, 7) venous invasion, 8) sinusoidal invasion, and 9) capsular invasion. This tumor fulfilled five of the criteria. Curiously, despite the aggressive pattern of invasion, mitotic figures were less than 5/50 hpf, and no atypical mitoses were noted.\\nThe invasion into surrounding tissue, in addition to the size of the tumor, indicated a stage III ACC. After surgery, the patient underwent 45 days of adjuvant external-beam radiation. The etiology of the elevated ACTH levels in the setting of ACC remains unclear. Furthermore, the tumor did not stain for ACTH (Fig. 5).\\nOne year following surgery, the patient has returned to her baseline weight with near-complete resolution of her Cushingoid habitus and hirsutism, and a return of menstruation. Followup abdominal and pelvic CT 11 months after surgery revealed no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis.',\n",

After 6 months of trauma, patient noticed an extra oral swelling over anterior mandible with pus discharge intraorally. After 1 year of time, patient noticed loosening of mandibular anterior teeth. Patient again went to a private clinician where she was again conservatively managed with medication. Since past 2 years pus used to appear intermittently from same place, which used to stop on use of antibiotics. But since last 6 months, there is gradual increase in swelling of anterior mandible for which patient reported to OMFS department where patient was examined, evaluated and incisional biopsy of lesion was done which was suggestive of ameloblastoma. Then patient was admitted to OMFS ward for further management.\\nExtra-oral inspection showed a large swelling in anterior region of mandible over chin area crossing midline, measuring approximately 8 x 7 cm in size. Face was asymmetrical, deviated towards left. Scar mark was present over right side of chin. Color of the overlying skin was normal. On palpation, the swelling was bony hard. It was non-compressible, non-fluctuant, and slightly tender. Temperature of overlying skin was normal. Swelling extends to involve bilateral body of mandible [Figure 1].\\nIntra-oral inspection showed a large swelling seen involving buccal vestibule, floor of the mouth, and lower alveolus region. Mouth opening was adequate. On palpation, intraoral swelling was hard and mild tender. Sinus opening with respect to lower right and left canine (may be socket of teeth). There was bleeding from lower left canine region on palpation [Figure 2].\\nIncisional biopsy revealed epithelial islands admixed with fibrocollagenous tissue. Outermost layer of epithelial island was composed of tall columnar cells with polarization of the nuclei away from the basement membrane. The central portion of the island was composed of loose network of cells showing squamous metaplasia [Figure 3].\\nOrthopantomogram (OPG) of mandible showed multilocular expansile lytic lesion involving the symphysis and bilateral body of mandible. All mandibular teeth were lost except one molar tooth on either side [Figure 4].\\nComputed tomography (CT) scan revealed: Plain and contrast axial and coronal CT scans of face region revealed large multiloculated cystic expansile lesions arising from symphysis menti and bilateral body of mandible, and extending up to bilateral angle of mandible. Margins of the lesions were sclerotic and scalloped. Overlying all mandibular teeth was lost except one molar tooth on either side. Bilateral masseter muscles and tongue was normal in CT attenuation and dimensions. No obvious cervical lymphadenopathy [Figures 5 and 6].\\nOn the basis of above findings, resection of mandible and reconstruction with reconstruction plate was planned, under general anesthesia. The mandible was resected bilaterally at the body. The specimen was taken out and the defect was reconstructed using reconstruction plate. The genioglosus and the geniohyoid muscles were tied to the reconstruction plate and the incision was closed [Figures 7-9].\\nHistopathological findings of excised specimen confirmed the diagnosis of ameloblastoma.',\n",

The surgery revealed an inflammatory aortic aneurysm with clearly visible local wall necrosis (Picture 3). After clamping the aorta, the aneurysm sac was incised, releasing a great volume of thrombosed and liquefied clots under significant pressure. The aorta and both iliac common arteries were sutured, and no bypass was performed. The postoperative course was unremarkable, and the patient was sent home on the sixth postoperative day.

Prior to these symptoms, the patient was Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group functional status (ECOG) of 2. Upon admission to the hospital, he was found to have a large nasal mass, palpable large left cervical lymphadenopathy. Timeline of events is outlined in Table 1.\\nCT imaging demonstrated a large infiltrative enhancing mass centered in the left side of the nasal cavity and left maxillary sinus as well as an enlarged left submandibular lymph node. Left submandibular lymph node fine-needle biopsy demonstrated sheets of lymphocytes with effacement of the normal lymph node architecture, with medium to large lymphocytes with nucleoli and vesicular chromatin. By immunohistochemistry, the atypical cells were Pax-5, CD20, MUM1, BCL2, and BCL6 positive and CD56, TdT, CD10, and cyclin D1 negative, with a Ki-67 of about 95%, consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NGCB type (Figure 1). PET/CT was performed after the biopsy to complete staging, which demonstrated multifocal hypermetabolic tumor foci including bilateral nasopharynx, bilateral nasal cavity, left maxillary sinus with extension to the left parapharyngeal space, soft palate, lingual tonsil, palatine tonsil, left face, bilateral neck nodes including jugulodigastric, posterior cervical, and the largest of which was a left submandibular node with central necrosis of 4 centimeters (Figure 2(a)). In addition, the liver and bone were diffusely increased in avidity suggestive of involvement by lymphoma (Figure 2(b)). The initial standardized uptake value (SUV) of the left submandibular node was 6.4, the liver was 3.2 SUV, and the bone marrow was 3.7 SUV. The patient and his sister refused biopsy of these sites to confirm the presence of disease pathologically. Based on these findings and a normal initial LDH level of 159 units per liter, he was considered stage IV, with International Prognostic Index (IPI) of 4 (high risk), as well as high risk for CNS involvement. After discussion with the patient and his sister, decision was made to pursue only \"nonchemotherapy\" treatments. As such, monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies, and corticosteroids were all considered; however, intrathecal chemotherapy was declined.\\nThe patient started treatment with ibrutinib, and the dose was escalated over several weeks to 420 mg daily by mouth. At the same time, 21-day cycles of rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1 along with prednisone 1 mg/kg PO for days 1 through 5 were also initiated. Supportive care was initiated simultaneously with allopurinol for tumor lysis prophylaxis. In addition, since the patient was wheelchair bound and at risk for thromboembolism, he was started on prophylactic dose of enoxaparin at 40 mg subcutaneously daily. Baseline hepatitis B, C, and HIV testing was negative. The patient tolerated the treatment well with no hematologic toxicities, minimal tumor lysis, no effect on renal or liver function, and no significant infection. The patient had an excellent response to treatment, and after the first cycle of chemotherapy, his epistaxis had resolved and his pain and swelling had also subsided. After five cycles of treatment, the patient had repeat PET/CT imaging that demonstrated near-complete response (Figure 2(a)). The dominant submandibular lymph node decreased in size from more than 4 cm to less than 1.5 cm, there were only residual erosive changes in the maxilla with mild residual FDG avidity (SUV max 3.6), the FDG activity in the liver resolved to SUV 2.7, and however the bone marrow remained PET avid with SUV 3.8. After 4 additional cycles, the patient achieved a complete response on repeat PET imaging including resolution of the bone marrow avidity (Figure 2(a)). This response was durable, and even after cessation of therapy, he had no signs of recurrence.\\nAfter a total of 9 cycles of rituximab, prednisone, and ibrutinib, the patient had a complete response (Figure 2). At that time, however, ECG demonstrated that he was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was referred to cardiology, and his dose of enoxaparin was increased to a therapeutic level at 1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice per day. He was started on beta blockade with control of his heart rate. At that point, the plan was to transition to rituximab maintenance every 2 months. Ibrutinib was continued as his atrial fibrillation seemed to be rate controlled. Repeat PET/CT showed the disease was still in remission one month later; however, prior to his first dose of maintenance rituximab, he presented to an outside hospital with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was diagnosed simultaneously with sepsis from pneumonia and respiratory failure from both pneumonia and an acute exacerbation of heart failure. During the hospital course, the patient and his sister decided to stop all interventions and he was made comfort care. He died a few weeks later on hospice care. Despite being off of treatment for several weeks, however, there was no sign of recurrent disease at that time.',\n",

Immunohistochemistry of pleural tissue showed that majority of tumour cells were positive for synaptophysin and a few cells were positive for Ki-67 (2%) and negative for pan-cytokeratin, calretinin, Wilm's tumour protein 1 (WT1), desmin, vimentin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), and CD 56 (Figure 4). Hence, tissue diagnosis was well-differentiated malignant neuroendocrine tumour of pleura. Histopathology and IHC findings were reviewed by another pathologist of different centre, and the diagnosis was confirmed. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was normal. CECT of abdomen and brain revealed no abnormality. No abnormality was detected on endoscopic examination of upper gastrointestinal tract and on colonoscopy. Radionuclide bone scan did not show any metastatic deposit in bones. So, final diagnosis was primary, well-differentiated, malignant neuroendocrine tumour of pleura, presenting as isolated right-sided pleural effusion.\\nSix cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy comprising of intravenous infusion of carboplatin (at an area under the concentration-time curve 6.0 on day 1, 450 mg in this case) and etoposide (100 mg/m2/day, 130 mg in this case on days 1, 2, and 3) were given. Along with chemotherapy, intercostal tube drainage under water seal was given in right hemithorax through fifth intercostal space at right midaxillary line, as recurrent and rapid collection of massive amount of pleural fluid occurred and repeated aspiration of pleural fluid failed to reduce the volume of pleural fluid. When there was clinicoradiological evidence of complete expansion of right lung parenchyma, chemical pleurodesis with 20 mL of 10% povidone-iodine was done. On one-year follow-up, progressive regression of pleural effusion with alleviation of chest pain was documented.\",\n",

Conventional brain MRI scans included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MRI data was processed to obtain tractography and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps using GE FuncTools software. MR images were examined for extent and location of tumor as well as invasion, destruction, or displacement of brain parenchyma and white-matter tracts. A 4.0 x 3.9-cm solid cystic lesion with lobulated margins in the cerebellar vermis was observed on T2-weighted MRI (Figs. 1A, 1B), which had increased in size from prior studies. There was also herniation of the vermis with effacement of the quadrigeminal plate cistern, mild herniation of cerebellar tonsils below the level of foramen magnum, and partial obstruction of CSF outflow at the level of the 4th ventricle. Tractography (Figs. 2A, 2B) and FA maps (Fig. 3) suggested on the basis of imaging that fiber tracts surrounding the lesion were displaced, but fiber integrity (as represented by fractional anisotropy) was maintained. This suggested a less aggressive type of neoplastic lesion.\\nThe patient underwent tumor-debulking surgery via a suboccipital craniotomy, with good outcome. The histopathology showed a largely circumscribed astrocytoma with associated macrocysts, microcalcifications, eosinophilic granular bodies, and rare Rosenthal fibers, consistent with a benign entity such as a pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) (Fig. 4). However, focally localized atypical features were also present, including a hypercellular focus with increased mitotic activity and pseudopalisading necrosis, and vascular proliferation, consistent with PA with anaplastic features (Fig. 5). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated GFAP positivity, p53 negativity, and focally positive MIB1 labeling. In light of this patient's longstanding history of a midline cerebellar mass, it is likely that this mass may have been a stable nonanaplastic PA that eventually developed anaplastic features around the time of symptom progression.\\nA followup MRI performed three months after resection demonstrated expected postoperative changes without evidence to suggest recurrence.\",\n",

She had never experienced neurological symptoms before.\\nShe drove to an emergency department where mild weakness of the right arm was found, and she was immediately referred to the stroke department. An MRI scan revealed no acute ischemia on the diffusion-weighted scan, but on T2*-weighted imaging, a dark focus of increased susceptibility ('microbleed') was visible in the left pons, in the area of her described symptoms (fig. 1). The symptoms fit well with the location because of the proximity to the corticospinal tract (lesion of which causes contralateral weakness) and the medial longitudinal fasciculus (lesion of which causes double vision due to internuclear ophthalmoplegia.) Dizziness is a rather unspecific symptom but often seen with lesions in the vertebrobasilar circulation. On the B-zero diffusion series, the microbleed revealed a rim of T2 hyperintensity consistent with edema and an acute timing of the lesion (fig. 2).\\nOn the following day, the patient complained of subjective dizziness, but the neurological exam was normal. She was referred to the nephrology service for better antihypertensive control and was subsequently discharged.\\nTransient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a focal neurological deficit that normalizes within 24 h and is attributable to ischemia. Microbleeds have been associated with transient deficits, but only in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

Past medical history included psoriasis, diagnosed 4 years prior. His only HIV exposure was perinatal. On exam the patient weighed 22 kilograms, and vitals signs were within normal limits. He was alert and oriented with a normal level of consciousness and responded appropriately to questions. His speech was slowed and slurred, but this was his baseline according to his mother. He had right-sided facial palsy and right-sided tongue deviation; otherwise cranial nerves were intact. The boy had 3/5 strength in the right upper extremity and 4/5 strength in the right lower extremity. Left-sided strength was 5/5. The patient was able to walk with limited difficulty. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and 3+ throughout. Babinski's sign showed dorsiflexion of the right 1st toe. Sensation was intact throughout. The patient also had clusters of 1-2 mm skin colored papules on his forehead and left cheek in addition to diffuse mild psoriatic scaling. Immunizations were up to date.

CT (Figure 1) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Figure 2) scans were subsequently performed. The scans showed progressive of white matter lesions with asymmetrical deep and subcortical white matter lesions over the left frontotemporoparietal region and the right frontal lobe. The lesion on the left hemisphere involved internal capsule, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, and genu of corpus callosum and anterior cerebellar hemisphere.

Physical examination showed global hypotonia, developmental delay, and no dysmorphisms. She was the first child of healthy consanguineous parents, without pathological familiar history. Delivery was preterm via caesarean section because of foetal distress. Her weight was 1.720 kg, height of 41.5 cm, and an occipitofrontal circumference of 29 cm. The Apgar scores immediately after delivery and at 5 minutes were 3 and 8, so she was given neonatal resuscitation. She was observed in the neonatal care unit for the first three months of life because of respiratory distress episodes. Chromosome analysis showed a normal karyotype, abdominal and ophtamological exams were unremarkable. The patient was then referred to the paediatric unit after the respiratory distress episodes were treated. Her developmental milestones were incompletely informed: social smile and holding head at 3 months, sitting without support at 10 months, crawling at 11 months, and standing up with support and first words at 12 months of age. After the first year of life, the patient presented with failure to thrive and neurological regression was reported as she stopped grabbing toys and pointing objects and persons. At 2 years of age, she started episodes of diarrhoea and sleepiness evolving with respiratory failure at home and was taken to the emergency room for support and management. Her respiratory failure could not be resolved, so she was referred to the paediatric intensive care unit for better support. Her laboratory findings showed consecutive high levels of serum lactate (21 mg/dL when admitted to our critical time intervention programme, 19 mg/dL at day 7, 54 mg/dL at day 14, 69 mg/dL at day 19, and 30 mg/dL at day 24 after admission; the reference lactic acid level is 4.5 - 14.4 mg/dL). Metabolic investigations included tandem mass and urinary organic acid analyses, which were normal. Ophthalmological examination showed optic atrophy and echocardiography, abdominal and doppler sonography were normal. The electroencephalography suggested parieto-occipital epileptiform discharges, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral high intensity T2/Flair foci in the periventricular and peritrigonal white matter, internal capsule of the posterior limb and thalamus periphery; additionally, hyperintensities were observed in the cerebral peduncle, midbrain tegmentum, dorsal pons, and medulla oblongata, with a few areas of restricted diffusion, which is typical for mitochondrial disorders (Figure 1).\\nEmpirical mitochondrial vitamin cocktail therapy, including thiamine, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, biotin and L-carnitine, was initiated without clinically detectable improvement. Her treatment outcome was poor, with oxygen dependence, spastic tetraplegy, and severe developmental delay.\\nClinical exome sequencing was then performed. Informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents, according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and was quantified by using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit for the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). We used the TruSighta One Sequencing Panel (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for paired-end sequencing with a v3 600 cycles kit on a MiSeq System platform (Illumina), according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The FASTQ files were aligned to the Human Genome Reference Consortium build 37 (hg19) by using the Burroughs Wheeler Alignment algorithm as implemented in the BWA software package. After genome alignment, Variant Calling was performed by using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). Variants were annotated by using ANNOVAR, and selected read alignments were visualised by using the Integrative Genomics Viewer. All regions with a sequencing depth < 20 were considered unsuitable for analysis. Furthermore, we established a minimum threshold Phred-like quality score of 30 (base call accuracy of 99.9%). Common variants (3 1% in the general population) were discarded by comparison with the 1000 Genomes, the Exome Variant Server, and the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. Synonymous variants were filtered and only exonic and splice site variants were prioritized. Initially, we evaluated the variants in the homozygous state, because the parents of the proband were consanguineous, and prioritized genes based on phenotypic databases, such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. The variant identified as pathogenic was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\\nWe identified a novel homozygous 14 bp frameshift deletion in exon 2 of the C12orf65 gene: c.207_220del; p.Pro70Asnfs*28 (NM_152269), which was validated by Sanger sequencing, the sequence, being aligned with CRISP-ID (). This variant is not present in population control databases (Exome Aggregation Consortium, 1000 genomes and Exome Variant Server). The truncated protein is predicted to have 96 aa as opposed to the original length of 166 aa, lacking the GCQ domain (residues 57-121) and the coiled-coil region (residues 127-160) (UniProt databank); this likely results in loss of function. Based on these features and according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, this variant is considered to be pathogenic.\\nTo our knowledge, 27 patients were described with pathogenic variants in the C12orf65 gene with different clinical diagnoses (). The phenotype can vary from spastic paraparesis - type 55 - to Leigh syndrome. It has been thought that the main clinical features caused by C12orf65 variants correspond to a triad of optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis, associated or not with Leigh syndrome. The information available from 27 patients showed that 92.3% presented with optic atrophy, 80% with peripheral neuropathy, 60% with spasticity, 52.1% with cognitive impairment, 42.8% with nystagmus, 38.4% with ophthalmoplegia, and 20% with bulbar disfunction. Our patient had optic atrophy, bulbar dysfunction (manifested as dysphagia and respiratory failure), and neurodevelopmental delay. We could not evaluate nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia, and spasticity was not present at the time of examination; the MRI findings were typical for Leigh syndrome. Our patient could be included in the COXPD7 severe phenotype, as she had a dramatically deteriorating course as described by. This phenotype consists of significant cognitive and motor impairment and results in wheelchair dependence and typically abnormal Leigh syndrome brain MRI. Moreover, our patient showed a more severe phenotype when compared to patients described previously. The severity of this phenotype can be explained by the variant found, which affects an important functional protein domain (Figure 2).\\nRegarding the molecular status, the 27 described patients had 11 different pathogenic variants in the C12orf65 gene (). These variants were predominantly nonsense, splicing site and frameshift, and considered to be null variants. Only one of them, c.282G > A (p.Lys94Lys), was synonymous, but it was predicted to create a loss of splicing site with retention of intron 2, thus acting as a frameshift variant. The variant found in our patient was also a null variant, and we suggest that truncated C12orf65 proteins were generated after the deletion of 14 base pairs, which reinforces the idea that a loss-of-function mechanism is a fundamental part of the pathogenesis.\\nWe classified the phenotype of the reviewed patients as severe when there was bulbar dysfunction, or typical MRI findings of Leigh syndrome, or intellectual disability/neurodevelopmental delay, or absence of ambulation. The variants linked to severe phenotypes were more likely to affect the GCQ domain of the protein, although they could impact other protein domains (Figure 2).\\nThe reviewing of clinical features and variants of 27 already described patients and the patient herein shows that the phenotype associated with C12orf65 variants is heterogeneous and that variants impacting the GGQ protein domain tend to be associated with more severe phenotypes. This is in agreement with, who concluded that a clear genotype-phenotype correlation is anticipated, with deleterious mutations that disrupt the GGQ-containing domain being expected to result in a more severe phenotype, whereas downstream C-terminal alterations might result in a more favourable phenotype, typically lacking cognitive impairment.\\nOur review also showed that the median age for the onset of symptoms was 4 years and the median age for diagnosis was 17 years, so there was a 13-year diagnostic delay. Our patient presented the first symptoms immediately after birth, and the diagnosis was made two years later. A diagnostic delay may occur because of a variable phenotypic expression, despite the same aetiology (pathogenic variants in the C12orf65 gene), the rarity of the disease, the lack of knowledge about its existence and because of difficult access to molecular confirmation. Compared with literature data, our diagnostic delay was shorter, probably due to our patient having classical MRI signals of Leigh syndrome and elevated serum biomarkers (e.g., lactate), as well as a severe phenotype that contributed to active search for the aetiology. The prompt access to exome sequencing allowed a molecular diagnosis of the disorder.\\nIn conclusion, the present study allowed the identification of a C12orf65 gene variant associated with a severe phenotype of Leigh syndrome caused by COXPD7 and reinforces the importance of the GGQ protein domain for the conserved peptidyl-hydrolase function. Furthermore, this study highlights that the mechanism of loss of function has an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Additional reports could help to better understand genotype-phenotype correlations.\",\n",

Just after her OPU cycle, she used probiotic tampons during her menstruation. Sixty-four days after the initiation of Lf and 16 days from the usage of probiotic tampons (104 days from her first endometrial microbial analysis), a third endometrial microbial analysis was performed, finally resulting in LDM (Figure 2B, D-2). She had a successful ongoing pregnancy in her next FBT (Figure 7). We recommended that she continue LF through her pregnancy.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 5-year-old male patient was admitted to the National Children's Hospital with the complaint of abdominal pain and distention. Approximately 3 years ago, he presented with unexplained abdominal distention and intermittent abdominal pain accompanied by a sign of bowel loops floating in pain without vomiting. He had alternating episodes of constipation and diarrhea. He has been diagnosed with many different diseases such as prolonged digestive disorder, colitis, or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction in several hospitals. Last year, he underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy with images of total colitis, congestive gastritis with H. Pylori positive, and pyloric regurgitation. The patient then was taken internal medicine with inconsiderable improvement in symptoms. This time, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of more severe abdominal pain and distention. A clinical examination showed his height to be 116 cm (+1SD), and weight 17 kg (-1SD). There was a cafe au lait spot found on the neck, about 2 x 1.8 cm in size. The abdomen was much distended with the sign of bowel loops floating, no response of the abdominal wall, and no peritoneal reaction. On anorectal examination, the rectal balloon was empty.\\nHis abdominal X-ray image showed a lot of air-fluid levels, >2.5 cm in width [Figure 1]. On the abdominal ultrasound, the bowel was dilated and distended with air. On the enhanced CT images, there were diffuse lesions of small bowel mesentery and transverse mesocolon, encasing the mesenteric vessels without invasion or causing vessel stenosis/obstruction [Figure 2]. In addition, there were similar lesions surrounding the rectum. The lesions decreased in density on noncontrast CT images (~25HU), and slightly enhanced on portal venous phase CT images (~40HU). The small bowel loops were dilated with the largest transverse diameter of 45 mm. Some loops had wall thickening about 11 mm. There was free abdominal fluid accumulating predominantly in the pelvis cavity.\\nThe stool test showed pH = 7 and did not contain blood, mucus, pus, undigested meat fibers, and fungi. The blood test including complete blood count, coagulation tests, and blood chemistry tests (liver and kidney function tests, pancreatic enzymes) were normal.\\nThe patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative observation showed that the bowel loops were dilated about 4 cm in diameter, and the colon was soft in palpation without dilation. The entire small bowel mesentery and the right haft of the transverse mesocolon were thickened with yellow nodular cord-like structures along the vessels [Figure 3].\\nThe patient performed biopsies on the lesions of the mesentery and four bowel segments including dilated ileum, collapsed ileum, ascending colon, and transverse colon. The H&E staining specimens on the mesenteric lesions showed tumor tissue structure consisting of clusters of long slender spindle cells with wavy cytoplasm and slightly mucoid basal substances. There was blood vessel proliferation, interspersed with adipose tissue. No evidence of malignant transformation was seen. The immunohistochemical staining results showed S100 (++), SOX10 (-), CD117 (-) [Figure 4]. The final pathologic diagnosis was benign neurofibromatosis. On the specimens of dilated ileum, collapsed ileum, and ascending colon, no enteric ganglia were seen. On the specimens of the transverse colon, there were muscle tissue, enteric nerve plexus, and ganglion cells. Calretininx4 immunohistochemical staining result showed a loss of calretinin expression that indicated a decrease and loss of intestinal muscle function. The Synaptophysin stain result was positive. The pathologic diagnosis was enteric neuromuscular dysfunction.\\nWhen performing exploratory laparotomy, the surgeon found that the lesions were diffuse, encased in superior and inferior mesenteric vessels, and unable to completely resect. In addition, the pathologic result was benign. Therefore, the patient was treated with conservative therapy to relieve the symptoms and careful observation to detect malignant transformation early.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 59-year-old female patient with a 17-year history of DM was transferred to our Diabetic Foot Center due to a non-healing heel ulcer after 2 months of scalding. In the early stage of the disease, a large blister burst with much light-yellow exudation on the skin of the lesion site. Further, the amount of exudate decreased gradually, and the ulcer became black and failed to heal even with some conventional treatments such as dressing change and using antibiotics prescribed by another hospital.\\nOn both of her feet, the skin temperature was low, and the pulse of the dorsalis pedis artery and posterior tibial artery could not be palpated. There was a large, round ulcer of approximately 5 cm x 5 cm in diameter and unclear in depth. Its surface was covered with large black scabs with a little yellowish exudation visible around it. The tissue around it was cool, dark red, and swollen (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests showed her peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) was 9.1 * 109/L, of which neutrophils accounted for 79.9% and lymphocytes for 12.2%. Meanwhile, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 79 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 12 mg/dl, and procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.41 ng/ml. MRI of the diseased foot revealed local osteomyelitis on the calcaneal surface. B-scan ultrasound of her lower limb vessels showed diffuse moderate-to-severe stenosis in the middle and lower segments of the bilateral femoral artery. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination further indicated mild-to-severe stenosis in multiple segments of her bilateral femoral and popliteal arteries, as well as complete occlusion of her right femoral artery and posterior tibial artery (Figure 1B).\\nThere are more than 10 classification methods for diabetic foot, such as Meggitt-Wagner, Texas, PEDIS, SINBAD, and WIfI. The contents and indications of these classification methods are different, and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. Among them, the WIfI classification has been proposed for the threatened lower limb, based on the three main factors that have an impact on limb amputation risk: wound (W), ischemia (I), and foot infection (\"fI\"). This classification is commonly used in patients with ischemic diabetic foot, with the advantage of clear evaluation indicators that can help guide the diagnosis and treatment of DFUs, but with the disadvantage of lacking evaluation of diabetic neuropathy. The patient in this case report was evaluated and diagnosed using the WIfI classification. The person in this case report was found to have a large ulcer on the heel with approximately 25 cm2 in area, accompanied by severe limb ischemia and heel osteomyelitis by MRI but no systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Therefore, the DFUs of this patient were rated as diabetic foot W3 I3 fI2.\\nFirst, the surgery of balloon dilation under local anesthesia was planned for this patient to revascularize her right superficial femoral artery and peroneal artery. Preoperative angiography confirmed long segment occlusion of the inferior segment of her right superficial femoral artery with segmentary severe stenosis (Figure 1B). Intraoperatively, the superficial femoral artery, popliteal artery, anterior tibial artery, and peroneal artery were successfully revascularized, but the posterior tibial artery was not successfully re-opened. Postoperative angiography showed that the vascular lumen of the superficial femoral artery, popliteal artery, anterior tibial artery, peroneal artery, and some arterial arches of the foot were unobstructed in the affected limb (Figure 1C). Subsequently, the patient was then allowed several weeks for the recovery of local blood supply to the wound, while the wound was periodically debrided and dressed in a small range. In the fourth week after surgery, the peroneal perforator flap was transferred and repaired under general anesthesia. Postoperative nursing was also very important. For postoperative nursing, we took the following measures: psychological counseling, keeping the non-weight-bearing state of the limb, keeping the limb warm, raising the limb, and closely observing the blood transport and the color change of the flap. In the 7th week, stitches were removed, and the flap was alive (Figure 2G). At the 12th week, the affected limb could be loaded with moderate weight bearing. In the 24th week, the patient was able to walk freely with this limb in which the flap appearance and texture were perfect.',\n",

Associated findings included mild polyhydromnios and vertical lie. Guarded prognosis with conservative management till the birth of the fetus was advised. Mode of the delivery was to be decided by obstetric indications. Finally, the baby was born by cesarean section and had huge cervical mass. Baby cried immediately after birth and had respiratory distress of mild nature apparent only in supine position when the compression effect was maximum. The distress was relieved in lateral position, and baby was maintaining saturation with minimal oxygen support.\\nOn initial assessment, the vitals of the baby were stable. Examination of respiratory system revealed equal air entry on both the side with mild conducted sounds and inspiratory stridor. Rests of the systemic examinations were within normal limits. On local examination, there was a neck mass which was solitary, oval, of size about 9 x 5 x 6 cms in midline anteriorly having firm consistency with moderate mobility in all the directions [Figure 2]. Swelling was non-pulsatile, and there were no skin changes.\\nInitial imaging was done by X-ray neck and ultrasound. These were stipulated calcifications within the mass as shown by X-ray. Ultrasound showed the mass to be consisting of solid matrix with occasional cystic areas filled with hemorrhagic fluid having freckles of calcifications and well-defined capsules all around with neck vessels pushed laterally and some degree of tracheal displacement suggestive of the teratoma with mass effect. Computed tomographic scan was obtained to further rule out the organ of origin, vascular involvement, and thoracic extension of the mass lesion. CT showed the mass to be of size 8 x 6 x 5 cms and heterogeneous with scattered, nodular calcification extending superiorly into sub-mandibular and inferiorly up to supraclavicular region [Figure 3]. Invasive investigations like fine needle biopsy were not attempted due to the fear of hemorrhage within the tumor leading to further aggravation of respiratory distress and complicating the pre-operative clinical scenario. Corroborative evidences of the mass to be teratoma were obtained by means of tumor marker studies like estimation of alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropins. Alpha-fetoprotein level was significantly high in the range of 83,000 ng/ml though there was no rise in beta HCG. As the neck teratomas mostly arise from and completely replace the thyroid tissue, thyroid function test was also obtained, but T3, T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal range.\\nAfter pre-operative stabilization and investigations, patient was taken up for the surgical excision of the mass. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was done though securing the airway was difficult. Transverse incision directly over the mass was given. Below the platysma muscles, the well-encapsulated mass was lying above the strap muscles of the neck, attached only with the fibrous bands and few small caliber vessels feeding the mass. Complete enucleation of the mass without capsule rupture was attained, and specimen was sent for histopathological examinations. No ventilatory support was needed in post-operative period. Feeds were allowed in 2nd post-operative day, and patient was discharged on 4th day. Repeat alpha-fetoprotein and beta HCG at the end of 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year were within normal range.\\nHistopathology report came out as lobulated grey-white mass predominantly solid with areas of cystic changes. Cysts were ranging from 1 mm to 1 cm and filled with mucinous material. The solid parts consisted of cartilages and bony spicules. Multiple sections studied from tumor showed mature as well as immature elements derived from all 3 germ layers. Mature elements comprised of nests of squamous cells, glands, mature cartilage, occasional bony tissue, neural tissue, and smooth muscle tissue. Immature elements included neuroepithelial elements, occasional group of blastemal cells, and immature cartilage in myxoid stroma. Mitosis was in the range of 2/10 HPF.

The patient had experienced transient left-sided hemiparesis when he was 11-years-old, and he was eventually diagnosed with MMD at 12 years of age. He was prescribed aspirin at a previous hospital. Sixteen years had passed uneventfully; however, at 28 years of age, he presented with a sudden headache. Computed tomography revealed right thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular hemorrhage [Figures 1a and b]. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed MMD (Suzuki grade 4) development of the thalamic channel with hemorrhage in the ipsilateral hemisphere [Figures 1c-f]. We performed superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass and encephalo-duromyo-arterio-pericranial synangiosis (EDMAPS) in the right hemisphere for the prevention of rebleeding. The postoperative course was uneventful. After 3 months, STA-MCA bypass and EDMAPS were performed in the left hemisphere. DSA performed 3 months after the last surgery showed patency of the direct bypass and development of transdural anastomosis due to the indirect bypass. In addition, a pseudoaneurysm was observed in the right posterior branch of the MMA [Figures 2a and b]. The pseudoaneurysm was located immediately under the edge of the craniotomy site [Figure 2c].\\nFigure 2d demonstrated the intraoperative photo of STAMCA bypass and EDMAPS on ipsilateral hemisphere of pseudoaneurysm development. The arrow showed the location of pseudoaneurysm hereafter. The damage to MMA by craniotomy or dura cut may be a cause of aneurysm development.\\nWe planned to perform the internal trapping under general anesthesia. After intravenous administration of 4000 U of heparin, the right external carotid artery was catheterized with a 4-Fr guiding sheath (ASAHI FUZBUKI, Asahi Intech, Japan). Subsequently, a distal access catheter (Guidepost, Tokai Medical Products, Japan) and microcatheter (Echelon-10, Medtronic, USA) were navigated into the right MMA. Microangiography of the posterior trunk of MMA revealed transdural anastomosis by indirect bypass [Figure 3a]. The aneurysm size was 4.2 mm x 3.9 mm and neck length was 1.1 mm [Figure 3b]. Fortunately, aneurysm neck was small against our expectations; as a result, we could embolized aneurysm tightly without MMA occlusion.\\nThe microcatheter was navigated into the pseudoaneurysm, and the pseudoaneurysm was embolized using five platinum coils (Optima Coil System , BALT, USA) [Figure 3c]. Angiography after embolization showed complete occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm, patency of the MMA, and transdural anastomosis [Figure 3d].

       "    'case_text': 'An 80-year-old, right-handed woman was referred to our hospital for a 3 year history of moderate amnesia and progressive difficulties in finding words and understanding conversations. She was a college graduate and had worked as a nurse until her mid-50 s. She was healthy except for bladder cancer surgery at the age of 60. At age 77, she demonstrated difficulty in finding words and diminished ability to recognize spoken words, which progressed in subsequent years. At age 78, in addition to the prominent aphasia, she demonstrated amnesia and slight behavioral change, such as compulsive washing of hands and dishes; however, they did not have a significant effect on her daily activities.\\nOn admission to our hospital, she was alert and cooperative to the examination, but she was occasionally a little reluctant to, particularly memory tests. Sometimes, we had to repeat instructions because she could not understand the first time. However, she understood what should be done following repetitive instructions or written commands.\\nFrontal signs such as disinhibition were occasionally observed, but they were relatively mild. Neurological examination did not reveal motor or sensory disturbance and parkinsonian symptoms. She exhibited bilateral palmomental reflexes but no grasp reflex. Her autonomic functions were well preserved.\\nNeuropsychological assessments were performed between the second and 18th days of hospitalization. Some of her performance seemed to be affected by her impaired listening comprehension or non-serious attitude. For her best performance, clear and plain instructions were repeated until she could understand them. The results of the neuropsychological tests are presented in Table 1.\\nTest scores on WAIS-III and Raven\\'s Colored Progressive Matrices were nearly at the lower limit of normal performance. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test indicated severely impaired visual memory. Apraxia, visual agnosia, and prosopagnosia were not observed.\\nHer speech was fluent without distortion or agrammatism. She demonstrated difficulty in finding words and visual confrontation naming. Although auditory comprehension of sentences and words was impaired, they were due to the difficulty in phonological word processing. Written word comprehension was much better than spoken word comprehension. Results of the Western Aphasia Battery Japanese version revealed anomia, poor spoken word comprehension, and poor writing, but speech production was relatively well preserved. The scores on the repetition task were good, but phonological errors in words were observed. She could read kana (phonogram) and regular kanji (morphogram) words, but she frequently made mistakes when reading irregular kanji words, indicating surface dyslexia. In addition, she demonstrated difficulty writing kanji but not kana. These features in Japanese suggested impairment of semantic memory for words and were often observed in semantic dementia. On the standard tests in Japanese to examine naming and auditory comprehension of 100 high-frequency and 100 low-frequency words, she scored 31/200 on the naming task and 137/200 on the auditory comprehension task. We examined written comprehension for 61 of the 63 words that could not be understood on the auditory comprehension task. We excluded two words because we selected the word that she presented a two-way anomia. Accordingly, her written word comprehension was correct for 31 words (50%).\\nTo evaluate her non-verbal semantic memory, we used the object decision task of the Birmingham Object Recognition Battery and an original semantic memory task, similar to the Pyramid and Palm Trees test. We used the original semantic task because some items in the Pyramid and Palm Trees test are unfamiliar to Japanese people. The results of these tests revealed that the patient also had non-verbal semantic memory impairment. Thus, the patient experienced prominent language deficits throughout the clinical course with verbal and non-verbal semantic memory impairment, which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for svPPA.\\nBy contrast, the patient demonstrated difficulty in repeating and dictating spoken words, which is not a common feature in svPPA. Listening errors were improved by the repetition of target words, and the ability to repeat long sentences was relatively preserved. Therefore, we hypothesized that impaired detection of each phoneme may affect her ability to comprehend and repeat spoken words. The context could also help estimate the words in long sentences.\\nAccordingly, we performed a comprehensive examination of the higher auditory functions of the patient and conducted neuroradiological analyses to reveal the areas associated with the auditory symptoms.\\nAuditory brainstem responses that were elicited with the standard protocol demonstrated normal waves. We used an adapted form of a standard clinical audiometry protocol in assessing frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz. The patient\\'s pure-tone audiometry threshold was within the normal range for her age, with mean threshold values of 36.3 and 36.3 dB on the right and left, respectively.\\nTo examine the higher auditory functions, we performed: (1) temporal auditory acuity and; (2) verbal sound discrimination and recognition. The results are presented in Table 2. Her ability to identify non-verbal sounds and nursery songs was also examined (Supplementary Table 1). We did not analyze these data in detail because several factors including word-finding impairment and semantic memory loss made further analyses difficult.\\nClick counting and click fusion tests were also performed. In the click counting test, the patient was asked to count the number of clicks per second. She was able to count five clicks per second in each ear, which was lower than the 9-11 clicks per second detected by normal controls. In the click fusion test, click sounds were delivered to each ear at various intervals between binaural pulses. The patient was requested to report whether one or two clicks were made. She exhibited binaural fusion at an interval of 8 ms, which was worse than the several milliseconds detected by normal controls.\\nIn Japanese, the ultimate minimum unit of a verbal phoneme sound is expressed as a \"mora.\" A mora was defined as one vowel or a unit of a consonant and a vowel, which corresponded to one kana letter. When measuring the speech recognition score in Japanese, the participants are requested to listen to a mora, a monosyllabic sound, produced verbally and to answer the corresponding kana letter by dictation. Because she was unable to write well enough, the test was performed by recitation. She recognizes 15/20 moras (75%) at 65 dB with the right ear and 16/20 moras (80%) at 65 dB with the left ear. The speech audiogram revealed significantly impaired speech recognition relative to the normal range advocated by the Japanese Audiological Society (Figure 1). Her maximum recognition score in a phonetically balanced word list of the right ear was 75% (15/20 moras) at 65 dB and that of the left ear was 80% (16/20 moras) at 65 dB. Thus, a higher volume was needed to increase the accuracy, and speech recognition accuracy did not exceed 80% in either ear even at the suprathreshold level. The two-mora discrimination tasks using 36 words and 36 non-words were performed. She discriminated 31 of 36 words (normal range; 35.82 +- 0.50) and 28 of 36 non-words (normal range; 35.14 +- 1.06), which was worse than normal controls. These results support the hypothesis that the patient\\'s ability to recognize phonemes was impaired, and she used the context of sentences to estimate the words.\\nThe MRI scans and 123I-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (123I-IMP-SPECT) were performed.\\nEight days after admission, we performed an MRI of the brain using a 3-Tesla MAGNETOM Trio (Siemens Medical Solutions United States, Inc., PA, United States). Three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (3D-MPRAGE) images demonstrated diffuse cerebral atrophy, which was especially marked in the anterior and medial parts of the left temporal lobe (Figure 2A).\\nTo identify brain regions of the patient in which gray matter volumes were smaller than those in patients with typical svPPA, we performed VBM using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM), version 12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo or 3D-MPRAGE image data of 10 patients with typical svPPA as disease controls (mean age, 64 +- 8.0 years; 7 women and 3 men) were used for the analysis. The imaging parameters used for the acquisition of structural imaging data are presented in Supplementary Table 2. The disease controls were retrospectively recruited from the database for the study of dementing illnesses from June 2009 to April 2021 in Tohoku University Hospital and were diagnosed by board-certified neurologists based on the PPA criteria.\\nThe protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tohoku University Hospital (approval nos. 2006-19, 2014-1-278, 2018-1-024, 2019-1-156, and 2020-1-285).\\nA Z-score map of the present patient was created using the mean and standard deviation of the gray matter volume (normalized by the total intracranial volume) of each voxel in the disease controls and the following equation: Z-score = [(Control mean) - (Present patient\\'s value)]/(control standard deviation). Significance was defined as a Z-score above 3.29 (alpha < 0.0005). The Z-score map is exhibited in Figure 2B. Compared with that of disease controls, in the present patient, gray matter volume was significantly smaller in the bilateral perisylvian areas, including the bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), bilateral plana temporale (PT), bilateral Rolandic area and frontal inferior opercula, and left SMG.\\nWe performed ROI-based analyses for gray matter volumes using the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12, http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/) for SPM. The ROIs were defined based on the previous studies that have reported lesions that were associated with the manifestation of word deafness or auditory agnosia. These ROIs were as follows: (i) left and right STG; (ii) left and right PT; (iii) left and right Heschl\\'s gyri; (iv) left and right angular gyri; and (v) left and right SMG. A Z-score of each ROI was calculated by the same equation as that used for creating the Z-score map. Significance was defined as a Z-score above 2.81 (alpha < 0.025/10). The results of the ROI-based analyses are presented in Supplementary Table 3. Compared with those of the disease controls, in the present patient, gray matter volumes were significantly smaller in the left STG (Z-score = 4.28), left PT (Z-score = 3.88), and bilateral SMG (left: Z-score = 4.21; right: Z-score = 3.35).\\nTo assess the patterns of hypoperfusion, 123I-IMP-SPECT data were analyzed with three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections using the normal perfusion database for a Siemens e-cam. There was hypoperfusion from the temporal to the parietal lobes of the left hemisphere, with a more intense reduction from the anterior temporal lobe to the middle and inferior temporal gyri (Figure 2C).\\nBeta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) and phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) in the patient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were quantified on days 11 after admission. The patient\\'s CSF Abeta42 level (1,023 pg/ml) was within the normal range, whereas the CSF p-tau level (68.3 pg/mL) was slightly elevated (reference value of <50 pg/ml).\\nAt her last visit to the hospital (3 years after hospitalization scrutiny), she had developed marked aphasia with phonological mishearing and sentence comprehension disorder. She still understood the written word better than the spoken word, but her understanding of the written word was also greatly declined, due in part to her progressive semantic comprehension disorder. The effort of speech production was not increased, and prosodic articulation was intact. Although she could produce a meaningful speech, she talked about the same content with similar phrasing and only superficial. Behavioral disorders did not worsen, except for obsession with handwashing. She continued to do well physically, and her neurological examinations were unchanged.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"Gender and age: Male, 47 years old\\nChief complaint: Left chest pain\\nThe patient started working for a Korean-style barbecue restaurant from January 5, 2013. His primary duty was to ignite and manage the charcoal used for barbecuing meat at the restaurant. He worked 10 hours a day six days a week. On January 19, 2013, 14 days after he had started working, he suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness while on duty. The length of period for which he lost of consciousness is unknown; however, he was observed as alert and working approximately 30 to 40 minutes prior to the syncope. He regained consciousness without any medical treatment, and no medical attention was provided. However, he complained of a squeezing pain in his left chest for one hour after the initial episode; thereafter, he was brought to hospital via ambulance. Within one hour of arriving at the emergency room, he received cardiac angiography and was admitted to the hospital. Diagnosis at the time of admission was unstable angina and carbon monoxide poisoning. In the emergency room, his electrocardiogram was normal, and his systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 125 mmHg and 74 mmHg, respectively. He was discharged without any complications. On January 31, 2013, he filed a claim with the Korea Worker's Compensation and Welfare Service seeking compensation for the cardiac incidence that was believed to have been related to his work managing the charcoal at the restaurant. Before a decision regarding his claim could be made, the service requested an occupational epidemiological study from the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, and our hospital's occupational and environmental medicine department was given the task of creating the epidemiological report. After further investigation by our department, it was concluded that the patient had carbon monoxide induced cardiomyopathy after exposure to hazardous materials in his work place. The informed consent for epidemiologic investigation and case report is performed.\\nIn August 2012, he had been diagnosed with nonspecific hypertension (Korean standard classification of diseases code I10.9) at Gangdong district health center, but we were unable to find his exact blood pressure measurement at the time of this diagnosis. The patient testified that he was not taking hypertension medication. His medical history was otherwise insignificant. Prior to January 2013, he had visited a local clinic intermittently seeking treatment for shoulder and back pain. According to his medical records until January 19, 2013, the patient had no remarkable family or social history and had never been exposed to any radiologic treatment. However, we were not able to confirm any of these records using the patient's annual medical check-up, which is managed by the National Health Insurance Service. He told the medical personnel at our hospital that he smokes 10-20 cigarettes per day, but his medical record from Samsung Medical Center showed a record of 20 pack-years. He also reported rarely consuming alcohol.\\nAt the emergency room, his systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 125 mmHg and 74 mmHg, respectively, with a pulse rate of 65 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 36 C. Upon auscultation, a rale was heard in both lung fields. Otherwise, no abnormal findings were reported.\\nThe results of the electrocardiogram taken at admission were normal. Table 1 lists the initial and follow-up concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation. The carboxyhemoglobin concentration at the emergency room was 35.8%, which is significantly higher than the normal level. In addition, the results of the cardiac enzyme tests are shown in Table 2. Troponin I, which typically indicates cardiac injury, was considerably elevated.\\nA cardiac angiogram was performed within one hour of admission to the emergency room. In the right coronary artery, a 40% obstruction and thrombotic plaque were found, but the other three branches of the coronary artery appeared normal.\\nA cardiac contrast ventriculography was performed, and the myocardium and cardiac output were found to be functioning normally.\\nInitially, the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 125 mmHg and 74 mmHg, respectively. His pulse and respiratory rates were 65 beats per minute and 18 breaths per minute, respectively, and he had an oxygen saturation of 98% at room temperature. He was given emergency therapy with a sublingual nitroglycerine. After taking the medication, the only response was a sudden drop in his systolic and diastolic blood pressures to 83 mmHg and 53 mmHg, respectively. To counter this low blood pressure, 500 mL of normal saline was infused intravenously, and after confirming the stabilization of his vital signs, the patient underwent an emergency angiocardiogram. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for close observation immediately after the procedure. An angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Losartan ) and aspirin were prescribed, and his systolic and diastolic blood pressures remained level at approximately 135 mmHg and 80 mmHg, respectively. He was discharged from the hospital on January 22, 2013, four days after his first visit to the emergency department.\\nAfter discharge, he did not return to his previous vocation. He visited our outpatient clinic on January 31, 2013, 14 days after the initial attack. At that time, his systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 116 mmHg and 79 mmHg, respectively, and he reported no longer suffering from chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and aspirin were prescribed for continuous use. His last visit was on February 21, 2013 to obtain a copy of his medical record. At the last visit, no chest pain was present, and his systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 143 mmHg and 100 mmHg, respectively.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"According to this patient's insurance employment records, his first full-time recorded job was at a Korean barbecue grill restaurant. He started working there on January 5, 2013 (at 46 years old), and prior to this full-time employment, he worked as a part time employee from June 2, 2012 to August 1, 2012 cleaning tables and washing dishes.\\nAt Korean barbecue grill restaurant, he worked at the charcoal recycler (Figure 1), which was located outside of the restaurant, and his job was to ignite fresh charcoal or revive the flames of burning charcoal to be placed on customers' tables in the restaurant. His informal duties included washing charred material from gridirons and moving stacks of charcoal for storage. He washed used gridirons once or twice a day, usually in the morning or late at night. His job was also to remove large deposits of soot, first using a device called a 'grand', and then using a metallic brush to scrape off any charred materials and minor soot from the gridiron. He performed these tasks outside of the restaurant. It is unknown whether the patient also used chemical agents while cleaning. An exhaust duct is fitted above the recycler. Smoke from the fire at the charcoal recycler is cleared by natural air ventilation, and no additional circulation is provided to ventilate the unwanted smoke.\\nHe worked for six days a week, from 10 AM to 10 PM. He was given an hour and a half lunch break. The quantity of charcoal he managed each day and the amount of his daily workload depended on the number of patrons who visited the restaurant that day. When the restaurant was not busy, he had anywhere between several minutes to one hour of break time throughout his day, and he usually rested next to the charcoal recycler. The estimated amount of charcoal used per day was three to four boxes (6-10 kg). We requested an estimate of the number of customers and daily sales figures from the business owner in an attempt to estimate the quantity of charcoal used per day. However, even with this information, the amount of charcoal handled by the patient or used at a table in this restaurant is difficult to estimate because it can vary greatly for each table. Charcoal is provided at customer's request or after a further order of meat.\\nThe steps to operating the charcoal recycler, which was used by the patient, are as follows. There is on and off button on the bottom of the recycler. After turning on the recycler, the appropriate amount of fresh charcoal for single use is loaded into the charcoal bowl and moved from the bowl to the grid pan. Then, the pan is placed below the ventilation duct in the center of the recycler. With aeration, a flame is applied to start a fire in the charcoal. The flaming charcoal is then placed in a bowl, and the bowl is then placed just under the duct for more aeration. When the charcoal becomes hot enough for grilling, the burning charcoal is moved to another metal container for the use at a customer's table. The whole procedure takes 30 to 40 seconds.\",\n",

He had received the BCG vaccination during infancy. He was an averagely built male with normal general and systemic examination. Genitourinary examination revealed bilateral craggy, hard epididymes, an enlarged and tender right testis, and multiple, superficial, noninfected scrotal ulcers (Fig. 1A and B).\\nUltrasonography showed bilateral normal-sized testes. The right epididymis was enlarged and thickened with a 1.4 x 1 cm sized hypoechoic lesion in relation to the head of the right epididymis and a 2 cm x 1.8 cm sized hypoechoic lesion in relation to the lower pole of the right testis. Internal vascularity was noted. The right testis was not identified separately from the lesion. Furthermore, there was a 1.3 x 0.8 cm sized hypoechoic lesion in the left testis and a 0.7 x 0.6 cm sized hypoechoic lesion in relation to the left epididymis.\\nHis complete blood count and chest radiograph were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 90 mm/h, and the Mantoux was strongly positive with a diameter of 20 mm after 72 h. The urine full report (UFR) showed a field full of pus cells, and routine bacterial cultures were negative.\\nHe underwent surgical exploration where the right epididymis was noted to be enlarged, irregular, and thickened with mild enlargement of the right testis with an irregular surface lesion, favoring chronic epididymo-orchitis (Fig. 2A and B). A right epididymal and testicular biopsy was performed, and histology revealed evidence of granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis favoring mycobacterial TB infection. There was no evidence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia or malignancy. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative for acid-fast bacilli. Pus from the scrotal discharge, the biopsy specimen, and the urine sent for TB culture returned negative.\\nHe was started on category 1 antituberculosis therapy, that is, quadruple antimicrobial therapy for 2 months followed by dual therapy with rifampicin and isoniazid for 4 months, for which there was a good response with healing of the scrotal ulcers. He was compliant, and no significant adverse effects of treatment were noted. However, three (3) months into therapy, he presented with worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, strangury, and acute urinary retention.

There were no transient neurological symptoms or cervical or occipital pain. The next morning, she awoke with severe headache at the back of her head. A Sports Concussion Assessment Test (SCAT) only revealed one symptom (headache). Neuropsychological computerized testing demonstrated excellent performance in all categories; however immediately thereafter, the patient developed severe headache and nausea. At 12 d after the injury, the patient was reassessed and reported a headache with severity of 1 out of 6 localized at the right posterior aspect of her head as her only symptom. Physical examination demonstrated decreased range of motion and tenderness throughout the cervical spine, most prominently at the right greater than left occiput with reproduction of her headache upon palpation. Trigger point injections with 1% lidocaine were performed at eight locations over the bilateral superior trapezius and achieved 50% reduction of her headache for 2 h. This prompted a referral to an interventional anesthesiologist for a diagnostic block of the right greater occipital nerve (GON) and lesser occipital nerve (LON), after which the patient expressed complete relief of all symptoms for 6 h. The patient then was prescribed a multimodal approach to symptom management, including massage therapy, myofascial release, and a right-sided pulsed radiofrequency stimulation of the GON and LON. The patient achieved temporary resolution of her headaches shortly following this last procedure at 166 d after the concussion. While her headaches significantly improved at rest and without rotational movement, any rotational movement during exertion creates headaches that impede participation in sports. Thus the patient has decided to voluntarily retire from volleyball.',\n",

When she was 9 years old, she had worked as a stone crusher for 3 years and was exposed to a large amount of quartz dust for not using any respiratory protective equipment. In 1969, she was diagnosed with silicosis and tuberculosis. She was treated for tuberculosis and was stable. She had no further exposure to dust or other toxic substances, thereafter. On follow-up, her condition had no change. The patient was a life-long nonsmoker and consumed no alcohol. Nor did she receive any medications. \\n On physical examination, the patient looked well, with no palpable peripheral lymph nodes. Occasional wheezing was heard on both lung fields. Laboratory data, including blood tests and serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, and bilirubin, as well as renal function were normal. Skin test for tuberculosis was negative. Three consecutive samples of sputum were negative for acid-fast bacilli by staining and culture. Chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated eggshell calcification of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in the paratracheal, subcarinal, and aorticopulmonary window regions. Bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules were also visible. The lower lobe of the left lung showed a ground-glass, dense shadow. Barium esophagography revealed two fistulas between the middle esophagus and the left main bronchus, immediately tracking into the left bronchial tree (Fig 1). The diagnosis was silicosis with esophagobronchial fistula and aspiration pneumonitis. The patient received antibiotics. An esophageal stent was placed on December 14, 2007. The symptoms improved. \\n The symptoms however recurred within three days. Gastroesophageal endoscopy demonstrated a small ulcerated lesion above the metallic stent, with a small diverticulum 18 cm from the upper incisor; the esophageal mucosa was inflamed and friable. Biopsy revealed chronic inflammation and an ulcer without granulomas, malignancy, or organisms (Fig 2). Another esophageal stent was placed on December 20, 2007. The symptoms improved and the patient was discharged from hospital. \\n After two months, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of severe cough exacerbated by swallowing liquids and solid foods. Gastroesophageal endoscopy revealed a new small mid-esophageal ulcer. Other examinations, including tests for tumor markers, were normal. A tuberculin skin test gave negative results. Over the next few days, the patient reported expectoration of small grayish coral-like calculi with a stony consistency, measuring 5-10 mm in diameter, as well as episodes of coughing. Bronchoscopic examination showed a free broncholithiasis in the left main bronchus, mucosal thickening, and stenosis with no significant airway obstruction of the main bronchus. The broncholithiasis was extracted with no bleeding. Biopsy of the bronchus revealed chronic inflammation, with no evidence of malignant tumor cells or granulomas. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage analyses did not reveal Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, or malignant cells. The diagnosis was silicosis with broncholithiasis and esophagobronchial fistula. \\n The patient continued to have frequent complications and persistent fistula probably related to stasis in the esophagus. Because of her frail condition, we decided to initiate a conservative operative approach and inserted a gastrostomy tube. \\n Two samples of the expectorated materials were analyzed by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), with a Phenom ProX system (Phenom-world Co, the Netherlands), operating at 15 kV. Without any coating on the sample, with SDD high resolution and a high-sensitivity EDS detector, semiquantitative chemical analyses were performed. Mineralogy analysis revealed the broncholithiasis was composed of calcium and phosphate, with no crystals of silica or silicate (Fig 3). \\n After 16 months, in June 2009, the patient was readmitted because of cough, sputum, dyspnea, fever, and night sweating for 10 days. The admission laboratory data included a white blood cell count of 6.65x103/muL (reference range 4.0-10.0x103/muL), hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL (11.0-15.0 g/dL), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 26.38 mg/L (0-3 mg/L), serum albumin level of 4.32 g/dL (35-55 g/dL), serum protein level 7.0 g/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34.9 mm/h (0-20 mm/h). A skin test for purified protein derivative (5 TU) was strongly positive, with an induration of 25 mm with ulceration. The concentrated sputum test result was positive.

       "    'case_text': \"A 32-month-old boy was admitted to our hospital with two days of irritability and fever. He was born with a birth weight of 2.9 kg by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 weeks gestation to a healthy 28-yr-old G3P2 mother. His delivery was non-eventful, but there was flexion deformity of both his middle fingers, so he was transferred to our hospital and underwent many diagnostic tests and physical therapies in January, 2002. He showed mild general hypotonia in that his cry was weak, and he sucked poorly during early infancy. He had epileptic seizures 6 times since the age of 15 months despite taking anti-epileptic medications. A diagnosis of mental retardation complicated by epilepsy was made, and his development was noted to be markedly delayed. He raised his head at age 7 months, sat up at 26 months, and had not yet acquired the ability to stand. He had a flat and mid-hypoplastic face with prognathism, narrow and upward slanting palpebral fissures with hypertelorism, low-set ears, a small crashed nose, widely spaced incisors, carp-like mouth, and round back (Fig. 1). He demonstrated repeated stereotyped behavior like hitting his chin with his palm; this behavior was often associated with emotional outbursts.\\nSoon after admission, a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure was started and lasted approximately one hour; at that time his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, pulse rate 138 bpm, respiration rate 32 bpm, and body temperature 38.5C. Mild throat injection was seen, but other systemic examinations were normal. On neurologic exam, mental status was alert, all cranial nerve exams were normal, and muscle tone in both extremities were decreased to grade IV/IV bilaterally but all deep tendon reflexes were physiologic. There was no spasticity or pathologic reflex. Sensory functions were normal and meningeal irritation signs were absent.\\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed: hemoglobin 12.7g/dL, platelet count 374,000/microL and white blood cell count 11,780/microL. The C-reactive protein was slightly elevated at 19.0 mg/dL on the day of admission and returned to normal 3 days later. Urinalysis was normal. All microbiologic studies were negative. A sleep electroencephalogram revealed intermittent high-amplitude slow wave discharges from the temporo-occipital area, representing mild cerebral dysfunction. On radiologic evaluation, spine radiography revealed mild scoliosis. An echocardiogram was normal.\\nThe characteristic facial features and mental retardation of the patient led us to consider ATR-X syndrome; thus, peripheral RBCs were screened for hemoglobin H (HbH) inclusion bodies. HbH inclusions were detected under the microscope in 1.1% of brilliant cresyl blue stained RBCs, consistent with the diagnosis of ATR-X syndrome (Fig. 2). The patient's father, mother and two sisters were all given the same test; only his mother and eldest sister had the same findings. We performed gene analysis to confirm the diagnosis of ATR-X syndrome. Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood of our patient and his 4 family members was extracted with the Wizard  Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and used as a template for amplification of the ATRX gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was separated into three parts and carried out with sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers containing 20 known major mutation sites (Table 1, Figs. 3, 4). PCR amplification using each primer was conducted with premixture kit (PreMix -Top, Bioneer Inc., Seoul, Korea). Cycling conditions were one cycle at 95C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95C for 30 sec, at an annealing temperature adjusted to each primer's (Tm) for 30 sec, 72C for 30 sec, followed by one cycle at 72C for 7 min. For direct sequencing, the PCR products were purified using a PCR clean-up system offered by Promega. DNA sequencing was performed using the purified PCR products as template, the same primers as those used for template generation, the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and automatic sequencer ABI Prism 3730 XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence data were assembled and compared to that of a previously reported ATRX sequence from accession number Z84487 using the DNAstar software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).\\nMutation analysis for our patient showed a point mutation on the 9th exon in the ATRX gene of thymine to cytosine so that Trp(C), the 220th amino acid, was replaced by Ser(R) (Fig. 5). This missense mutation was reported by Gibbons in 1997. We investigated the same mutation in his 4 family members, and his mother and two sisters were found to be carriers.\",\n",

She had been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing one month prior after exposure to a roommate who tested positive after developing respiratory symptoms. Her only symptom at time of diagnosis was fatigue which resolved by hospital presentation. At baseline, the patient was a high functioning college student with no history of mental illness. Approximately 2 weeks after her COVID-19 diagnosis, she developed insomnia and panic attacks, which progressed over a span of two weeks to acute psychosis manifested by anxiety, agitation, forgetfulness, disorganized thoughts, paranoia, flight of ideas, insomnia and visual hallucinations of her recently decreased grandmother. She was initially prescribed quetiapine, but due to progression of psychosis, she was admitted for further diagnostic workup.\\nBased on the hospital policy regarding admission testing for COVID-19, a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained and tested by PCR, and was noted to be positive. Computed tomography of the head without contrast and magnetic resonance imaging of brain did not demonstrate any abnormalities. Continuous electroencephalogram was normal, and both urine drug screen and blood alcohol test were negative. Acetaminophen, salicylate and heavy metals toxicities were excluded. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, glucose and cellular counts were normal. A meningitis/encephalitis panel (Biofire), which included numerous bacterial and viral targets, was negative. Additional workup including serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody and treponema pallidum antibody was also negative. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, creatinine kinase, thyroid stimulating hormone, folic acid and vitamin B12 were within normal ranges. CSF encephalopathy panels were completed, and the results did not suggest autoimmune encephalopathy as an underlying cause for this patient's acute psychosis.\\nAfter discussion with the microbiology lab, COVID-19 PCR testing was performed on the patient's CSF sample. Though this test is non-FDA approved, multiple reports in the literature showed that the COVID-19 PCR testing on CSF samples has been performed and was positive in some cases. Our patient's CSF sample was negative for COVID-19.\\nThe psychiatry team were consulted, and after assessing the patient's past medical history, clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with hyperactive catatonia. She was started on high-dose lorazepam, with the intention to taper off the dose in the outpatient settings.\",\n",

Full blood count analysis on admission revealed a hemoglobin of 62.0 g/L. Then two units of red blood cells 200 ml plasma were infused to observe the condition continually while defining diagnoses and determining the treatment plan. A brief cystoscopy reported from the previous hospital showed a tumor approximately 2*3*4 cm in size near the bladder neck at 11 o'clock (lithotomy position). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a mass near the bladder neck and massive blood clots in the bladder (Fig. 1). Aiming to wait for hematuria to be controlled and then re-cystoscopy before we can perform the treatment, we consulted the interventional department for bladder tumor vascular embolization (Surgery related images shown in Fig. 2) in the hope of controlling bleeding. Nevertheless, her hemoglobin reduced to 39 g/L due to continuous hematuria prompting transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells and 400 ml plasma urgently the next morning. Consequently, the patient underwent an emergency transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), demonstrating a lot of clots and a solid tumor of about 4 cm near the bladder neck. Once again, 2 units of red blood cells were injected and we gave other symptomatic supportive treatment after surgery to improve the general condition of the patient. To elaborate the change of hemoglobin in patient more intuitively, we specially created a line chart (Fig. 3). Finally, the patient's condition improved and she was discharged smoothly.\\nPostoperative pathological results show that it is bladder myofibroblastic tumor with muscle layer infiltration, finding tumors in the basement (Fig. 4). The results of immunohistochemistry examination showed: SMA (+), ALK (+), Demsin (-); CK (-), with about 20% the tumor cells as Ki-67 positive (Fig.5). Three months after surgery, computed tomography and cystoscopy were reviewed without signs of recurrence and no symptoms such as dysuria appeared in patient.\",\n",

No report was found of the patient taking any HIV therapy in the past. The ART started was abacavir-lamivudine, respectively, 600mg and 300 mg once daily in combination with darunavir 400mg twice daily. Further medical history consists of depression and anxiety, migraines, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and no known use of illicit drugs. She was admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after being apathetic, lethargic, and having a painful cold cyanotic right hand for 4 days. The day of hospitalization she was found very drowsy on the floor by her partner who called the health emergency services immediately. Earlier that week a general practitioner was consulted concerning the painful hand. He suggested this was due to lateral epicondylitis and treated her with NSAID's.\\nIn hospital on admission physical examination revealed a woman with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13/15, conscious but sleepy, oriented, slow speech, and grossly intact cranial nerves. On examination she had cyanotic cold toes on the right foot and a cyanotic right hand extending to the wrist and no pulsations were felt on all 4 limbs (no sign of edema). The patient had a blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg on the left arm and heart rate of 80 beats/min. On auscultation no irregularities were found and the SpO2 indicated 99%. Examination revealed no abdominal abnormalities, but auscultation showed hyperactive bowel sounds. There were no signs of a fever and the urine output was normal. On admission the SAPS score was 40, APACHE-II score 12, MODScore 6, and SOFA score 4; thus the mortality prediction by the SAPS-II score was 24.7%.\\nA central venous catheter was inserted at the Emergency Department due to failed attempts of placing a peripheral canula. Complete blood cell count showed a white blood count of 11.5 x 109/L and no further abnormalities (see supplementary information nr 1). The serum biochemistry showed a CRP of 24 mg/dl, CK 2285U/L, normal renal function with a of sodium of 121 mEq/L and chloride 87 mEq/L. Lactate was 0.7 mmol/L and troponins were negative with two consecutive blood samples. Toxicology screening, including ethanol, were also negative. Coagulation showed normal PT and APTT but D-dimers were raised to 2.2 mg/L (reference normally < 0.5). HIV viral load showed 42 copies/mL and CD4 count was 380 cells per cubic millimeter of blood.\\nBecause of the altered consciousness and lethargy a CT scan of the head was done. This showed no acute intracranial abnormality. During the following days the patient deteriorated and showed increasing unconsciousness and ischemic limbs. Platelet and coagulation disorders were excluded and the lumbar puncture showed no abnormalities. On the 3th day of admission, due to quickly lowering Glasgow coma scale, the patient needed intubation. At the same day a CT angiography of the aorta and lower limbs was done to find a cause for the increasingly cyanotic limbs. Findings included (i) multiple renal infarctions, (ii) narrowing of the external iliac arteries, and (iii) bilateral narrowed femoral-popliteal arteries with multitudinous stenosis or occlusions. The radiologists had difficulties to differentiate between thrombogenic pathology, medically induced arterial spasms, hypovolemia, or congenital hypotrophic arteries.\\nTwo days after intubation, when sedation was stopped, clinical examination showed no improvement of consciousness and fixed pupils were noticed. A CT angiography of the head (Figure 1(a)) showed important supratentorial hydrocephalus with narrowing of cortical sulci and cerebral edema. A normal intracranial perfusion, caliber, and patency of the vertebral arteries and the carotid arteries were seen.\\nOn the 6th day, a head MRI (Figure 1(b)) showed extensive recent ischemia in the cerebellum and hemispheres, more pronounced on the right side than the left side. An obstructive dilatation of the third and fourth ventricle with clear signs of edema in the posterior fossa and pontocerebellar cisterna could be noticed. In addition, beginning herniation of the cerebral tonsils in the foramen magnum was visible. The MRI showed flow void in the basilar arteria and internal carotid arteria. Blood results had shown a slow decline in red blood cell count to 2.74 x 1012/L with a hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dl and a rise in white blood cell count up to 17.8 x 109/L with CRP of 27 mg/dl on the day she passed away. Liver function tests and renal function were slightly elevated.\\nAfter seeing the evolving ischemia with several CT's that could not clearly differentiate between nonocclusive vasospasms or multitudinous stenosis and no sign of underlying peripheral artery disease, the medical history of the patient was re-examined. This revealed a document 10 years prior to the current hospitalisation suggesting former use of ergotamine containing medication (Cafergot ). Current use of ergotamine prior to hospitalization for a severe migraine attack was also confirmed by the partner. All this information in combination with the clinical presentation led to the diagnosis of ET.\\nTreatment was promptly started (3 days after admission), with IV nimodipine, intra-arterial sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin transdermal patches on affected limbs (both legs and right arm). In addition, an epidural catheter was placed for infusion of bupivacaine. The HIV medication was discontinued and to prevent secondary thrombosis anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was started. However, no improvement was noticeable.\\nTwo days after stopping sedation, the patient did not wake up and pupils were fixed. MRI of the head (Figure 1(b)) showed beginning herniation of the cerebral tonsils in the foramen magnum. Neurosurgeons believed that the brain damage due to hydrocephalus was irreversible and that there would be no improvement with external ventricular drainage. Due to the evolving symptomatology and poor prognosis, in agreement with family futile life sustaining therapies were limited and supportive therapy for comfort was started. Patient died 7 days after being admitted at the ICU.\",\n",

The patient had a medical history of Kawasaki disease at two years old; however, she had been healthy and had steadily grown without further management since then. School teachers noticed her attention deficit and hyperactivity in school; however, no treatment was required. One day prior to admission to our department, the patient visited a local clinic with fever, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. As a rapid influenza test conducted using a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for the influenza A virus, baloxavir was administered. A few hours later, the patient presented tachypnea, restlessness, hypoxia (oxygen saturation 86%, ambient air) and drowsiness. The patient presented tachypnea with stridor, paradoxical abdominal breathing, and \"barking\" cough. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated carbon dioxide narcosis: pH; 7.11, pCO2; 84 mmHg, pO2;110 mmHg, HCO3-; 21.1 mmol/L.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with croup and influenza infection and was given nebulized racemic epinephrine and dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously. Since the patient\\'s breathing remained difficult with stridor and her work of breathing was followed by clonic convulsion, intravenous thiamylal (40 mg) was administered and intratracheal intubation using a 5 mm tracheal tube for mechanical ventilation was required. As influenza encephalopathy and airway compromise due to croup with influenza infection was suspected, the patient was transferred to our department for intensive care. In our emergency department, physical examination revealed a body temperature of 40.0  C, blood pressure of 115/68 mmHg, heart rate of 150 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 97% (FIO2 0.8), and Glasgow Coma Scale score of E4VTM4. Her clinical examination revealed a diffuse elastic goiter with bilateral exophthalmoses (Fig. 1A). The patient had normal heart sounds without murmur or gallop. Her lungs were clear when auscultated. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender. Her skin was warm and wet. She had no lower extremity edema. A chest radiograph was normal. The electrocardiogram showed marked arterial tachycardia. Neurological examination showed normal reactive pupils without lateralization signs or neck stiffness.\\nLaboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 14.66 x 109/L; hemoglobin, 11.5 g/dL; serum aspartate aminotransferase 66 U/L (normal range [NR], 10-35 U/L); serum alanine aminotransferase 39 U/L (NR, 0-40 U/L); blood urea nitrogen, 11.3 mg/dL (NR, 8-20 mg/dL); creatinine, 0.37 mg/dL (NR, 0.46-0.79 mg/dL); blood sugar, 142 mg/dL (NR, 73-109 mg/dL); and serum sodium 125 mEq/L (NR, 138-145 mEq/L). Blood lactate level was 0.8 mg/dL. Sputum culture grew oral organisms, but blood culture did not grow any organisms.\\nShe had nasal flaring, inspiratory stridor, accessory respiratory muscle use, and paradoxical abdominal breathing. As there was no swelling on the epiglottis and glottis, the 5 mm diameter tracheal tube was exchanged for one 6 mm in diameter. While slight difficulty in intubation was noted due to subglottic stenosis, airway management was successfully performed, and the patient was sedated with midazolam and fentanyl. Computed tomography showed the trachea was narrowed by the nodular goiter (Fig. 1B). Reconstructed computed tomography of the chest revealed a narrowing of the trachea (Fig. 1C). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed no slow waves or paroxysmal waves. Brain computed tomography was unremarkable. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on the second hospital day; a splenium of the corpus callosum lesion appeared with high intensity on diffusion weighted image (Fig. 2). Initial thyroid function tests revealed hyperthyroidism; free-T4; 6.46 ng/dL (normal range NR 0.9-1.4 ng/dL), free T3; 7.51 pg/mL, thyroid-stimulating hormone under the threshold of sensitivity (0.3-5.0 muIU/mL), thyroglobulin under the threshold of sensitivity (NR < 33.70 mg/mL), and TRAb (thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody) 39.30 IU/L (NR <= 2).\\nEchocardiogram revealed tachycardia >150/min and deteriorated left ventricle ejection fraction (40%), although the patient had no congenital heart disease. As the diagnosis of thyroid storm associated with concomitant high-output cardiac failure was considered, administration of a short-acting beta-blocker (landiolol 1 mug/kg/min), hydrocortisone (300mg/day), thiamazole (30 mg/day), and saturated solution of potassium iodide (170 mg/day) was initiated. Tachycardia and hemodynamics significantly improved after these interventions. Her level of consciousness and thyroid gland swelling causing airway obstruction improved. Thyroid function tests on day 5 demonstrated significantly improved thyroid hormones, free T3 of 3.91 pg/mL and free T4 of 2.84 ng/dL. On day 8, the patient was extubated and transferred to a local hospital on day 11.',\n",

An elastic, hard mass was palpable in his right abdomen on physical examination (Fig. 1). Ultrasonography revealed a nonuniform, hyperechoic mass in the right lobe of the liver. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large solid tumor, with a heterogeneous interior on T2-weighted images, approximately 100 mm in diameter, protruding into the abdominal cavity from the right hepatic lobe (Fig. 2). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed parenchymal nodules considered to be metastases in both lobes of the lungs (Fig. 3). Although liver function test results were within normal ranges, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration was 248,443 ng/mL. A mixed embryonal/fetal hepatoblastoma was diagnosed via liver tumor biopsy.\\nWe planned chemotherapy to treat the hepatoblastoma and lung metastases. However, the day before the scheduled start of chemotherapy, the patient became lethargic and tachycardic, with unstable vital signs that led to shock that was unresponsive to conservative measures. His hemoglobin level was 6.8 g/L. We performed an emergency laparotomy because the patient's small size precluded TAE. During the surgery, the left margin of the tumor ruptured and the tumor contents leaked into the abdominal cavity (Fig. 4). The patient's respiratory and circulatory statuses stabilized after blood transfusion and hemostatic compression of the tumor rupture site. The tumor protruded from the liver, and the capsule had also thinned in other areas that appeared to be in a state of imminent rupture. Therefore, we performed a partial resection of the liver (segments 5 and 6) along the boundary between the tumor and the healthy liver (Fig. 5). In addition, all visible tumor contents in the abdominal cavity were removed. The total operation time was 2 h 54 min, and the intraoperative blood loss volume was 1,190 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. The histological results for the resected tumor were the same as those from the biopsies.\\nThe patient received six courses of chemotherapy (modified SIOPEL-4 regimen) in the pediatric department (Fig. 6). Chest CT performed after chemotherapy showed a barely detectable metastatic lesion in the right lung, which was resected after the fifth chemotherapy treatment, as a reference to the protocol of the SIOPEL-4 regimen. Serum AFP level had decreased logarithmically and remained <10 ng/mL after the completion of chemotherapy.

Growth was normal for height and weight at the 50th percentile. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents for blood and serum draws and analyses. Serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) were initially measured in Khartoum. Serum thyroid function tests (TFTs) after starting treatment including TSH, total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), FT4, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb) were completed (Immulite 1000; Siemens, Munich, Germany and by Elecsys; Roche, Switzerland). Reverse triiodothyronine (TrT3) was measured by radioimmunoassay (Adaltis Italia S.p.A, Bologna, Italy). DNA for sequencing was extracted from peripheral white blood cells using a Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit (Hilden, Germany). DNA from the mother and proband were sent for whole exome sequencing (Novogene, Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 Kit). Whole exome sequencing (WES) results were first scanned for mutations in genes known to be related to TH synthesis or function (Supplemental Table 1). Functional prediction scores Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT), Polyphen2 HumanDiv (HDIV) MutationTaster and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) were tested in silico, allele frequency, and zygosity were all considered in determining the likely cause of the CCH phenotype. The mutation was confirmed by sanger sequencing of DNA from all available family members in order to determine the mode of inheritance.\\nTFTs at 3 months of age revealed a TSH reported as 0.01 mIU/L (reference range 0.4-4.3 mIU/L) and low FT4 of 1.0 pmol/L (reference range 4-10.6 pmol/L). The proband had no family history of thyroid disease, however, both parents reported being first-degree cousins. The proband was diagnosed with CCH and started on levothyroxine (L-T4) treatment. Now, at eleven-year-old on subtherapeutic L-T4 replacement the TFTs demonstrated undetectable TSH on the Elecsys (<0.01) and on Immulite (<0.03) with Low FT4 (Individual II-1, Figure 1). The proband had normal neurological and psychological development on physical examination. WES found a novel missense mutation located on exon 2 of the TSHbeta, c.T141G p.C47W (numbering includes the 20 amino acid signal peptide). Sanger sequencing confirmed that both parents were heterozygous for the C47W mutation, while the proband was homozygous. The mutation was predicted by several in silico methods to have a deleterious effect (SIFT 0.0, Damaging; Polyphen2_HDIV 0.973, probably damaging; MutationTaster 1, disease causing; and CADD 3.17, 16.62). Analysis of the allele frequency in the African and general populations was not available as this is a novel mutation not located in the Genome Aggregation Database.',\n",

The maximum intensity projection image ( Figure 1A ) revealed hypermetabolic lesions in the right thorax ((long arrow) and the right upper abdomen (short arrow). On the axial CT ( Figure 1B ), PET ( Figure 1C ), and fused PET/CT ( Figure 1D ) showed a large irregular lesion in the right lung upper lobe, measuring 8.4 cmx10.2 cmx8.1 cm showing intense 18F-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 13.4.

Coronary stenting was performed, and she was usually treated with oral aspirin anticoagulation and avastatin lipid regulation. Physical examination revealed a palpable and hard mass, in the right area of her kidney. The levels of CA-125 were normal (17.49 U/mL, normal reference values: 0-35 U/mL). The levels of CA-199 were abnormal (36.74 U/mL, normal reference values: 0-35 U/mL). Plasma ACTH, angiotensin and renin concentrations were within the normal range. Other laboratory tests showed no significant abnormalities.\\nWith adequate preoperative preparation, an open right adrenal tumor resection was performed. The intraoperative exploration revealed a cystic solid mass with a size of about 11.0 cmx10.5 cm. In a pathological view, the lesion was a round, dark red in color, and surrounded by a thick membrane and adhered to the surrounding tissues. On histopathological examination, the tumor cells were seen arranged in a swirling flow structure ( Figures 2A, B ). Immunohistochemistry showed: ER (-), PR (-), CD10 (+) ( Figure 2C ), P16 (+), Ki-67 (50%). The postoperative pathological diagnosis confirmed the high-grade ESS with right adrenal gland metastases.

       "    'case_text': \"A 62-year-old female presented with a left RNP. At first presentation in our hospital, the patient reported progressive palsy starting with painless weakness only of her left wrist and long fingers extension 2 years ago. There was no history of any trauma or surgical procedure at her left upper extremity. Within these 2 years, the patient had a checkup by her family doctor and a neurologist. The diagnostic management included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cerebrum and cervical spine, electromyography, electroencephalography, and diagnostic analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples to exclude systemic specific or non-specific infectious or inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. No causes could be found that declared her RNP. So the diagnosis of a radial nerve mononeuropathy with unclear genesis was made, and the patient was treated by oral medication of glucocorticoids and vitamin B12. Additionally, the patient received a prefabricated wrist splint which immobilized only her left wrist in neutral position. Fortunately, stiffness or contractures in the wrist and all finger joints did not appear.\\nOn the first clinical examination in our hospital, an incomplete but severe RNP was present. The strength of extension of the wrist and thumb's extension and abduction was completely lost according to grade 0 in Medical Research Council (MRC) scale (0-5), and the extension in the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints II-V showed palsy grade 3 in MRC scale (Fig. 1A). The sensibility in the peripheral radial nerve area was completely lost. Electromyography revealed an advanced demyelinating radial nerve palsy, but not a complete neurotmesis. On physical examination, there was a painless and non-tender mass around the proximal radius. MRI revealed a submuscular, clearly demarcated and encapsulated tumor with a homogeneous and high-intensity signal similar to subcutaneous fat which surrounds the proximal radius shaft approximately a half part of its total circumference, and without visible septae inside the tumor after gadolinium injection (Fig. 1B). According to these findings, the diagnosis of a benign GL was made by the radiologist, and surgical removal of the tumor with exploration of the radial nerve was detected by us. The tumor was exposed typically through a volar approach. The radial nerve was carefully dissected, it was fixed to the capsule of the GL (Fig. 1C). The encapsulated GL with the size of 11x7x5 cm was completely removed in a monobloc manner. After that, an overstretching-related partial disruption of the nerve with a gap of 1 cm involving a half part of its overall circumference was visible (Fig. 1D). At this time (i.e. 2 years after first neurological symptoms) a sural nerve graft would be inappropriate, and a tendon transfer procedure was detected by us. This could not go beyond the scope of this first surgical procedure because the time of tourniquet already lasted 80 minutes. Additionally, a complete neurotmesis of the radial nerve was not found by electromyography, and so the patient was not cleared up by us on specificities of a tendon transfer procedure preoperatively. Furthermore, the potential risk of problems with wound healing would have been too high due to the necessity of another large surgical incision at this time. The diagnosis of a benign GL was confirmed by histological examination.\\nSix weeks after removal of the GL, a triple tendon transfer procedure that included the transfer of the pronator teres (PT) to the extensor carpi radialis longus/brevis (ECRL/B), the transfer of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) to the extensor digitorum communis (EDC), and the transfer of the rerouted extensor pollicis longus (EPL) to the palmaris longus (PL) was performed (Figs. 2A, B). All tendon sutures were done in the Pulvertaft technique (end-to-side: PT to ECRL/B and FCU to EDC; end-to-end: EPL to PL). The wound healing was uneventful. The left upper extremity was immobilized in a plaster splint for 2 weeks. After that, the movement of elbow joint was freed, whereas the wrist was immobilized in the neutral position with a cast which additionally allowed the active flexion of all finger joints accompanied with its feather-related passive extension for another four weeks. Then, active strengthening of the wrist and all finger joints was started. Four months after surgery, the patient was completely able to perform her daily life activities again.\\nAt the 10-months follow-up, strength of wrist extension, thumb's extension and abduction, and long fingers II-V extension had all improved to grade 4 in MRC scale that was accompanied with a sufficient circumduction of the thumb (Figs. 3A-C). The patient reported that she would undergo the same motion- restoring triple tendon transfer procedure again if it would be necessary.\",\n",

The animal was referred from a 230 cow, year round calving, closed dairy herd in Dumfries and Galloway, south-west Scotland. Cattle are housed all year round and fed a total mixed ration ad libitum. Animals receive leptospirosis, salmonella, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) vaccinations and the herd is a BVD negative herd in accordance with the Scottish government BVD eradication scheme. All cows are treated in the summer with a deltamethrin pour-on product (Butox Swish, MSD Animal Health, Milton Keynes, UK). This cow was homebred and had not left the farm during its lifetime until it was referred into the veterinary school.\\nOn admission the animal was bright, alert and responsive and had a normal appetite and thirst. Tachycardia (100 beats/min) was evident on clinical examination but temperature and respiratory rate were within normal limits. Pallor of oral, conjunctival and vaginal mucous membranes was evident, raising a clinical suspicion of anaemia. There was no vaginal discharge. The remainder of the clinical examination was unremarkable.\\nHistory and initial clinical examination enabled significant calving trauma, ongoing haemorrhage and toxicities to be ruled out as potential differential diagnoses for the suspected anaemia in this animal prior to further investigation.\\nAn EDTA-anticoagulated blood sample taken on admission revealed a markedly regenerative, severe (haematocrit 9.9 %; ref: 24-46 %) macrocytic anaemia with spherocytes and basophilic stippling present on the blood smear (Figs. 1 and 2) (Table 1). Serum biochemistry revealed hyperbilirubinaemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) (Table 2), remaining serum biochemical parameters were all within the reference range. These biochemical abnormalities, together with the presence of a regenerative anaemia raised the suspicion of a haemolytic anaemia.    \\nHaemolytic anaemias commonly result in elevated liver enzymes and increased total bilirubin. Pathologic haemolysis increases haemoglobin degradation and consequent bilirubin formation exceeds the hepatic capacity for uptake and conjugation of bilirubin and excretion into bile, resulting in bilirubinaemia. Upregulation of hepatic function in response to increased need for bilirubin excretion results in increases in liver enzymes seen on serum biochemistry in cases of haemolytic anaemia.\\nThere was no evidence of haemoglobinuria or haematuria on either urine dipstick analysis or laboratory urinalysis.\\nThe presence of inclusion bodies on the blood smear coupled with a positive direct Coombs' test meant a diagnosis of immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia could be made with suspected underlying infectious aetiology. The inclusion bodies seen on the blood smear were confirmed to be Mycoplasma wenyonii parasites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\\nGenus-specific Mycoplasma primers generated a specific 270 bp product from whole blood DNA. The Sanger-sequenced product (Source BioScience, Lanarkshire, UK) showed high sequence similarity to Mycoplasma wenyonii str. Massachusetts (NCBI GenBank accession number CP003703 with 97.8 % (forward primer) and 98.7 % (reverse primer) probability.\\nThere is a paucity of information available regarding the treatment of either haemotropic mycoplasmas or immune mediated haemolytic anaemia in cattle. Tetracyclines have been reported to be effective in treating both M.haemofelis and M.suis infections and there are reports of M.wenyonii in cattle being treated with oxytetracycline, however response to treatment has been variable. In light of this, oxytetracycline was the treatment of choice in this case. Corticosteroids were considered, as part of this clinical presentation was immune-mediated; however, previous work has shown that Coombs' positive cats infected with M.haemofelis respond to antibiotic treatment alone. In addition to this, there are some cases where concurrent corticosteroid therapy has been shown to delay the clearance of haemotropic Mycoplasma from the blood. It was decided to treat with oxytetracycline alone initially and only use concurrent corticosteroid if warranted by deteriorating clinical status of the animal in spite of appropriate antibiotic therapy. In light of the degree of anaemia exhibited by this animal blood transfusion was considered, however due to the clinical stability of the cow and concerns regarding the possibility of adverse transfusion reactions it was elected not to perform a blood transfusion on this occasion.\\nThe cow was treated with 20 mg/kg long-acting oxytetracycline (Alamycin LA 300; Norbrook, Newry, Northern Ireland, UK) every three days by deep intramuscular injection. A blood sample was repeated 48 h following the commencement of treatment which showed a good initial response; haematocrit increased from 9.9 % to 15.2 % (Table 1), and total bilirubin reduced from 23 mumol/l to 6 mumol/l (Table 2). In addition, all elevated liver enzymes were reduced (Table 2). The cow initially improved in demeanour and the mucous membrane pallor resolved as the haematocrit improved, which was to be expected.\\nBlood samples for haematology and biochemistry were repeated regularly for the duration of treatment. The haematological improvement continued for the first week following treatment, from which point no further improvement in haematological parameters occurred despite continued treatment (Table 1). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin showed rapid initial improvement then remained within the reference range for the duration of treatment (Table 2). Blood taken on the 8th of December 2014 was PCR negative for Mycoplasma species however there were still a few inclusion bodies seen in small numbers of erythrocytes, which were suggestive of continued Mycoplasma species infection in spite of a negative PCR result. A direct Coomb's test was now negative.\\nAfter an initial improvement in demeanour and haematological and biochemical parameters, the cow failed to improve further and approximately three weeks after admission started to deteriorate in demeanour with the development of a soft cough and a persistent tachycardia (heart rate persistently greater than 90 beats per minute). The decision was made to euthanase the cow on the 19th of December 2014, one month after presentation to the SCPAHFS due to limited further improvement and because the prognosis was considered to ultimately be poor.\\nA blood sample was taken immediately prior to euthanasia and submitted for repeat PCR testing. This blood sample was positive on PCR for Mycoplasma species however, this could not be confirmed to be M.wenyonii on sequence analysis.\\nPost mortem examination showed mild hepatomegaly, mild enlargement of the spleen with prominent lymphoid follicles within the white pulp (Fig. 3) and mild lymphadenomegaly of the right pre-scapular lymph node. Samples of spleen, lymph node, liver and bone marrow were collected in fixative (10 % neutral buffered formalin) and processed for paraffin embedding and sectioning for histological examination. Sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H & E). An additional section of liver was stained with Perl's Prussian Blue. \\nHistological examination of the spleen confirmed expansion of the lymphoid follicles with prominent germinal centres within the white pulp. The red pulp was moderately congested with an increase in haemosiderin-laden macrophages. In the right pre-scapular lymph node, there was an increase in size and number of lymphoid follicles with expanded germinal centres, along with congestion of the paratrabecular and medullary sinuses. Numerous aggregates of nucleated erythroid precursors and variable numbers of megakaryocytes were noted in the medullary cords (Fig. 4). Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were also prominent in the lymph node. Large numbers of erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes were noted in a section from a bone marrow sample. Increased intracytoplasmic accumulation of haemosiderin (confirmed by Perl's Prussian Blue staining) was also noted in Kupffer cells in hepatic sinusoids (Figs. 5 and 6).   \\nIncreased haemosiderin accumulation in the spleen, lymph node and liver is consistent with increased erythrocyte turnover as a result of extravascular haemolysis in the context of haemolytic anaemia. The occurrence of extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) in the lymph node, characterised by a predominance of erythroid and megakaryocytic elements and the apparent increase in erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow are both consistent with a regenerative response secondary to anaemia.\",\n",

It was palpable as a soft 0.5 cm mass. Cranial nerve examination was without deficits, and no cervical lymphadenopathy was detected. He had a history of left parotidectomy for Warthin tumor three months prior and Mohs surgery of the right cheek for nonmelanoma skin cancer five years prior. CT scan revealed a 1.4 x 1.3 cm right superficial parotid mass. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, a right superficial parotidectomy was performed. Intraoperative frozen section examination revealed mucoepidermoid carcinoma, intermediate grade. Thus, the decision was made to perform a right deep lobe parotidectomy with preservation of facial nerve and right neck dissection. The patient underwent definitive IMRT 60Gy radiation therapy following recovery from the surgery and has been followed up for four months.\\nOn gross examination of the resected right superficial parotidectomy specimen, serial sections revealed a 1.3 x 1.1 cm firm, tan-white intraparenchymal tumor nodule with ill-defined borders. In addition, a cyst measuring 0.6 cm was present 1.1 cm away from this tumor, with grossly unremarkable intervening parenchyma. Histologic examination of the nodule showed two distinct lesional components that were well-demarcated from each other with no transition zone (Figure 1(a)). One portion showed well-circumscribed multinodular proliferation composed of dark blue, basaloid tumor cells arranged in nests with frequent peripheral palisading. Cytologically, the tumor cells demonstrated ovoid, basophilic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Distinct, dense ribbons of eosinophilic hyaline material were noted surrounding the islands of tumor cells (Figure 1(b)). These histologic findings were those of basal cell adenoma, membranous type. Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and CK5/6 highlighted a prominent abluminal population, and CK7 highlighted patchy cells throughout, with a subset of luminal cells staining intensely (Figure 2). The other portion of the tumor was characterized by a multinodular proliferation of multiple distinct cell populations arranged in frequent mucin-containing glandular spaces and as solid tumor cell nests. The lesional cells consisted of an admixture of mucous cells (mucocytes), polygonal epidermoid cells, and intermediate cells (Figure 1(c)). A special stain for mucicarmine highlighted intracellular mucin within the mucocytes as well as the extracellular mucin (Figure 1(d)). Cytologic atypia was moderate to focally marked. Necrosis was not seen and the mitotic activity was scant. Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and CK5/6 highlighted a predominant abluminal epidermoid/squamoid cell population, and CK7 highlighted mucocytes and cells adjacent to extracellular mucin of the glandular lumens. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 3-4% (Figure 2). The histologic findings were consistent with intermediate-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Microscopically, the grossly noted 0.6 cm cyst consisted of a simple cyst composed of cytologically bland cuboidal lining cells with focal mucinous metaplasia, consistent with a salivary duct cyst. The parenchyma between this region and the tumor was histologically unremarkable as was the deep lobe of the parotid. Eighteen sampled lymph nodes were negative for tumor.\\nTo further investigate the association between the two tumor components, molecular profiles of both were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (FoundationOne , Cambridge, MA). Among the 315 genes tested, the MEC and BCA components shared five genomic variants in common, all characterized as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Additionally, each showed one or two distinct likely driver genomic alterations (Table 1). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MAML2 rearrangement, a genetic alteration commonly found in MEC, was attempted, but testing was uninformative as no interpretable hybridization signals were present to complete the analysis.',\n",

Upper endoscopy demonstrated a subepithelial mass with an overlying ulceration and an adherent clot in the duodenal bulb, with no histological evidence of a malignancy (Figure 1). Computed tomography (CT) obtained during the initial hospitalization demonstrated air within an inflamed gallbladder that contained stones and sludge, as well as a rounded, well-circumscribed mass in the duodenum (Figure 2). Liver enzymes at the time were notable for aspartate aminotransferase 182 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 167 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 176 IU/L, and total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL. The lesion, which was the source of the bleeding, was presumed to be a gastrointestinal (GI) stromal tumor, and he was referred for an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).\\nEUS revealed a 21-mm hypoechoic ulcerated subepithelial mass with a duct-like structure in the duodenal bulb. During suction to appose the lesion against the tip of the echoendoscope, the mass decompressed, and the areas of ulceration morphed into 2 small orifices draining bile and small stones (Video 1; Figure 3). Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated resolution of the mass-like density in the duodenum (Figure 4). A small bile duct stone and subtle contrast opacification of the cholecystoduodenal fistula was also identified (Figure 4). The patient had multiple comorbid conditions including metastatic prostate cancer, chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C infection, congestive heart failure, ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation.

Endocrine investigation revealed hypopituitarism with markedly decreased levels of early morning cortisol, thyroid hormone with low thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Physical examination was unremarkable. There were no visual deficits on ophthalmological examination. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography showed a significant mass effect on the pituitary gland, with a giant right cavernous ICA thrombotic aneurysm measuring 26.4 mm at the largest diameter [Figures 1a and b]. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a right cavernous ICA aneurysm [Figures 1c and d]. Considering the possibility of pituitary apoplexy, hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (40 mg/day) and levothyroxine (25 mg/day) was initiated without a hormone loading test. Bayaspirin tablets (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel tablets (75 mg/day) were also administered for 2 weeks before the treatment. One month after the beginning of hormone replacement therapy, the aneurysm was treated using a pipeline Flex device (size: 5.0 mm x 16 mm; Medtronic). Immediately after pipeline placement, the flow-diverting effect and good patency of the stent were confirmed [Figures 2a-c]. The patient tolerated the procedure well, without any complications.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2013 showed severely dilated and hypertrophied RV (Figure 1A). In June 2014, the patient was admitted with worsening heart failure. He was hypotensive (blood pressure: 86/57 mmHg), lactate was 2.8 mmol/L. He also had evidence of multiorgan failure requiring inotropic support. Catheterization revealed significantly increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) at 52 mmHg and PVR at 5.5 wood units (WU), as well as decreased cardiac index (CI) at 1.7 L/min/m2. Due to the patient's inotrope dependence and prohibitive elevation in PVR (> 4 WU), he underwent implantation of a Heart Ware HVAD  for systemic RV support. He tolerated the procedure very well. VAD flows were titrated with echocardiographic monitoring, RV chamber size decreased from 6.2 cm at low VAD speed [2,740 revolutions per minute (rpms)] to 5.3 cm at high VAD speed (2,780 rpms) (Figures 1B,C). He was successfully discharged on post-operative day 22.\\nB-type natriuretic peptide decreased markedly post VAD implantation. Cardiac MRI could not be repeated due to the presence of the VAD, but chest x-ray showed significant decrease in RV size between post-operative day 1 and 10 months postoperatively (Figures 1D,E). The patient has not had any unplanned hospital readmissions and was able to walk more than one mile daily without symptoms after that. Repeat catheterization in 4 months showed complete normalization of PVR at 1.5 WU, and a CI of 3 L/min/m2. MPAP was 27 mmHg at that time, it continued to decrease to 14 mmHg in 2016.\\nBecause of normalization of pulmonary resistance, he was ultimately listed for cardiac transplantation (UNOS status 1B). A suitable donor was identified in February 2017. He underwent VAD extraction and orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) at that time. Surgical course was complicated by significant blood loss, requiring multiple units of blood products. Otherwise, he tolerated the transplantation very well. Immune suppression was induced with anti-thymocyte globulin, then transitioned to a regimen consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Symptoms continued to improve at 3 years post-transplant (New York Heart Association class I) and the patient's quality of life improved given that he is more active.

The patient was a collegiate cheerleader and the pain started suddenly when performing a stunt at cheerleading practice. Immediately after the injury, she was treated conservatively with Meloxicam and rehabilitation with her team's athletic trainer. After the initial assessment and treatment, she was referred to a formal physical therapist to work on her core and hip strength. A rectus abdominus muscle tear was suspected, and an abdominal musculature ultrasound was performed demonstrating a 2.7 x 1.7 x 3.6 cm full-thickness, grade 3 tear of her distal right rectus abdominus muscle (Fig. 1). Up to the time of the ultrasound, the patient continued to practice with the team, however, she had been removed from some stunts that were becoming too difficult for her to perform. After the diagnosis of the tear by ultrasound, the patient decided the pain was too severe to allow her to continue competing as a division 1 athlete and was causing her significant distress. She was counseled that this injury could take several weeks to months to fully resolve and that her pain was to be expected at that time. She ultimately decided to end her cheerleading career because of the injury to focus on her education.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of pain in the right flank and new-onset painless haematuria. His medical history was notable for 30 pack-years of smoking. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right flank. The results of the complete blood count and metabolic panel were normal. Creatinine and urea nitrogen were 0.87 mg/dl and 4.30 mmol/L, respectively. Urinalysis showed more than 15977 red cells per high-power field and more than 62 white cells per high-power field. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen result was 5.05 nanograms per millilitre (normal range, 0 to 5.0 nanograms per millilitre). A urine culture revealed Streptococcus agalactiae, and the results of urine cytologic testing suggested that the transitional cell carcinoma was arranged in a papillary structure with mild-moderate heterogeneity of cells, and urothelial carcinoma was considered ( Figure 1A ). CTU showed a filling defect in the lower right ureter with right hydronephrosis ( Figures 1B, C , arrow). Preoperative examination of the bladder with a rigid cystoscope was unremarkable. After the treatment options were discussed, the patient chose to undergo 3D totally intracorporeal laparoscopic kidney autotransplantation, bladder cuff excision, and segmental resection of the proximal two-thirds of the ureter based on the concept of membrane dissection.\\nAfter general anaesthesia, a cystoscope was used to examine the bladder, and it showed normal mucosa and no tumour invasion at the bilateral ureteral outlet. The patient was placed in a 70  oblique position on the left side and treated with epirubicin 40 mg bladder irrigation chemotherapy for 30 minutes, and a 10 mm trocar and laparoscopic lens were placed through an incision at the right edge of the rectus abdominis muscle next to the umbilicus. A 12 mm and 5 mm trocar was placed under the costal margin in the midclavicular line and under the glabella, respectively, and a 5 mm trocar was placed at the intersection of the umbilical level and the right anterior axillary line and at the umbilicus and the right anterior superior iliac spine, respectively. The membrane was separated from the right kidney, right ureter, vena cava, and digestive system. The method used for membrane dissection in our study has been previously described in the literature.\\nFirst, the right Toldt\\'s line was incised, and the digestive system was separated along the level between the posterior lobe of the right colonic mesentery and the anterior layer of Gorota\\'s fascia as follows: superiorly to the base of the liver, inferiorly to the iliac vessels, and medially to the left side of the vena cava. Then, the right renal artery and vein were freed as well as the right ureter. The right middle ureter was clamped using a hem-o-lock clip ( Figures 2A, B ), the right ureter-bladder was cuffed and resected, and the cystotomy incision was sutured ( Figure 2C ). Then, the following lymph nodes were cleared sequentially: right hilar lymph nodes, right perirenal fat, paraventricular lymph nodes, right internal and closed foramen lymph nodes, and right external iliac lymph nodes. The right renal artery and vein were fully clamped and disconnected, respectively, and the right vena cava was sutured ( Figures 2D, E ). The right kidney and right ureter were quickly removed through an incision of approximately 7 cm in length in the right iliac fossa. We used a flexible ureteroscope in the intraoperative management of the kidney with the aim of confirming the presence of metastatic tumours in the renal pelvis and ureter. The right kidney and right renal vessels were trimmed under cold ischaemic hypothermia supplemented with small ice cubes, and a ureteral stent was placed in the right ureter. The right internal iliac vein was clamped at both ends by bulldog clips, and the right vein was reconstructed end-to-end with the right internal iliac vein ( Figure 2F ). Similarly, the right artery was reconstructed end-to-end with the right internal iliac artery ( Figure 2G ). Then, the right ureter was reconstructed end-to-end with the right posterior wall of the bladder ( Figure 2H ), and finally, the right internal iliac vein and arterial hobgoblin were released to restore blood flow to the right kidney, which was rich in vitality ( Figure 2I ). The right perirenal and pelvic drains were left in place, and each incision was sutured. The patient\\'s operative time was 534 minutes, and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 100 ml. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 8th day after surgery.\\nFinal pathological analysis revealed high-grade papillary ureteric carcinoma, with negative surgical margins, no invasion of the vasculature and nerves, and no metastasis in the lymph nodes (including right renal hilar, inferior vena cava parietal, right external iliac, right internal iliac, and closed hole). The pathological stage of the tumour was pT2N0Mx. The patient was discharged from the hospital and instructed to take oral aspirin for anticoagulation therapy, and on the 5th day, painless haematuria appeared. Then, we performed \"transurethral cystoscopy\", and no significant bleeding was found in the bladder intraoperatively. We considered bleeding from the right uretero-vesical anastomosis due to postoperative oral aspirin. A regimen of 3 courses of gemcitabine 1.7 g in combination with cisplatin 120 mg chemotherapy was initiated on 23 January, 2022. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a parameter representing kidney function. The GFR of the patient\\'s transplanted kidney was 48.6 ml/min at 4 months after surgery.\\nOn 18 April, 2022, the CTU examination was repeated and showed a right ascending colon tumour with a size of approximately 5*4 cm, so laparoscopic radical surgery was performed for a right hemicolectomy. The postoperative pathology suggested intermediately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon, and the patient\\'s postoperative genetic test results suggested microsatellite instability (MSI) status of high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), and the immunohistochemistry (IHC) results showed mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), indicating a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS). Immunotherapy with 120 mg of BCG bladder instillation was started on 12 May, 2022. One year after the procedure, renal function was normal, with a creatinine level of 0.93 mg/dl. The patient was in good health and showed no sign of haematuria. Surveillance cystoscopy and CTU examination showed no evidence of disease recurrence ( Figures 3A, B ). The postoperative cosmetic results were satisfactory ( Figure 3C ), and the patient is still undergoing close follow-up ( Figure 4 ).',\n",

The tics evolved to include sniffing, throat clearing, and blinking. The patient also developed significant attentional disturbances and subsequent difficulties in school. At the age of 12 years, he was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome. Multiple medications were tried. Typically, his tics would initially respond well to the various medication trials, but he would always relapse within 5-6 weeks. His medication history includes guanfacine (1 mg twice a day), clonidine patch (0.1 mg patch daily), clonazepam (up to 1 mg at bedtime), risperidone (up to 0.5 mg three times a day), propranolol (up to 10 mg three times a day), and levetiracetam (up to 750 mg twice a day) for tics, as well as atomoxetine (up to 60 mg) for attentional deficits. From the ages of 12 to 18 years, he did very poorly in school, which was likely due to a combination of attention deficit disorder and the sedating side effects of his various medications. He had very mild compulsive tendencies, such as excessive counting, but this did not interfere with functioning. Towards the end of high school, he weaned himself off all his medications as none were particularly effective, and currently he is not taking any medications.\\nDuring high school, the neck-turning tic began to be pervasive. He discovered that if he applied gentle pressure to anywhere along his head circumference, the tics, and the accompanying urge to perform them, would be completely quelled. Touching his lower face was also effective, although less so. His sensory tricks included resting the back of his head against a wall, resting his chin on his hand, and wearing a bandana or hat. Unfortunately, his school did not allow headgear and this limited his ability to control his neck tic. Now that he is at university, he wears a baseball cap every day with much success in tic control. His other tics, such as sniffing and blinking, which are significantly less bothersome than his neck tics, are not responsive to sensory tricks. Video 1 demonstrates this phenomenon.\",\n",

Significant past medical history included an episode of pneumonia 4 months prior and meningitis 2 months prior to this admission. Pneumonia resolved with 7 days of levofloxacin (LVFX), and meropenem (MPEM) was administered for meningitis for 14 days. In both instances, no etiology was detected. The patient was addicted to alcohol, consuming approximately 150 mL of ethanol each day. Physical examination on admission revealed high fever of 38.5C and arrhythmia. Neurological examination identified nuchal rigidity and mild disorientation, but no paresis or numbness. The patient was severely emaciated (height, 163 cm; weight, 43 kg). Although activities of daily life had been sufficient for independence before admission, he was unable to walk without assistance due to severe emaciation; a wheelchair was required for mobility.\\nPeripheral blood analysis on day 4 revealed mild pancytopenia (white blood cell count, 6,200 /muL; neutrophil count, 5,208 /muL; lymphocyte count, 682 /muL; hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelets, 88,000 /muL); and CRP, 1.44 mg/dL, representing a mild increase. The CD4 T-cell count was 23 /muL, but negative results were obtained for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and polymerase chain reaction for HIV. Serum testing for beta-D-glucan, Aspergillus antigen and cryptococcal antigen were all negative. Tests to detect soluble interleukin 2 receptor, myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and antinuclear antibody markers for collagen disease were also all negative. The first cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, on day 4, revealed: cell count, 1,244 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 90%; monomorphonuclear cells, 10%); protein, 273 mg/dL; and glucose, 47 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, 135 mg/dL) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Gram staining and smear for acid-fast bacilli yielded negative results. Adenosine deaminase and cryptoccocal antigen were likewise negative. Although CSF cultures were incubated for 2 weeks for bacteria and 8 weeks for mycobacteria, both appeared to yield negative results. At the same time, two sets of blood cultures were ordered and incubated for 4 weeks, and were still negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the head on admission showed a low-density area in the left uncal region and parietal cortex (figure not shown).\\nOn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on day 14, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed a high-intensity spot in the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle of the brain (Fig. 2A), implying ventriculitis. However, this region appeared iso-intense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping (Fig. 2B). DWI also showed a high-intensity lesion with ADC iso-intensity in the left parietal cortex, judged as representing some kind of inactive lesion (figure not shown). On fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, a high-intensity lesion was detected in the white matter adjacent to the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle (Fig. 2C). The parietal cortex lesion was also signal hyperintense on FLAIR (figure not shown). Pneumonia was not detected on chest roentgenography or CT (figure not shown).\\nOn day 4, bacterial meningitis was suspected and treatment with vancomycin (VCM), ceftriaxone (CTRX) and piperacillin (PIPC) was initiated (Fig. 1). Rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol (EB) were concomitantly administered for possible tuberculous meningitis. On day 10, a second analysis of CSF revealed non-significant changes compared with the first analysis: cell count, 802 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 90%; monomorphonuclear cells, 10%); protein, 196 mg/dL; and glucose, 34 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, not determined) (Table 1). High fever had not resolved (Fig. 1). Because fungal meningitis was not able to be ruled out, liposomal amphotericin-B (L-AMB) was started. The regimen of VCM, CTRX, and PIPC regimen was switched to panipenem/betamipron (PAMP/BP) and minocycline (MINO). RFP, INH and EB were terminated due to low adenosine deaminase levels in the first CSF analysis. Although negative results were obtained for the CSF culture for fungi, fever resolved several days after beginning L-AMB (Fig. 1) and findings from the third CSF analysis on day 18 had improved: cell count, 128 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 83%; monomorphonuclear cells, 17%); protein, 117 mg/dL; and glucose, 38 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, not determined) (Table 1, Fig. 1). Due to bone marrow suppression, L-AMB (100 mg once a day) was terminated on day 21.\\nFindings from the fourth CSF analysis, on day 29, showed further improvement: cell count, 40 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 65%; monomorphonuclear cells, 17%); protein, 152 mg/dL; and glucose, 41 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, 101 mg/dL) (Table 1 and Fig. 1).\\nThese improvements in CSF findings suggested that an undetected fungi was the causative microorganism and that L-AMB had been effective. Fever of 37-38C reappeared around day 35 (Fig. 1), and oral fluconazole (FCZ) was started on day 36. MINO and PAPM were continued until days 28 and 35, respectively. Fever did not resolve and loxoprofen was started on day 46. Fever reduced initially, but relapsed at 37-38C around day 60. A fifth CSF analysis on day 50 revealed worsened findings: cell count, 1,311 /muL (polymorphonuclear cells, 85%; monomorphonuclear cells, 15%); protein, 732 mg/dL; and glucose, 44 mg/dL (simultaneous blood glucose, not determined) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). DWI on days 50 and 71 revealed exacerbation of the ventriculitis (Fig. 2D and G) and partial ADC hypointensity (Fig. 2E and H). Spread of a hyperintense region was evident in the white matter adjacent to both lateral ventricles on FLAIR imaging (Fig. 2F and I). The area of high intensity may have represented brain edema due to ventriculitis. Direct paracentesis of the ventricle was considered, but the family of the patient declined to consent. Although CSF and MRI findings worsened, we persisted in suspecting fungal infection and continued with FCZ.\\nDisturbance of consciousness slowly worsened (Fig. 1), and aphasia and left hemispatial neglect gradually appeared around day 60. MRI on day 71 showed the ventriculitis and hyperintense lesion in the white matter adjacent to both lateral ventricles on FLAIR imaging had become more severe (Fig. 2D-F). Neither swelling of the brain nor encephalocele was seen. On days 71 and 84, pneumonia complicated the hospital course, resulting in administration of CTM for 9 days and MEPM for 11 days, respectively (Fig. 1). In both episodes of pneumonia, no causative bacteria were detected. Although the sixth CSF analysis on day 80 revealed improvements in cell count (268 /muL; polymorphonuclear cells, 86%; monomorphonuclear cells, 14%), no improvements were seen in protein (753 mg/dL) or glucose (34 mg/dL; simultaneous blood glucose, 104 mg/dL) (Table 1 and Fig. 1). FCZ was continued because of improvements in cell counts. The general condition of the patient did not improve and he died on day 99 due to transtentorial hernia, as confirmed on head CT (figures not shown). The transtentorial hernia was attributed to brain edema ventriculitis and meningitis. Repeated cultures of CSF and blood until death had consistently yielded negative results for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria.\\nAutopsy was performed 2 hours after death. On opening the cranium, yellowish pus flowed from the left ventricle (Fig. 3A). This pus was not malodorous, and Gram staining revealed a delicate, branching, filamentous organism (Fig. 3B). Although acid-fast staining was not performed, the organism was determined to be a Nocardia species from the colony appearance, and was identified as N. araoensis by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Pus was observed throughout the basal cistern and pontomedullary cistern (Fig. 3C). In formalin-fixed sections of brain, both lateral ventricles were filled with pus (Fig. 3D) and some small abscesses that had remained undetectable on MRI were seen in the cerebral white matter (Fig. 3E). No infectious lesions were identified in other organs, including the lungs and skin. No evidence of pancytopenia, such as hematological disease or liver cirrhosis, was found. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing showed that only doxycycline (DOXY), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and MINO seemed ineffective (Table 2).

       "    'case_text': \"A 39-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2022, presented to the gynecologic oncology clinic complaining of persistent vaginal spotting for the prior 5 months. She had a cesarean delivery 3 months before the onset of symptoms. Three months before her presentation, the patient resumed normal menses, which was associated with persistent spotting. She denied abdominal or vaginal pain, dyspareunia, fever, nausea, vomiting, or vaginal discharge. During these months, she also complained of progressive fatigue and exercise-induced shortness of breath.\\nHer obstetric history was significant for 2 cesarean deliveries, the first in 2006 and the last 3 months before the onset of her symptoms. The indication for both surgeries was failure to progress. During the last cesarean delivery, the obstetrician reported that the subcutaneous tissue was very thin but densely adherent to the fascia, with significant scarring. Also, the bladder was densely adhered to the uterus. The uterine incision was low transverse, just above the lower uterine segment. Uterine closure was performed in 3 layers. The postoperative period was uncomplicated. The patient had a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy in 2008. Her last Pap smear, 6 months earlier, had normal findings.\\nHer past medical history was positive for iron deficiency anemia and migraine headaches. She reported being allergic to nabumetone. She was taking 325 mg of ferrous sulfate twice per day.\\nOn physical examination, the patient had stable vital signs. Her weight was 63.9 kg, height was 1.7 m, and body mass index was 22.1. The pelvic examination revealed normal external female genitalia and some dark blood in the vagina vault, but no visible cervical or vaginal lesions. The uterus was mobile without any masses or nodularity.\\nAs part of the patient's work-up, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and an ultrasonogram were obtained and showed dehiscence at the lower uterine segment, with a collection of blood in the area of the dehiscence and hematocolpos (Figure 1). These findings led to the diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to uterine scar dehiscence. Treatment options with associated risks and benefits were discussed with the patient, and she opted for a da Vinci-assisted laparoscopic repair of the lesion.\\nAfter general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a low lithotomy position, and an 8-mm skin incision was made in the umbilical area. A pneumoperitoneum was created, and three 5-mm incisions were made:2 pediatric da Vinci ports and 1 assistant port were placed. The uterus was densely adhered to the abdominal wall, so adhesiolysis was performed using sharp dissection and electrocautery. The bladder flap was developed using sharp dissection, mobilizing the bladder from the lower uterine segment. The defect in the lower uterine segment was identified. At this point, hysteroscopy was initiated, and the hysteroscopic view showed an approximately 3-cm defect in the lower uterine segment and a thin scarlike membrane covering it; however, during the hysteroscopy, the laparoscopic view showed a bulging lower uterine segment (Figure 2). The intrauterine cavity appeared to be normal. A uterine incision was made using electrocautery and the blood was removed. The edges of the defect were freshened using unipolar electrocautery. The uterus was closed using 0-Vicryl sutures in 2 layers. The sutures were inspected hysteroscopically. After copious irrigation and evacuating the pneumoperitoneum, the trocars were removed and the skin was closed using 4-0 Caprosyn sutures. Blood loss was <50 mL. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 1.\\nThree months later, she had her first follow-up examination and was asymptomatic. She had spotting for about 2 weeks after surgery but has since had no problems. Menses were adequate with no intermenstrual spotting.\",\n",

In the physical examination there was an indolent, fluid-filled swelling intraorally in the left mandible region with signs of infection. In his medical history an adenocarcinoma of the lung (pT3 pN2b L1 V1 Pn1 R1 M0) was treated operatively with the resection of the right superior lobe and radiotherapy 16 months ago. The patient is a former smoker, not taking regular medication. The common radiological diagnostics, including computed tomography (CT), showed a mandible fracture (Fig. 1) and abnormal perimandibular soft tissue as well as accentuated cervical lymph nodes (level IIa, left). Immunohistochemical analyses of a subsequent intraoral biopsy of the mandible identified a metastasis of the primary adenocarcinoma of the lung (strong expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1)). Using a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) further peripheral metastases could be excluded (Fig. 2). The interdisciplinary tumor board recommended a tumor resection and neck dissection. After a left hemimandibulectomy and left sided-selective functional neck dissection (level I-III) a CAD/CAM microvascular fibula transplant was used for reconstruction. The postoperative histopathological analysis revealed lymph node metastases in levels Ia, Ib and IIa.

       "    'case_text': \"A 74-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to steroid-resistant bilateral uveitis persisting for more than 3 years. The patient had no significant medical history and was seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). She had undergone vitrectomy of the right eye that was negative for malignant cells. DNA extracted from the vitreous fluid was negative for immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH) rearrangements, as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6 in the vitreous fluid were 51 pg/mL and 712 pg/mL, respectively. The IL-10/IL-6 ratio was <1.0, which was atypical for a diagnosis of vitreoretinal lymphoma.\\nOn admission to our hospital, the visual acuity of the right eye was almost lost. The fundoscopic image of the left eye obtained on admission is shown in Fig. 1A. An analysis after diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy of the left eye did not detect any malignant cells. DNA extracted from the vitreous fluid was negative for both IgH and T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements, as determined by PCR. These findings did not support that the uveitis occurred because of lymphoma. The concentrations of IL-10 and IL-6 were 53 pg/mL and 430 pg/mL, respectively. The ratio of IL10/IL6 of the left vitreous fluid was <1.0, similar to that in the right vitreous fluid, as indicated above. Screening for infectious diseases by quantitative multiplex PCR of the vitreous fluid DNA was performed for the detection of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, EBV, cytomegalovirus, human herpes viruses 6-8, Toxoplasma gondii, bacterial 16S, fungal 18S/28S, and mycobacterium tuberculosis, according to our previously described method. The PCR results were negative for all tested pathogens, except for EBV DNA, which was detected at 5.47x105 copies/mL. Her anti-EBV antibody titers were 1:80 for anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgG and 1:10 for anti-EB nuclear antigen (EBNA). Anti-VCA-IgM antibody was undetectable. An otolaryngological examination was negative for nasal lymphoma. EBV DNA was negative in the peripheral blood, and a systemic examination including the nasal cavity with 2-Deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (FDG-PET/CT) did not detect any lesions. We could not determine the diagnosis of lymphoma and injected subtenon triamcinolone acetonide into the left ocular lesion. However, this failed to improve her symptoms. In order to preserve her visual acuity, 400 mug methotrexate (MTX) weekly for 6 weeks, based on the treatment protocol for vitreoretinal lymphoma, was administered into the left vitreous following the approval of the Institutional Review Board. The treatment resulted in a dramatic improvement, and the patient achieved complete response (CR; Fig. 1B).\\nHowever, two years after the MTX treatment and four years after the onset of symptoms, the uveitis of the right eye rapidly progressed. Because of severe ocular pain and loss of visual acuity that was considered irreversible, the patient underwent enucleation of the right eye. A pathological examination revealed massive necrosis and the absence of lymphoma cells (data not sown). While the symptoms were resolved, the patient subsequently underwent both an ophthalmological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the head and neck.\\nTwo years and two months after enucleation, multiple hyperintense lesions were detected on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging MRI in the right occipital and parietal lobes and the precentral gyrus, and a left visual field defect was detected on an ophthalmological evaluation (Fig. 2). The tumor was suspected to be high-grade glioma and was removed by craniotomy; however, the pathological diagnosis was ENKL. As shown in Fig. 3, the infiltrating cells in the pathological specimen were positive for CD3, CD56, and TIA1. The tumor cells were positive for EBV. EBV DNA was negative in the peripheral blood. The DNA extracted from the right vitreous and brain lesions was amplified for the sequence analysis of LMP1, an EBV gene, to determine homology. The forward and reverse primers were 5'-GCT GTC GAC GCC ACC ATG GAA CAC GAC CTT GAG AGG-3' and 5'-GCT GGA TCC TTA GTC ATA GTA GCT TAG CTG AAC-3', respectively, and their nucleotide positions in EBV variant B95.8 (Genbank No. V01555) were 169474-169454 and 168160-168183, respectively. This lesion had sequence variations in each EBV. The conditions for the PCR reactions were as follows: 94 C for 2 minutes, 98 C for 10 seconds, 62 C for 30 seconds, and 68 C for 90 seconds for 40 cycles. The LMP1 sequence was confirmed after TA cloning with PCR products. As shown in Fig. 4, the repeat regions of LMP1 detected in the vitreous and brain lesion were identical. Based on the clinical, pathological, and genetic findings, the CNS lesion was confirmed to be closely associated with and most likely originated from the uveitis. The patient was treated with intravenous high-dose MTX at 3.5 g/m2, administered 3 times, and has since maintained CR for 24 months without recurrence.\",\n",

Examination of the patient was unremarkable with the exception of bilateral lower limb weakness. Computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed a large lobulated heterogeneous hyperdense lesion in the left posterior fossa. The lesion exerted a mass effect compressing the 4th ventricle and brainstem structures, with supratentorial triventricular hydrocephalus (Figure 1) accompanied by permeative bone reaction in the left occipital bone (Figure 2).\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed evidence of an infratentorial posterior fossa extra-axial mass that appeared to be dural. There was invasion of the marrow space of the left occipital bone (Figure 3(a)). In addition, heterogeneous signal intensity in T2-weighted images with multiple areas of central higher signal intensities representing necrosis was observed (Figure 3(b)). MRI with contrast enhancement showed the mass invading the inner skull table and intradiploic space (Figure 4).\\nDue to the primary malignancy, there was a significant mass effect over the left cerebellar hemisphere. The plane of cleavage between the tumor and the cerebellum was lost, indicating invasion. Furthermore, the tumor was noted to protrude through the foramen magnum, causing compression and displacement over the brainstem, especially over the upper medulla. Additional diagnostic testing with blood and imaging were found to be normal. The patient's tumor had destroyed the involved occipital bone, with minimal invasion of the dura and obvious calcification.\\nThe patient underwent a left parietooccipital craniotomy for tumor resection, with samples collected for histopathological evaluation. The gross specimen had a size of 5 x 4 x 2 cm3, grey color, irregular, firm consistency, without obvious necrosis or hemorrhage, and confirmed cerebellar invasion. From histopathology, the tumor sheets showed a compactly arranged round cell tumor with cells having clear cytoplasm. Small spicules of bone were also seen in the tumor tissue, suggestive of occipital bone destruction. It was noted that the cells were large with irregular nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli. The pleomorphic cells with few pseudorosettes were positive for EWS-FLI1 translocation in 98% of the cells. On immunohistochemistry, cells were immunoreactive for surface antigen CD99/MIC2 and positive for neuron-specific enolase and Leu 7.\\nPostoperative CT confirmed total tumor resection. The patient then received adjuvant chemotherapy with focal radiation. The patient was given vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by ifosfamide and etoposide plus radiation to the left cerebellopontine angle. After three cycles of chemotherapy, a subsequent MRI showed marginal response. The patient was then switched to another chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine, temozolomide, and irinotecan. The patient was lost to follow-up examination for eight-month duration after confirmation of remission. The patient then presented with severe constant lower back pain and urinary incontinence during the day. A whole-spine MRI showed intraspinal enhancing lesions representing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seeding, extending from the level L5-S4 (Figure 5). Palliative treatment including spinal radiation and ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) chemotherapy protocol was administered. The patient has been followed for six months to date, with disease stability from the palliative treatment.\",\n",

Past medical history was significant for HIV, anemia, and septoplasty. She was intubated on admission for airway protection due to concern for impending respiratory failure. On exam she was found to be febrile with Tmax of 39.9C, heart rate of 122 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 91/57 mmHg, saturating at 97% on 35% FiO2. Complete blood count revealed white blood cells of 3 x 103 cells/mL with 73% segs and 15% bands, hemoglobin of 4.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 17.7%, and platelets of 4,000 cells/mL. Ferritin was significantly elevated at 19,406 ng/mL and triglycerides were 412 mg/dL. HIV viral load was 1,842,730 copies/mL and CD4 count was 4 cells/mL. Physical exam revealed hepatosplenomegaly which was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound. The patient was diagnosed with HLH based on meeting the required five of eight criteria set forth in HLH-2004 guidelines (fever > 38.5C, splenomegaly, bicytopenia with hemoglobin < 9 g/dL and platelets < 100,000 cells/mL, triglycerides > 265 mg/dL, and ferritin > 500 ng/mL). The other three criteria (NK cell activity, CD25 level, and pathological evidence of hemophagocytosis) were not evaluated due to unavailability of labs and thrombocytopenia precluding bone marrow biopsy.\\nThe patient was placed on empirical antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin) for sepsis while investigation for infectious source was conducted. She was also started on methylprednisolone for respiratory failure at admission, which was continued for three days. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Sputum culture grew normal flora. Tests were negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii, acid fast bacilli, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis, syphilis, and influenza A. The only positive finding was antibody for influenza B, which was attributed to a mild upper respiratory infection that had resolved on its own with supportive measures two weeks prior to admission.\\nDespite aggressive transfusions, significant anemia and thrombocytopenia persisted. At this point, the most likely trigger of the HLH was determined to be an uncontrolled HIV infection. Given the patient's clinical instability and unresponsiveness to supportive treatment, ART was empirically initiated with tenofovir/emtricitabine, darunavir, and ritonavir. Within one week of initiation of ART, the patient improved clinically and was able to be extubated, and her laboratory parameters began to normalize (Figure 1). By the time the patient was discharged three weeks after ART initiation, hemoglobin had risen to 10.5 g/dL and platelets to 169,000 cells/mL.\",\n",

This pain started as a vague, mild generalized pain, then localized to the right iliac fossa and became severe and constant. She denied any change in her bowel motions. It was associated with nausea and recurrent episodes of nonprojectile food content vomiting for 3 days.\\nShe had a febrile sensation, has not been recorded, and a lack of appetite for the last 3 days, but there was no history of nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, cough, or chest pain. The patient did not report any contact with sick patients or recent travel to epidemic areas. The patient was previously healthy with no history of chronic medical conditions of relevance. She was afebrile and vitally stable. She had a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100 % on ambient air, a respiratory rate (RR) 17 breath per minute, a heart rate (HR) 72 beats per minute, and blood pressure 123/85 mmHg. The abdomen was not distended and soft, but there was tenderness and rebound tenderness at the right iliac fossa. There was no organomegaly. The examination of the chest and the other systems were normal. Her routine blood examination showed leukopenia with WBC 3000/muL, lymphopenia 800/muL, a microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin 9.6 g/dl (normal range 12-15), a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 62.6 fl (normal range 83-101), and platelet level was normal.\\nKidney and liver functions were normal, C-reactive protein 14.4 mg/l (normal range 0-5), and procalcitonin was normal. Pregnancy test was negative. Chest x ray was completely normal initially and after 3 days (Fig. 1).\\nBased on the history, physical examination and laboratory results, Alvarado score assessment for acute appendicitis was done (5/10) which supported the diagnosis of appendicitis. CT abdomen was ordered to rule out acute appendicitis. The image revealed that the appendix is normal, but there are bilateral patchy peripheral lung basal consolidations and ground-glass attenuations (Figs. 2 and 3 ). Given the current pandemic of COVID-19, the CT scan findings suggested the possibility of COVID-19. Therefore, nasal and throat swabs from the patients were tested for COVID-19.

She had a history of pulmonary embolism in 2007 for which she was on coumadin for a year. She had a biventricular pacemaker placed in 2008 for complete heart block induced nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Complete heart block was diagnosed at the same time and was believed to be secondary to myotonic dystrophy. The pacemaker device reached elective replacement indicator and was replaced with a Medtronic Protecta D314TRG device in 3/2012. She was on Tylenol 500 mg as needed for back pain, levocetirizine 5 mg twice daily for seasonal allergies, and rivaroxaban and zolpidem 5 mg nightly as needed. The above-listed medications do not have p-glycoprotein altering activity or CYP3A4/5 or CYP2J2 inhibiting activity.

Her height and weight were 1.7 m and 180 lbs, respectively. Cardiac examination was normal. Chest examination was significant for bibasilar rales. Electrocardiogram revealed ventricular paced rhythm. There was no associated electrical alternans. Lab tests revealed negative troponin, INR of 1.3, and PTT of 28 s. Complete blood count and basic metabolic profile were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) on chest showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed a large hyperdense pericardial effusion (Figure 1). Echocardiogram showed moderate-sized circumferential effusion with a swinging heart consistent with pericardial effusion (prior echo 4 years ago showed no pericardial effusion) (Figure 2). Inferior vena cava was dilated with no respiratory collapse and right ventricle outflow tract collapsed in diastole. With the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, emergency subxiphoid pericardial window was performed and a total of 300 mL of bloody pericardial fluid was drained. Hemostasis was achieved and was satisfactory. Transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed emptying of the collection as well as improved cardiac function. There was immediate improvement in her hemodynamic status. Postprocedure images showed complete resolution of the effusion. Further etiologic workup was unrevealing. Pericardial fluid culture was negative with normal cytology. Pericardial tissue biopsy was negative for malignancy. Thyroid and liver function tests were normal. ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-saccharomyces cerevisae antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, C3, C4, and anti-liver-kidney-muscle antibody were negative making the autoimmune cause unlikely. Myotonic dystrophy was considered to be an unlikely cause of her hemopericardium as pericardial involvement has not been reported with it. In addition, her previous echo was negative for pericardial effusion. There was no temporal relation to the axillary vein DVT and the pacemaker lead implantation as CT scan done in 2013 and echocardiogram done in 2015 mentioned a normal pericardium with appropriately implanted leads. Intraoperatively, there was no mention of pacemaker lead induced pericardial perforation. Further hospital course, unfortunately, was complicated by healthcare associated pneumonia with septic shock and multiorgan failure. The autopsy was not done.',\n",

She had two older healthy siblings and a brother who died at 12 days of age following an infection. The patient had an unremarkable perinatal course and was slowly meeting her developmental milestones. At four years, she developed fever, following which she lost the ability to walk independently and showed signs of developmental regression. At that time, she had her first episode of myoclonic seizures.\\nAt age six, the family emigrated to Canada. Within a year, the patient was wheelchair bound and had lost spontaneous speech. Ophthalmologic and hearing exams were normal. A neurological assessment identified microcephaly (<1 percentile), poor growth parameters (weight and height were at 5th percentile), and a pattern of spastic tetraparesis. MRI scan of the head showed generalized cerebral atrophy and ventriculomegaly with periventricular white matter volume loss (Figures 1 and 2). Electroencephalogram (EEG) confirmed frequent bitemporal epileptiform discharges.\\nChromosomal microarray analysis identified greater than 21% absence of heterozygosity (AOH) and no copy number variants (CNV). Rett gene (MECP2) testing was normal. Metabolic screening including plasma amino acids, acylcarnitine profile, total and free carnitine, plasma lactate, ammonia, urine organic acids, and urine mucopolysaccharide screen were negative. Negative results were received from genetic testing with a 201 leukodystrophy genes panel and mitochondrial DNA panel.\\nAt age nine, she was diagnosed with precocious puberty in addition to nonclassic, late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Cortical blindness was confirmed by an ophthalmological assessment. There were difficult to control seizures and her symptoms worsened. A request for funding of whole exome sequencing (WES) was declined on the administrative basis of the previous negative panels ordered less than three years prior.\\nAt 12 years of age, approval for a clinical WES was granted and the results identified two diagnoses. There was a homozygous pathogenic partial HERC2 gene deletion of exons 43-45 responsible for autosomal recessive HERC2-related disorder, which is characterized by intellectual disability, gait disturbance, seizures, hypotonia, and brain anomalies. This was recently described as a cause of pediatric lethality in a consanguineous population.\\nIn addition, a homozygous ACMG class 1 mutation (c.836 C> T, p.A279 V) in the SUMF1 gene was identified, which is responsible for autosomal recessive multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD). MSD is a lysosomal storage disorder that presents with developmental delay, regression, leukodystrophy, and coarse facial features. SUMF1 was not included in the initial leukodystrophy panel (Supplementary Material 1). The diagnosis of MSD was further confirmed biochemically by very low leukocyte arylsulfatase A activity (0.05 nmole/h/mg protein and low leukocyte arylsulfatase B activity 3 nmol//mg protein (same-day control 101 and 133). We were able to correlate the above changes to 21% AOH identified on her chromosomal microarray analysis. The AOH included 15q13.1, which harbors the HERC2 gene as well as the region 3p26.1 which carries the SUMF1 gene (Supplementary Material 2).\\nHer parents were identified to be carriers for those two conditions. Both parents and caregivers now have a better understanding of the cause and overall prognosis. The parents have presently accepted a referral to the palliative care team. The older siblings have also been made aware of the genetic findings and advised to seek prenatal counseling.',\n",

He had chronically recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding for 15 years, developed malignant lesions of the descending part of the duodenum, and then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in our hospital. The patient has lost 15 kg of weight since the onset in September 2020. Moreover, he had no notable family medical history.\\nThe patient was admitted to the local hospital on March 8, 2019, and operated on a partial enterectomy with a 150 cm intestine because the enteroscopy found bleeding in a part of the intestine. However, the patient was still under anemia after the operation (Figure 1). After then, the patient suffered from jaundice and incomplete ileus with the feeling of ventosity and nausea in October 2020. The local hospital implemented PTCD to improve jaundice and treat fasting, nasogastric drainage, and total parenteral nutrition for incomplete ileus. However, they did not find a solution to handle the bleeding event. Therefore, the patient came to our hospital for further medical consultation. Tracing the history, we found that the patient had anemia before he was 16 and was given blood transfusion therapy. This situation recurred 3-4 times before.\\nWe did regular pre-operation examinations after the patient was admitted to our hospital. Enhanced computer tomography showed dilatation of the duodenum and stomach, and there was a space-occupying lesion that tended to be malignant. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed duodenal malignancy, slight dilatation of the bile duct, and fatty liver (Figure 2). Obviously, the gastrointestinal obstruction was caused by the occupying lesion of the descending part of the duodenum.\\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple diffused polyps located in the stomach and the duodenum, and colonoscopy showed the same extent polyps of varying sizes localized in the rectosigmoid region. The onset of small intestinal malignant tumors combined with upper and lower gastrointestinal tract polyps might suggest MUTYH-associated polyposis syndrome (MAP) or Lynch syndrome. Nevertheless, further physical examination revealed that the patient had macrocephaly, and dermatologic examination was remarkable (Figure 3). Miliary papules were scattered on the face, especially on the forehead. Also, there was papilloma of the tongue, hyperkeratosis of soles, and melanosis spots on the glans of the penis. Therefore, we considered the possibility of other diseases such as Cowden syndrome and P-J syndrome and performed a radical pancreaticoduodenectomy (classic Whipple) to remove the malignant lesion in the duodenum on March 23, 2021.\\nThe gross pathology showed a 6 x 5 x 4 cm cauliflower-like protrusion lesion (Figure 2). The cut surface of the tumor was pale, soft, and fragile and visually infiltrated the muscular layer of the duodenum. Diffuse hyperplastic grayish-brown polyps could be seen in the entire intestinal wall, ranging from 1 to 4 mm. The common bile duct was dilated, and the pancreas was undisturbed. Microscopic pathology (Figure 4) reported that the cauliflower-like elevated tumor of the duodenum was considered a hamartomatous polyp, with malignancy in some areas (80% non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, 20% mucinous adenocarcinoma). Also, the carcinoma tissue had infiltrated into the subserous layer. Other polyps were described as polypoid hyperplasia of mucosal glands. No metastasis was observed in perigastric lymph nodes and peripancreatic lymph nodes. In addition, it is suggested that the mesentery nodules were hemangioma. Immunohistochemical results showed Ki-67(40% positive), CDX2(+), MSH2(+), MSH6(+), PMS2(+), CK20(+), STK11(+/-), PTEN(expression deletion), Her-2(weak +), SATB2(little +), D2-40(no apparent lymphatic tumor thrombus was found), and p52(DO7) (70%+); special staining showed no definite venous invasion of elastic fibers. Immunohistochemical results showed that PTEN protein expression was lost in the tumor and surrounding mucosal tissues, which may be an important factor in tumorigenesis. However, MLH1 and STK11 proteins were normally expressed. Therefore, we believed Cowden syndrome was the most likely diagnosis. At the suggestion of the pathologist, further NGS gene testing was carried out.\\nGene testing of the tissue samples suggested multiple germline gene mutations. A frameshift mutation was detected in the PTEN gene, leading to amino acid p.E242fs alternation. We refined the localization to position 89717695 of chr10, which might lead to a premature terminator in the new reading frame, resulting in protein dysfunction and having pathogenic significance. According to the large population databases (gnomAD, ExAC, 1,000 genome, ESP6500, etc.), this was a rare mutation that has never been discovered before. Partial genetic mutations of the PTEN gene are related to PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome/Cowden syndrome. This autosomal dominant genetic disease is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and thyroid disease and may increase the risk of endometrial cancer and central nervous system tumors. On chr13, missense mutation occurred in two-locus:32906558 and 142274875, causing P.C315S of the BRCA2 gene and p.T729A of ATR change. Missense mutations occurred in PALB2 and MC1R gene on chr16, causing p.Q1114R and p.A166G changes. All mutations of these germline genes were heterozygous mutants, and their clinical significance for CS has not been clarified except for PTEN. Four critical tumor driver gene mutations were detected in the patient. Tumor mutational burden was 2.20 muts/Mb, and microsatellite instability was detected as microsatellite stable. The mutation in exon 2 of KRAS changed P.G12A inactivated GTPase, leading to the accumulation of tumor-associated KRAS in the active GTP-bound conformation. That possibly promoted the development of malignant tumors. Currently, there are drugs targeting KRAS gene mutations in the market. Nevertheless, the detection of KRAS mutation also suggested that patients with colorectal cancer may be resistant to Cetuximab(A) and Panitumumab(A). These discoveries can be expected to guide the follow-up treatment. The other three mutations, resulting in p.R714H, p.A4083P, and p.D351G alternations, were detected in exon 11 of CREBBP, exon 48 of KMT2C, and exon 9 of SMAD4. However, the clinical significance of these mutant genes is unknown. PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining score is as follows: TC >= 1% and IC+:2%; the result was positive.\\nBased on that evidence, the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome is confirmed. Since there were no indications such as regional lymph node metastasis, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was not performed. The patient was followed up for 1 year, and there was no postoperative obstruction of bilioenteric anastomotic stenosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding did not recur, and the anemia had been corrected. Repeated reexamination of tumor markers did not suggest recurrence. All these suggest a good prognosis.',\n",

During the ERCP session, the patient became agitated, and the procedure was aborted after a simple sphincterotomy. A repeat session with the patient under general anesthesia was unsuccessful in removing the distal CBD stone (approximately 1 cm in size) because of the inability to manipulate and crash the stone. The following day, the patient underwent a laparoscopic exploration that had to be converted to open cholecystectomy due to the unclear anatomy. During the open procedure, the CBD was explored and 1 stone was extracted. The intraoperative cholangiogram revealed a retained stone in the distal CBD but flow of contrast in the duodenum (Figure 1). The patient was discharged with a T-tube in place. Seven weeks later, the patient presented with mild acute pancreatitis. The T-tube cholangiogram showed at least 1 stone impacted in the distal CBD (Figure 2). A percutaneous approach under fluoroscopy was at this point attempted, but it failed due to the inability to grasp the stone. A 16 Fr drain was left in the T-tube tract.\\nAt this point, the patient was taken to the operating room with the intention to perform EHL via the T-tube tract.\\nWith the patient under conscious sedation, 2 wires were inserted through the T-tube tract under fluoroscopic guidance. The retained stone was confirmed to be approximally 2 cm above the ampulla. A flexible cholangioscope was introduced over the guidewire. Basket extraction was again attempted under direct vision. With some manipulation, the stone was freed from the bile duct wall. Subsequently, a 3 Fr EHL probe was passed through the working channel of the choledochoscope. Utilizing 80 W current, adequate fragmentation of the stone was obtained. During the process of stone fragment extraction, the patient became agitated and hypoxic with signs of pulmonary edema and hence endotracheally intubated. A few more fragments were removed, and a cholangiogram revealed contrast flowing into the duodenum (Figure 3).\\nThe patient was kept intubated overnight.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast showed a saddle embolus with multiple bilateral, central, and peripheral pulmonary emboli. She was diagnosed with acute, unprovoked PE. Hypotension requiring monitoring by the intensive care unit complicated her hospital course. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, moderately dilated right ventricle (RV), and mildly reduced RV function. Right ventricular systolic pressure was 40-45 mm Hg. Bilateral doppler ultrasound of lower limbs revealed bilateral DVTs. She received anticoagulation therapy and, due to the high risk of further PEs in the future, an interventional radiologist deployed an infrarenal vena cava filter (G-2 recovery retrievable filter). Six months later, a repeated CT scan of the chest with IV contrast showed an almost complete resolution of the PE. However, the patient remained on chronic oral anticoagulation and there was no discussion of retrieving the IVC filter.\\nIn 9/2010, the patient presented to the internal medicine clinic with left sided pleuritic chest pain. Unchanged electrocardiogram and negative cardiac biomarkers ruled out acute coronary syndrome. Chest CT scan with IV contrast showed a high-density linear structure extending into the superior segmental and superior lingular segmental pulmonary artery branches and the left lower lobe (Fig. 1). This most likely represented a broken IVC filter strut. A chest x-ray shows the same finding (Fig. 2). Abdominal CT scan with IV contrast revealed the infrarenal IVC filter with missing struts. Fig. 3 shows a comparison between two abdominal CTs. The CT scan taken in 12/2008 shows the IVC filter with 12 struts while the CT taken in 9/2010 shows only 11 struts. The patient was diagnosed with stable chronic angina pectoris and her chest pain improved with nitroglycerine. As the displacement was asymptomatic and the removal procedure holds risk of complications, a multidisciplinary team chose a conservative approach and left the IVC filter strut and the original IVC filter in place. The patient was managed with chronic oral anticoagulation. Over the next 4 years the patient's symptoms were monitored through regular clinic follow ups and serial chest CT scans. As of 2/2014, the patient remained asymptomatic and there was no evidence of any complications, including changes in the position of the fractured and migratory strut.\",\n",

She had had a cholecystectomy 30 years ago; later on, without significant illness in medical history, she was a teetotaler and she smoked 2 cigarettes per day during 10 years but stopped completely during the 6 last months. Routine blood tests were in the normal range. Abdominal ultrasound did not visualize the pancreas well due to bloating. A CAT scan was performed, finding multiple calcifications and irregularly dilated main pancreatic duct, predominantly in the pancreatic head (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)), where the dilatation had some cystic aspect and was disproportionally more pronounced than in the pancreatic body and tail. The same alterations were confirmed by MRI (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)), without intramural nodules in the dilated main duct. Based on the two imaging methods, we could not distinguish between chronic calcifying pancreatitis and mucin-producing neoplasia, that is, main duct IPMN. ERCP was performed, and contrast injection revealed a cystic dilation of main pancreatic duct in the head (Figure 2(a)). The duct of Wirsung was less dilated in the body. Through pancreatic papillotomy, typical whitish pancreatic stone passed into the duodenal lumen (Figure 2(b)). However, after having continued the contrast injection, mucin passage was seen producing the typical fish eye appearance in the major and also the minor papilla (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). Simultaneous existence of CP with pancreatic stones and main duct IPMN was our final diagnosis. Given the high probability of malignancy in the dominant cystic lesion, surgery was decided and performed. Surgery revealed a cystic tumor that was found in a fibrotic pancreas. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed with preservation of pylorus and pancreaticogastrostomy. Some whitish pancreatic stones were extracted. No lymph node metastasis was seen. Histological (Figure 3) findings confirmed the existence of a mucinous tumor emerging from the main pancreatic duct, with multiple foci of high grade dysplasia and even with evident transformation into an infiltrative malignant lesion (Figure 3). No lymph node metastasis or vascular involvement was found. Fibrosis, acinar cell degeneration, and tubular complexes were seen in the surrounding tumor-free pancreatic tissue.

Though the guru instructed her to practice meditation in her free time for a limited duration (20 minutes twice per day), she gradually increased time spent on meditation from initial one hour to 14-18 hours. Later, she would watch videos related to meditation on television and Internet for the rest of her day. When asked, she told that she felt very much relaxed and felt a sense of detachment from her body and a great sense of pleasure when she meditated. Hence, she increased her time spent on meditation. When enquired about her mumbling behaviour, she told that she was talking to her guru whose voice she could only hear.

       "    'case_text': 'A 41-year-old male presented to the emergency department of a regional Australian hospital with sudden onset severe chest and abdominal pain. On arrival, the patient was haemodynamically stable, but became rapidly unresponsive with oxygen saturations of 85%, tachycardia to 140 beats per minute, unrecordable blood pressure, and a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 (eyes 3 points, voice 1 point, and motor 4 points). Bedside, ultrasound scan yielded intra-abdominal free fluid in the left upper quadrant. The patient was resuscitated sufficiently to allow prompt computerized tomography (CT) angiogram. He had no history of trauma, falls, pancreatitis, or known hypertensive crisis, and no knowledge of any previous aneurysms.\\nCT angiogram demonstrated a large left upper quadrant intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal haematoma with dense peritoneal free fluid consistent with hemoperitoneum (Figure 1). A splenic artery aneurysm at least 28 mm x 16 mm was seen with active contrast extravasation (Figure 2).\\nIn our regional centre, there are no interventional radiology or endovascular services available; hence, the patient underwent emergency laparotomy where a 2 L hemoperitoneum was evacuated. The bleeding splenic artery aneurysm was approached via division of the gastro colic omentum and reflection of the stomach superiorly to allow exposure of the lesser sac. This allowed adequate visualisation of the length of the splenic artery and the ruptured aneurysm mid-way along the artery was easily seen. Following this exposure, control of the splenic artery vessel at two points was achieved via suture ligation: the splenic artery proximal to the aneurysmal sac and distal to the aneurysmal sac were both secured, resulting in ligation of the artery at these two points. This was sufficient to achieve haemostasis. Due to the exposure technique via division of the gastro colic omentum, the short gastric and left gastro epiploic arteries were undisturbed and left intact allowing collateral circulation to the spleen to persist despite ligation of the splenic artery. Perfusion to the spleen appeared preserved and splenectomy was not required to be performed.\\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively for monitoring and made an unremarkable recovery. A surgical drain placed into the left upper quadrant of the abdomen at the time of operation had minimal output with no evidence of ongoing bleeding and was able to be removed day 2 postoperatively. On post-operative day 3, the patient remained very well and was fit for discharge home after an ultrasound scan confirmed continuing splenic perfusion and organ viability, though noted some surrounding residual haematoma. Three weeks postoperatively, the patient remained well and underwent surveillance CT angiogram, which confirmed ongoing sufficient collateral perfusion of the spleen and viability of the organ, with a resolving peri-splenic haematoma also seen (Figure 3). The differential diagnosis for the cause of the peri-splenic haematoma includes inadequate evacuation of haematoma at time of operation, iatrogenic damage to collateral vessels resulting in minor bleeding postoperatively, or inadequate control of the splenic artery. The post-operative drain had minimal output and the haematoma was reduced in size on repeat imaging; therefore, inadequate evacuation of an already formed clot from the time of operation is the most likely cause. At review 6 months post-procedure, the patient remained well with no latent complications.',\n",

His family history was significant for stroke and diabetes in multiple family members. He was on atorvastatin for dyslipidemia. He had no history of connective tissue or autoimmune disease. He was diagnosed with acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident and was given tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The patient received a single dose of atorvastatin 80 mg and aspirin 325 mg orally during the admission; he never received clopidogrel or ticlopidine therapy. The symptoms improved gradually, but he developed thrombocytopenia that worsened over the next few days. The team discontinued statin and aspirin therapy once they observed low platelets. The patient was managed conservatively, but his platelet counts reached a nadir at 16,000 per cubic mm. His peripheral blood smear showed no schistocytes in high-power fields. He was given a platelet transfusion with no improvement. He was then transferred to our hospital, and the inpatient hematology team was consulted. At the time of presentation, the patient complained of clumsiness in his left arm, although he was able to carry out daily activities with minimal difficulty. He was stable, the facial droop had resolved and speech slightly improved with residual dysarthria and expressive aphasia, and his motor power was better. A review of outside laboratory results revealed that 2 days before his transfer, his platelet count was 115,000 per cubic mm, BUN was 16, and his creatinine was 1.3. His initial lab values on arrival at our hospital were as follows: platelets 26,000 cells per cubic mm, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.7 g/dl, hematocrit (Hct) 31.2/L, leucocytes 16,300 cells per cubic mm, blood urea nitrogen 35, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 27, lactic acid dehydrogenase of 794 (98-192), bilirubin 0.9, and reticulocyte count 2.8. During admission, B12 and folic acid levels, antiphospholipid panel, disseminated intravascular coagulation panel, coagulation panel, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were measured and found to be within normal limits. HIV, hepatitis B, and direct Coombs tests were negative. However, his peripheral blood smear showed 5-6 schistocytes/high-power field. Neither the patient nor his family members underwent any screening for connective tissue or autoimmune disorders.\\nThe patient was immediately started on a daily total plasma exchange (TPE). On day 3, his neurological symptoms improved significantly, and his platelet count normalized to 167,000 per cubic mm. Despite the improved platelet count, TPE was continued for 2 more days. By day 5, his speech was clear and his expressive aphasia resolved. He recovered full strength in his right extremities and TPE was stopped. Blood samples were sent to the Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, for measurement of ADAMTS13 levels, and we got the results 5 days later. ADAMTS13 activity measured using FRETS-VWF73 substrate was <5% (reference range >=67%). ADAMTS13 inhibitor was measured using mixing studies with standard pooled plasma, and residual ADAMTS13 activity measured using FRETS-VWF73 substrate was <0.4 inhibitor units (reference range <=0.4). Platelet count remained stable throughout the patient's stay. At the time of discharge, his counts and Hb/Hct remained stable, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 249, and no schistocytes were present in peripheral blood smears. Because of his atypical presentation of TTP, he was advised to seek medical attention immediately if his neurological symptoms worsen to evaluate TTP relapse. After discharge, he was evaluated twice weekly with a CBC and LDH measurements after discharge for 2 weeks and once a week afterward. Higher levels of LDH were noticed subsequently normalized in 2 months. He complained of intermittent left facial numbness and tingling of the left hand during follow-up visits. The patient remained in remission without a relapse for 2 years after his initial presentation.\",\n",

Her severe sciatalgia had exacerbated since 6 months before admission. The diagnosis of L5/S1 disc herniation compressing S1 root on the left side was made and she underwent operation. It was a no-contrast standard lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At operation, L5 and partial S1 laminectomy followed by bilateral S1 foraminotomy, and bilateral L5/S1 discectomy was performed. Two weeks after the operation, the patient's symptoms exacerbated and paresthesia appeared in the left buttock. Paresthesia of the perineal region and urinary incontinency were also added to her previous complaints. On admission to our department, the muscle forces of the lower limb were intact both proximally and distally, but pin prick sensation was disturbed in S1, S2, and S3 dermatomes, and Achilles tendon reflex was absent in the left side. However, anal sphincter tone was intact. Re-evaluation of the previous preoperative lumbosacral MRI revealed that in addition to the L5/S1 bulged disc, there was an extradural dorsally located mass at S1, S2, and S3 levels. The new contrast-enhanced MRI revealed a 3 x 2 x 2 cm extradurally located tumor, extending from lower edge of S1 down to S2/S3 interspace. The tumor was hypointense in both T1 and T2 images and enhanced homogenously after contrast material injection. Scalloping of the posterior aspect of the S2 vertebra was also detectable [Figure 1a-d]. In the second operation, the previous laminectomy was extended from lower edge of L5 down to S3. A reddish gray tumor located in the extradural space, extending from S1 root axilla down to the S3 root, could be excised totally. There was neither tumor invasion to the dura or intradural space, nor any bone involvement detectable under microscopic observation. Histopathologic examination revealed a highly cellular neoplasm composed of diffuse sheets of tumor cells having monomorphic, round to oval, finely vesicular nuclei and occasional nucleoli with indistinct cytoplasmic border. Delicate fibrovascular septae surrounded the tumor mass along with intra tumoral extensions. In some foci, tumor cells gathered in groups around small vessels (pseudo-rosette appearance). There were nerve bundle entrapments within the tumor nests. Several groups of mitotic figures were noted, but no necrosis was detected [Figure 2a and b].\\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed that the tumor cells stained positively for neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, and chromogranin, suggestive of neuronal differentiation of the tumor. Tumor cells also expressed CD99, consistent with the diagnosis of ES/PNET [Figure 2c]. Ki-67 proliferative index showed about 10-15% proliferative activity. Other markers such as leukocyte common antigen (LCA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CK), desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and myogenin were negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosomal study were not performed.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful and all her symptoms including radicular pain and sphincter problems improved rapidly. The patient was referred for radiotherapy as the adjuvant therapy. In the last re-evaluation of the patient after 18 months, there was no sign of tumor recurrence in MRI.\\nAfter our wide search using Tehran University of Medical Sciences electronic resources (www.tums.ac.ir) and motor searches of Pubmed, Ovid, and EBSCO using the key words, spinal primitive neuroectodermal tumor and spinal extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma, 106 abstracts were found in the form of case series and case reports, which reported 141 cases of primary intraspinal EES/pPNET. Full texts of all the articles were collected from different electronic and paper archives including English, French, Spanish, and Italian articles. The earliest articles were published by Smith et al. and Tefft et al. in 1969 and the latest by Gollard et al. in Feb 2011. Patients' information including age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms, duration of symptoms, family history, location of the tumor, metastasis, recurrences, therapeutic methods, duration of follow-up, and eventual outcome were all extracted from resources. As the articles were reported from various clinical departments (e.g. Neurosurgery, Orthopedics, Radiology, Oncology, Pathology, Pediatrics), different aspects of the disease were reviewed in each, and this led to neglecting some other aspects resulting in missed values regarding some subjects. In some of them with missing data about the mode of therapy, final outcome, or follow-up of the patients, the authors were contacted via e-mail directly for the required information. In spite of sending e-mail to 20 authors, only one reply was received.\\nAfter collecting and classifying the information, the data were analyzed utilizing SPSS version 13.0.\\nFor analysis of the numeric variables such as age, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate normal distribution of the data upon which we could decide to utilize parametric versus non-parametric tests to compare the data. Chi-square test (chi2) was used when comparing two nominal or ordinal variables such as 1-year survival in patients receiving different therapies. Independent sample t-test was used to evaluate numerical variable among two populations (e.g. age in different subgroups). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\",\n",

The patient met all indication criteria, apart from an exceedingly high fixed pulmonary hypertension. A biventricular pulsatile assist device (Thoratec PVAD, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) was implanted in a biventricular fashion in order to reduce the pulmonary resistance to measures matching the criteria for subsequent heart transplantation. Anticoagulation therapy, required due to the implanted mechanical circulatory support (MCS), was established with warfarin (INR 2.0-2.5). The patient's previously deteriorated renal function improved after biventricular assist device implantation (serum creatinine 1.87 mg/dL   0.97 mg/dL and GFR 29 mL/min   62 mL/min). Thirty-five days after surgery, the patient complained of a sudden onset of severe headache and coma rapidly developed. Despite a moderate level of anticoagulation at the time of the event (INR 2.1), CT scan verified a vast haemorrhagic stroke in the left cerebral hemisphere with propagation to the cerebral ventricular system and malignant brain oedema. In view of the lethal neurological prognosis, organ donation was taken into consideration, as the patient had a relatively well-preserved function of other organs because of adequate circulatory perfusion. Having received negative brain perfusion at the angiography, after laparatomy and perfusion with 2000 mL of UW solution, a bilateral transabdominal nephrectomy was performed and the kidneys were shown to be suitable for transplantation. The MCS was maintained for the duration of the kidney procurement and thus the procedure was performed under the same conditions as a normal beating heart. At that time, the patient's kidney function was satisfactory (Cr 0.97 mg/dL, GFR 62 mL/min).

In the long term, this method diminishes the adverse processes connected with low cardiac output syndrome, by restoring adequate systemic and organ perfusion and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance.\\nRecently, an extended donor criteria pool program has been widely used in both the United States and Europe to solve the progressive disparity between the increasing number of patients waiting for kidney transplantation and a limited donor pool. The use of more and more marginal donors for kidney transplantation and transplantation from donors after cardiac death has often failed to give optimal results in the long term. An MCS device which mediates well-perfused organs in deceased donors might be considered as acceptable for transplantation in the context of an organ shortage. In contrast to successful kidney recovery in a donor after cardiac death, treated previously with a left ventricular assist device, we here present a satisfactory 1-year follow-up of kidneys transplanted from a brain-dead heart transplant candidate, treated during the kidney removal with a biventricular assist device. Because of the increasing usage of mechanical circulatory support in the treatment of terminal heart failure with the risk of fatal complications, we encourage transplant professionals to consider such donors to be suitable for kidney donation.',\n",

The cat lived in southwest France but had spent several months in the Central African Republic when it was 1 year old. The cat had access to the outdoors, and its owner reported regular fights with other cats. About 18 months previously, the cat had been diagnosed with idiopathic immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (IMHA/IMT) but had been relatively stable for the past 10 months on oral ciclosporin (Atopica chat 100 mg/ml; Elanco) at a dosage of 7.4 mg/kg q24h and oral prednisolone (Prednicortone 20 mg; Dechra) at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg q48h. The cat had recently developed one nodule on the lateral carpal of the right foreleg. The lesion was 7 mm in diameter, cutaneous to subcutaneous, pigmented, soft, haired, non-painful and non-productive (Figure 1). This lesion was reported to have grown slowly, without disturbing the cat. No other dermatological or clinical abnormalities were observed.\\nThe history (immunocompromised cat with access to the outdoors) and clinical features were most consistent with the hypotheses of a cutaneous/subcutaneous infection (pseudomycetoma, leprosy syndrome, other opportunistic mycobacteria, phaeohyphomycosis, hyalohyphomycosis, eumycotic mycetoma, cryptococcosis, sporotrichosis, poxvirus infection, leishmaniosis), neoplasms (melanoma, haemangioma, feline progressive histiocytosis, mastocytoma) and, less likely, sterile granuloma.\\nFine-needle aspirates were taken from the nodule, and smears were May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained. Cytological examination revealed damaged inflammatory cells suggestive of neutrophils and the presence of multiple pigmented fungal elements, leading to a diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis without precise identification of the fungal species involved (Figure 2).\\nSurgical excision was proposed as part of the therapeutic regimen, and also to provide material for histological examination and mycological culture, and was accepted by the owner. On the day of the surgery, 1 month after the initial presentation, the nodule was slightly larger (approximately 1 cm in diameter), and a pigmented plaque-like lesion had appeared between the eyes (Figure 3). Complete excision of the limb nodule and a 4 mm punch biopsy of the plaque were performed under general anaesthesia. Oral itraconazole (Itrafungol; Virbac) at a dosage of 10 mg/kg q24h was started on the same day.\\nMicroscopic appearance was similar for both lesions and was characterised by diffuse, superficial and deep dermal (Figure 4a,b) histiocytic, lymphocytic and, to a lesser extent, neutrophilic infiltrate, with numerous spherical elements, measuring 3-20 microm in diameter, often isolated or with narrow-based buds, surrounded by a basophilic capsule (Figure 4c). Periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed that the elements were positive (Figure 4d). The margins of the nodule appeared to be free of fungal elements.\\nThe fungus was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates complemented with 0.5 g/l chloramphenicol for 11 days at 27 C and 37 C and yielded colonies of a black yeast-like fungus (Figure 5). The fungus was identified through macroscopic and microscopic observations, confirmed by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry) and molecular biology. Mass spectra were acquired after complete protein extraction using a Microflex LT/HS (Bruker Daltonik) and matched against the online application MSI-2 (https://msi.happy-dev.fr). The species E spinifera was identified by mass spectrometry. Confirmation was obtained using Sanger DNA sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions. The DNA sequence was compared with sequences in the NCBI GenBank database using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. The best match (99.8% identity) was with E spinifera, strain CNRMA6.306 (GenBank accession number KP132129.1). The sequences have been deposited in Genbank (accession number OQ466703).\\nTo investigate the antifungal susceptibility of the isolate, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were identified using the concentration gradient band (E-test; Biomerieux). The tests showed sensitivity to voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B (MIC 0.023 microg/ml, 0.008 microg/ml, 0.006 microg/ml and 0.19 microg/ml, respectively) and resistance to fluconazole (MIC 24 microg/ml). Based on these results, itraconazole was maintained.\\nAt the 8-week follow-up evaluation, the excisional wound had completely healed and no relapse was visible. Clinical resolution of the non-excised facial lesion was observed. Itraconazole was continued for six more weeks and stopped. Immunosuppressive therapy (ciclosporin and prednisolone) was continued to prevent relapse of IMHA/IMT.',\n",

A 24-year male who was a prospective liver donor for his mother was referred to us for percutaneous LB. The indication of LB was a suspicion of parenchymal liver disease, as suggested by the widening of inter-lobar fissure of liver on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination [Figure 1A and B], which also showed normal portal veins [Figure 2A and B]. Ultrasound-guided plugged liver biopsy was planned under local anesthesia. Baseline platelet count was 389 x 109/L, hemoglobin level was 14.3 mg/dl, and prothrombin time and INR were 13.0 s and 1.01, respectively. Local anesthesia was administered by infiltration of 10 ml of 2% xylocaine hydrochloride. A Quick-core biopsy needle set (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA) containing coaxial needle (16 Gauge, 12 cm long) and core biopsy needle (18 Gauge, 15 cm long with 2 cm specimen notch) was used to obtain tissue core. The coaxial needle was inserted from the right intercostal approach. Through the coaxial needle, the biopsy needle was inserted and a single tissue core was obtained. The biopsy needle was removed while the coaxial needle was left in place. This was followed by the injection of gelfoam (Spongostan standard, Ferrosan, Denmark) slurry through the coaxial needle to plug the parenchymal track under real-time ultrasound guidance. Post biopsy, the patient was asked to lie on his right side for approximately 4 h. Later, the patient was discharged after a routine screening ultrasonography, which was unremarkable. Two weeks later, the patient presented with mild right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed echogenic thrombus completely occluding the right portal vein [Figure 3A]. Contrast-enhanced CT scan of upper abdomen confirmed right portal vein occlusion [Figure 3B and C]. The patient was started on oral antiplatelets and anticoagulants for 1 week, however, there was no resolution of the thrombus on repeat ultrasound and Doppler scan. Because the donor was symptomatic with thrombus in subacute stage, percutaneous endovascular intervention appeared to be the best option for his treatment.\\nUnder ultrasound guidance, percutaneous puncture of the left portal vein was done using a 22-gauge micropuncture needle. Using NEFF set (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA), a 0.035\" J tip guide wire was introduced into the portal vein and exchanged for a 5F KMP catheter (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA).

She entered a follow-up program that was negative until September 2007, when a restaging computed tomography (CT) scan identified disease recurrence at the left popliteal and iliac metastatic lymph nodes, with normal Lactate Dehydrogenase levels. In October 2007, the patient was evaluated at our Center for Immuno-Oncology at the University Hospital of Siena, Italy, for enrollment in a randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial (BMS CA184024), comparing ipilimumab 10 mgs i.v. combined with dacarbazine (DTIC) 850 mg/mq i.v. versus DTIC alone, in untreated MM patients. Due to evidence of autoimmune thyroiditis, the patient did not meet the study protocol eligibility criteria and received DTIC 800 mg/mq i.v. every 3 weeks in combination with Thymosin-alpha (4 cycles), within an Expanded Access Program (EAP).\\nIn April 2008, due to evidence of progressive disease (PD) of the pre-existing metastatic lesions, the patient was enrolled in the randomized, open-label, Phase II, BMS CA186-006 (NCT00612664) clinical trial and received the CD137 agonist mAb, urelumab, at 1 mg/kg i.v. every 3 weeks (10 cycles) until November 2008, without treatment-related side effects. Nevertheless, treatment had to be discontinued for the premature study closure due to two fatal cases of drug-related hepatic toxicity. Despite early treatment discontinuation, the patient achieved complete response (CR) in May 2009, 6 months after the last dose of urelumab, as shown by a CT scan (Figure 1). Importantly, she remained in CR for more than 4 years.\\nIn December 2013, a control [18F] fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan revealed a right inguinal metastatic lymph node and a left thigh subcutaneous metastatic lesion; thus, the patient received standard third-line therapy with ipilimumab (3 mgs) i.v. every 3 weeks (4 doses). Therapy was well tolerated, except for a treatment-related (TR)-grade (G) 2 skin toxicity and TRG2 diarrhea, treated with symptomatic therapy and low dose steroids (ie, prednisone 25 mg/die) for 3 weeks, slowly tapered with rapid improvement of side effects. Tumor assessment (TA) performed by FDG-PET scan at week 12 showed a mixed response consisting of a partial regression of the right inguinal node and a progression of the left thigh subcutaneous lesion. Thus, the patient had achieved stable disease (SD) as per immune-related Response Criteria (irRC) and PD as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1 (Figure 2). However, the subsequent TA at week 24, confirmed PD according to RECIST v. 1.1 and irRC criteria (data not shown).\\nBased on the confirmed PD, in October 2014 the patient received fourth-line therapy with the anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab (2 mgs) i.v. every 3 weeks within an EAP, achieving a new CR at week 24 of therapy (Figure 3). Treatment was well tolerated with evidence of TRG1 arthralgia and TRG1 fatigue after the 4th cycle and TRG1 diarrhea after the 10th cycle, which resolved with symptomatic therapy.\\nIn August 2017, due to the durable CR and to the patient's desire, treatment with pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued. The last FDG-PET scan performed in December 2022 confirmed CR lasting 91+ months.\",\n",

He was admitted to hospital with cough and hemoptysis for more than five months.\\nAdmission blood tests showed a white cell count of 5.8 x 109/L, C-reactive protein 3.1 mg/L and interleukin-6 16.32pg/mL. All of sputum smear acid-fast staining, tuberculin test and tuberculosis antibody test were negative. Serum biomarkers of lung cancer, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Cytokeratin-19-fragment (CYFRA21-1), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were negative.\\nThe images of computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed large dense shadows and cavity formation in the inferior lobe of the left lung (Figure 1A). The electronic bronchoscopy showed a big and white neoplasm in the lower left lung, with a narrow opening and a lot of white necrotic material in the subsegment (Figure 2).

One week later when we got the result of mNGS, etimicin (300mg one time daily) was used in combination to enhance treatment against Gram-negative bacteria. Another two weeks later, the symptom of diarrhea in the patient was considered to be due to the imbalance of intestinal flora induced by long-term extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Therefore, the anti-infective treatment regimen was reduced to etimicin only. The patient was hospitalized for one month. The results of CT re-examination suggested that the area of infection in the inferior lobe of the left lung was significantly reduced, and the cavity was smaller (Figure 1B). After he was discharged from hospital, he was treated with oral levofloxacin (0.5g once daily) for four months. The condition of the lung was further improved than before (Figure 1C).',\n",

He reported no history of trauma, infection, or prior surgery of the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a well-defined mass located deeply in the outer edge of the middle humerus muscle, but at the focal border, it had protruded into the surrounding muscle. The signal intensity was slightly enhanced on T1-weighted imaging (Figure 1A) and marked heterogeneous enhancement on T2-weighted imaging (Figure 1B). The MRI findings suggested the possibility of fibromatosis. The patient underwent surgery for mass excision. On gross examination, it was an irregular, solitary mass measuring 5.0 cm x 4.0 cm x 4.0 cm, in the muscle with a grayish-white cut surface.\\nMicroscopic examination showed that the tumor was relatively well demarcated, but in the focal, it was infiltrating the adherent muscle (Figure 2A). It was highly cellular and composed of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts arranged in bundles with an interlaced pattern (Figure 2B). Part of the lesion was discohesive and myxoid with a microcystic appearance (Figure 2C). Some tumor cells had mild atypia with active mitotic counts (the average mitotic counts up to 8 per 10 high-power fields, Figure 2D) and mingled conspicuous multinuclear or atypical giant cells (Figure 2E). Erythrocyte extravasation was easily seen on a background of collagenous stroma (Figure 2F), with some hemosiderin deposition and scattered lymphoplasmacytic cells infiltration.\\nImunohistochemical detection, The tumor cells were only positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 3A), negative for cytokeratin, desmin, H-Caldesmon (see supplement data), CD34, S100, ALK, and beta-catenin. The multinuclear giant cells were positive for CD68 (Figure 3B)). The average rate of ki67 positivity was 10% (Figure 3C). According to histopathological and immunohistochemical studies, fibromatosis was first excluded for the tumor's growth pattern and beta-catenin negative. Leiomyosarcoma was ruled out as well for H-Caldesmon and desmin negative. However, it was still difficult to distinguish the tumor from a (myo) fibroblastic sarcoma.\\nMolecular detection was performed on 4 mum paraffin-embedded tumor section by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) using a USP6 dual-color break-apart probe (Guangzhou LBP Medicine Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China). The FISH results revealed evidence of USP6 gene rearrangement given the division of green and red signals (Figure 3D). The average percentage of USP6 split signals was 40%. Molecular findings confirmed the diagnosis of intramuscular NF. At 56 months after surgery, the patient recovered well with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis by the imaging examination.\",\n",

The ADM employed was ready-to-use AlloDerm (Life Cell Corporation, Branchburg, New Jersey). \\nOn post-operative day 18, the patient developed bilateral breast seromas, requiring needle aspiration using an 18-gauge IV catheter. Mild erythema was noted at this time and a ten-day course of oral levaquin was started. Aspiration was performed again on the right side two days later. Both seroma cultures grew Mucor (zygomycetes) colonies (few colonies). Oral voriconazole 200 mg every 12 hours was started per infectious disease recommendations. Tight glycemic control (<180) was maintained with close follow-up by her endocrinoloist.\\nOn post-operative day 23, dehiscence was noted at the apex of her vertical incision abutting the areola with an area of skin necrosis from mastectomy skin flap ischemia (Figure 1 and 2). The patient was afebrile and exhibited no signs of sepsis. Debridement of the skin and closure of the wound was performed, preserving the tissue expander and ADM. The ADM was intact without expander exposure. There was no purulence or necrosis of tissue deep to the dermis at the site of dehiscence. Subcutaneous tissue and fluid cultures were positive for Mucor (moderate count). Antifungal therapy was switched to posaconazole 800 mg per oral per day. \\nAt the time of her drain removal from this second surgery, biofilm strands from the drain site also grew two colonies of Mucor. She required repeat seroma aspiration one week later, and this time the culture was negative. On week later, repeat seroma aspiration grew out skin flora, and this aspiration was followed one day later with abrupt onset of right breast cellulitis which was successfully treated with two weeks of IV ertapenem and vancomycin. She required additional right breast seroma aspirations, two more times over the next 3 weeks. \\nThe first culture was no growth and second one was positive for skin flora. All aspirations revealed cloudy seroansguinous seroma content, never frankly purulent. Her recurrent seromas resolved, but three months later, her right breast cellulitis recurred, which again responded to IV antibiotics, this time with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Thereafter, her healing became uneventful and her tissue expansion was competed to 700 mL bilaterally. \\nShe completed a one-year course of antifungal under the surveillance of infectious disease consultants, which included close monitoring of liver function tests.

The anatomo-pathological examination concluded of an adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas pT2N+. An adjuvant chemotherapy by Gemsar and 5-FU is introduced but stopped precociously (3 courses) due to a bad tolerance.\\nThe patient showed a first episode of hematemesis with hemorrhagic shock requiring a hospitalization for 48 h in surgery intensive care (transfusion of three corpuscular caps). Oeso-gastro-duodenal fibroscopy shows three ulcerations on the set-in ileac efferent loop without any hemorrhagic sign, treated by endoscopy. Ten days later a 2nd episode of high digestive haemorrhage, with a state of shock, occurred. The patient was hospitalized for etiological research and monitoring. Two oesogastro-duodenal fiberscopies, followed by a colonoscopy and a video capsule endoscopy did not help to identify the origin of the bleeding. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography with high opacification did not find any active arterial bleeding, neither any pseudo-aneurism of the different branches coming from the celiac trunk (particularly from the gastroduodenal artery stump). It was not found apparent leaks of the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis.\\nThe occurrence 33 days later after the 1st episode, of a 3rd episode of high digestive hemorrhage combined with faintness and a melena required the carrying out in emergency of an abdominal CT angiography. This showed a pneumoperitoneum of average abundance without any apparent sign of leak. With a stable clinical state, an abdomen tenderness, and because of a surgery made complex by the CPD previous history, without possible detecting of the perforation on abdominal CT scan, a medical treatment with nasogastric tube, proton-pump-inhibitor (PPI) intravenous and antibiotherapy was introduced. After 24 h, the patient was transferred to digestive surgery due to the aggravation of the abdominal pain combined with a light muscular defense. Abdominal CT scan with ingestion of contrast product did not show any leaking of the contrast product. The patient was conscious without any sign of hemodynamic choc, the abdomen was painful with a severe pain on the right hypochondrium combined with a light muscular defense. Biology did not show any signs of cardiovascular decompensation (level of hemoglobin = 8,8 g/dl), nor of hemostasis disorder. An exploratory laparotomy was done due this clinical condition. Surgical exploration showed a chronic sinus between the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis and the left hemi-liver. The sinus was 1 cm of length; We noted there, an active bleeding of the gastroduodenal artery stump covered by the left hemi-liver (Fig. 1). A perfect hemostasis of the gastro-duodenal artery stump is carried out by a double ligation with Prolen 5/0. A pancreatic cutting is carried out at the level of the fistula, followed by a repairing of the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis on a solid pancreas and, of a Wirsung canal of moderate caliber. Two TACOSIL compresses are placed on the vessels. A drain is placed on the Wirsung, as well as a multi-tubulated blade ahead of the great omentum and draining the posterior face of the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis. The pancreatic cutting was not invaded during the extemporaneous anatomo-pathological examination. The operating effects were simple with an authorized exit of fifteen days after the operation. No hemorrhagic recurrence was noted up to this date after eight months of passed time.',\n",

On examination and investigation at the emergency department, she showed the following signs of GD1: splenomegaly, anemia (hemoglobin level 11.3 g/dl, red blood cell count 4.01 million cells/mul, and hematocrit level 34.4%), and thrombocytopenia (148 000/nl). The patient was on long-term substrate reduction monotherapy with oral eliglustat (daily dose 84 mg) for 2 years. This dosage regimen is based on her cytochrome P450 2D6 genotype (poor metabolizer, PM). The patient did not take any concomitant medication. In February 2021, in a suicidal attempt, she ingested all at once 94 capsules of eliglustat (84 mg of eliglustat per capsule) which is a total of almost 8 g of eliglustat. The patient herself called the ambulance within the first hour after ingestion of the medication. Upon arrival of the emergency physician, she was already somnolent and hemodynamically unstable. The patient showed severe bradycardia (37 bpm) and hypotension (70/50 mmHg). The emergency physician promptly administered atropine (1 mg) and also cafedrine/theoadrenaline (100 mg/5 mg) into a forearm vein. When she was in a stable condition, the patient was transferred to the nearby emergency unit. Upon arrival at hospital, heart rate and blood pressure were no more below normal (heart rate 80 bpm and blood pressure 100/75 mmHg), and the patient remained in a stable condition. No respiratory insufficiency was detected (oxygen saturation 94% and respiratory rate 10/min). Neurological examination revealed mild somnolence with lack of concentration. A complete blood analysis showed normal serum electrolyte levels, normal liver and kidney function, and normal blood glucose levels. A broad toxicology screening in urine (methamphetamine, cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol, ecstasy, methadone, morphine/heroine, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturate, amphetamines, and buprenorphine) was negative. During 24 h of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring at the intensive care unit an increased frequency of supraventricular ectopic activity and mild first-degree atrioventricular block (PR interval: 206 ms) were observed. The patient improved gradually by supportive care (fluid therapy). After 24 h, the reactions had resolved completely and the patient was transferred to a psychiatric facility for follow-up (suspected undiagnosed schizophrenia).

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan revealed a bilateral common iliac artery aneurysm and abdominal aorta tortuosity (Figure 1(b)). The right common iliac artery aneurysm was estimated to be 5.0 cm in diameter accompanied by mural thrombosis (Figure 1(c)). He also reported a ten-year history of back pain. He was subsequently referred to magnetic resonance image (MRI) evaluation, which showed marked degenerative changes of lumbar spine and narrowing of the spinal cord (Figure 1(d)). He underwent an endovascular repair of the aneurysm and the procedure was uneventful. Family history was positive for sudden death in the proband's father (I-1) at the age of 48, for which the underlying cause remained unknown. Subsequent screening of his children revealed prominent dilation of the ascending aorta in the 22-year-old son (III-1). Neither of his mother (I-2) and daughter (III-2) presented vascular anomalies at the time of evaluation.\\n SMAD3 screening identified a heterozygous substitution of guanine to adenine at nucleotide 266 in the coding sequence of exon 2 (c.266G>A), in individuals II-1 and III-1 (Figure 2(a)). This variant resulted in a transformation of Cysteine into Tyrosine at amino acid position 89 (p.Cys89Tyr). It was not present in the unaffected individuals of the pedigree or in the 100 controls. Furthermore, this variant was not annotated in major databases, such as the Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genome, and dbSNP139. The altered amino acid is highly conserved across species (Figure 2(b)). Three programs for analyzing protein functions, PolyPhen2, SIFT, and MutationTaster, predicted that the p.C89Y variants are possibly damaging and disease causing, respectively. All three different algorithm based bioinformatics programs yield a consistent result of detrimental effect of the variant, suggesting that the site (C89) plays pivotal roles in the function of SMAD3.\",\n",

The pain was a 7/10 on the visual analogue scale. Review of symptoms was positive for fatigue and negative for bowel or bladder dysfunction. Pertinent physical exam findings included the following: no tension signs, right antalgic gait, right paraspinal tenderness, and normal lumbar spine range of motion. The neurologic exam was normal except for an absent right patellar reflex. The patient had previously underwent multiple lumbar spine surgeries related to a work injury, including L4-L5 right endoscopic discectomy, L3-S1 laminectomies and posterolateral instrumental fusion, L2-L3 lateral left interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation, and correction of L1-L2 segmental kyphosis with extension of fusion to T10 with T10-L5 posterior segmental instrumentation. X-rays and MRIs were obtained at this time, showing instability and spinal stenosis at L1-2. This was above her prior fusion level.\\nThe patient elected to have a L1-2 laminectomy with removal of all prior posterior spinal instrumentation and extension of the posterior fusion from L2-T10 with instrumentation placed posterior from T10-L5. She had no acute complications following surgery and was discharged on postoperative day 5.\\nAt the patient's 2-week postoperative visit, she reported a 2-day history of acute onset excruciating pain over her lower thoracic region with radiation throughout her ribs and lower back. She also had difficulty walking due to diffuse, ascending weakness, pain, numbness, and tingling in her legs bilaterally, without bowel or bladder dysfunction. The patient reported that she was doing well until the onset of these symptoms and denied any preceding fevers or signs of infection. On physical exam, she was afebrile and her wound was healing well. Neurologic exam revealed varying degrees of muscle weakness in all lower extremity groups with diffuse hyposensitivity to touch over dermatomes L3-S1. There was trace patellar reflexes and absent Achilles reflex bilaterally. She received an immediate thoracic and lumbar MRI with and without contrast. MRI showed no significant cord compression or epidural hematoma or abscess, although there was difficulty interpreting the studies due to extensive spinal hardware. Further imaging was obscured due to her extensive spinal instrumentation from prior surgeries (Figure 1).\\nThe patient returned to the operating room 1 week later for exploration of the spine due to the inconclusive imaging and worrisome symptoms and physical exam findings. Cross-link instrumentation was removed at this time, and her laminectomy at L1 was revised. There was no evidence of postoperative hematoma or spinal compression noted intraoperatively. Neurology was consulted, and postoperative nerve conduction testing and electromyography (EMG) were performed in order to further elucidate the cause of her symptoms (Figure 2). EMG and nerve conduction studies showed generalized nonlength-dependent sensory greater than motor polyneuropathy with mostly axonal features. Given the acute onset of her symptoms and lack of significant demyelinating features on nerve conduction studies, the findings were indicative of AMSAN, which is an axonal variant of GBS.\\nThe patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy as well as antiganglioside antibodies. During her first month of treatment, she experienced partial neurologic recovery and then relapsed back to her baseline symptoms at 6-week postoperative. She is currently in in-patient rehabilitation being treated with physical therapy, IVIG, and antiganglioside antibodies with minimal neurologic recovery at this time.\",\n",

His past medical history was unremarkable, especially with no acute or chronic sinusitis.\\nEndoscopy showed mild edema of the mucosa of the ethmoid cells without any signs of purulent nasal discharge. Ptosis and miosis of the right eye (Fig. 1a) were found, consistent with Horner syndrome. Signs of paralysis of the oculomotor nerve included palsy of right eye movement when looking upwards (Fig. 1b), during adduction (Fig. 1c), and looking downwards. No further neurological deficits were found, and the visual acuity was normal.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed acute right sphenoidal sinusitis with subtle irregularities of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous segment in the 3D TOF MRA and TWIST. Furthermore, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, ophthalmic vein, superior petrosal sinus, sigmoid sinus, internal jugular vein, and sphenoparietal sinus on the right side (Fig. 2) was seen in post-contrast acquired images. The additional computed tomography scan showed a permeative osseous erosion of the posterior and lateral walls of the right sphenoid sinus, while the carotid artery remained covered by bone (Fig. 2d).\\nGiven the above-mentioned intracranial complications, surgical drainage of the right sphenoidal sinus was indicated. Endoscopic sinus surgery with neuronavigation, including endoscopic septoplasty, middle meatotomy, and drainage of the sphenoidal sinus was performed. Surgical access to the sphenoidal sinuses was exclusively paraseptal with consecutive enlargement of the natural ostium with drainage of purulent discharge of the right sphenoid sinus; the cavity was otherwise intact.\\nPenicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the intraoperative nasal swab; the histology showed chronic inflammatory changes of the tissue, with no signs of malignancy.

For patient A, the micro-induction procedure began with a 2 mg sublingual film of buprenorphine. The film was divided into four parts of 0.5 mg buprenorphine that was administered in intervals of one-half to one hour under direct supervision in the clinic. Following complete dosing, 50 mg of methadone was administered.\\nThe Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Score (COWS) scale was used to quantify the severity of opiate withdrawal. The COWS scale establishes severity ranges based on patients' signs or symptoms in the following manner: Scores 5-12 = mild; 13-24 = moderate; 25-36 = moderately severe; more than 36 = severe withdrawal. COWS was obtained at the start of micro-dosing and thirty minutes after completion (Table 1). Mild withdrawal symptoms of sweating, chills, fatigue, and nausea were observed on the first day with a COWS score of 9.\\nThe dose of buprenorphine was increased to 3 mg on day two, followed by the administration of 50 mg of methadone. On day three, patient A was scheduled to take 6 mg of buprenorphine, but decided to take 4 mg to align his treatment course with his wife. On this day, he reported feeling anxious and had a COWS of 0. On day 4, he was administered 8 mg buprenorphine with methadone dosing.

Electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac work-up at that time showed unstable angina requiring percutaneous coronary intervention. Femoral artery catheterization was attempted and unsuccessful, so radial artery catheterization had to be performed. After the coronary stent was placed her chest, pain resolved but she continued to have lower extremity rest pain. Computed tomography (CT) performed at that time showed infrarenal occlusion of the aorta with positive collateral flow. She was told to follow-up with her vascular surgeon but was lost to follow-up.

Further evaluation through computed tomography angiogram at that time revealed infrarenal occlusion of the abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries with reconstitution of the external iliac arteries (Figure 1). Additional work-up was performed to rule out causes of limb ischemia. EKG showed no signs of acute cardiac ischemia or infarction. Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and no cardiac wall abnormalities. Coagulation studies including D-dimer testing, COVID testing, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome enzyme studies, and Factor 5 Leiden deficiency were all negative.

Patient had already been a wearer of complete dentures in both arches and she wanted them to be replaced by fixed prostheses. After clinical and radiological assessments (Figure 1), considering the loss of the bone and labial support, two treatment options had been presented for the patient: implant supported overdentures or implant supported hybrid dentures. The former was refused by the patient. Considering her financial status, lower arch was preferred to be treated with an implant supported overdenture, considering the insufficient bone height and width.\\nAfter clinical and radiological assessments including computerized tomography, it was decided that the patient was a candidate to receive implant supported rehabilitation. Maxillary and mandibular restorations were planned to restore both hard and soft tissues. Thus, seven internal hexed titanium implants (WIS, Merate, Italy) were inserted according to manufacturer's recommendations. Implant locations were 15, 13, 11, 16, 26, 23, and 21 (Figures 2 and 3). Two-staged approach was employed and implants were left to submerged healing. After four months of an osseointegration period, healing abutments were placed by a palatal crestal incision. A coronally repositioned flap from the palatal soft tissue was achieved in order to facilitate a gain of attached tissue and tension-free closure of the flap around the healing abutments (Figure 4).\\nSoft tissue around the healing abutments was left to mature for 3 weeks after the second-stage surgery. Impressions were taken using the pick-up technique and a try-in for the quantitative assessment of occlusal vertical dimension and aesthetic appearance evaluation was performed on the wax-up. To determine the position of the future teeth, a complete denture try-in with plastic teeth was made. This setup is considered as the facial border of the future planned wax-up and it also helps the technician to construct a computerized design for this hybrid prosthesis which stimulates the final restoration (Figure 5).\\nA porcelain metal substructure was fabricated by CAD-CAM technology, and this structure was sintered by laser to create retention grooves that increase the mechanical retention between the metal and the composite material. In addition to the mechanical retention, chemical retention was provided by a proprietary bonding agent (GC Metalprimer II) (Figures 6, 7, and 8).\\nHybrid prosthesis was fixed to the implant abutments at sites 15, 11, 16, 26, 23, and 21 by occlusal screws. Implant at site 13 was found to be placed, tilted to the vestibular aspect during the first surgery, so this abutment at site 13 was cemented to the framework to provide a parallel path of insertion to the framework and to improve this implant's emergence profile (Figure 9).\\nHybrid denture teeth and the artificial soft tissue were made by 75% Nanofilled Composite and 25% acryl in composition (NFC; UDMA with inorganic nanofillers, Condulor). The lower overdenture was made by acrylic teeth and metal supported acrylic flange. The abutments were screwed to the implants. Hybrid denture was cemented to number 13 and screwed to the other abutments though a torque wrench to generate the preload that keeps the prosthetic components together. After that occlusion was adjusted, the end result provided adequate contour to facilitate maintenance and healthy gingival tissues (Figures 10, 11, and 12).\",\n",

Furthermore, metabolic accumulation was detected at a pulmonary nodule located in the basal segment of the right lower lobe, 16 x 12 mm in size, strongly suspected of being a malignancy.\\nThe patient had no comorbidity and was in excellent condition, according to her young age. She had a term pregnancy 2 years before and she was still breastfeeding her child at the time of the diagnosis. No other causes for hospitalization and no family history of cancer were reported. She had normal body mass index, no history of smoking, nor alcohol habits. She had a good blood exam and a normal cardiac ultrasound; so, she was started on a regimen with docetaxel 75 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (TAC regimen) with GCSF support (pegfilgrastim 24 h after chemotherapy).\\nOn the seventh day, the patient came to the oncology ward for abdominal pain that she scored as 8 (VAS scale), obstinate constipation since the day of therapy, and fever. She was found to be neutropenic (neutrophil count 500/mm3) despite the use of GCSF support after chemotherapy. A CT scan showed severe thickening of the ascending colon, part of the caecum and of the proximal transverse colon; the distal transverse colon was normal. The pathological thickness was measured as 15 mm with diffuse hyperemia of the mucosa and marked hypodensity of the submucosa (Fig. 1).\\nNeutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) was diagnosed, and we aimed to manage the case with medical treatment which consisted of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin), GCSF (filgrastim 30 one administration per day that was continued for 2 days until neutrophil count was >1,000/mm3), hydration, bowel rest, and parenteral nutrition.\\nAfter 2 days from hospitalization and antibiotic therapy, the neutrophilic count was normal, the fever was gone, but the abdominal pain was getting worse. So, she underwent a second CT scan which reported an increased circumferential thickness of the transverse colon (16 vs. 14 mm) involving almost the entire transverse colon. A surgical evaluation indicated the need for surgery; so, the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy with resection of the caecum and right and transverse colon till the splenic flexure with lateral ileostomy (Fig. 2).\\nThe histological examination showed widespread full-thickness necrotic phenomena with the presence of granulocytic infiltrate involving all the colic wall with extension to the pericolic adipose tissue and to the visceral peritoneum (Fig. 3).',\n",

In January 2010, a corneal opacity OU was detected in a healthy 41-year-old male by his primary ophthalmologist when the patient was treated for hordeolum in the left eyelid. He was referred to Kanazawa University hospital for corneal opacity OU in May 2010. At the initial visit, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/16 OD and 20/16 OS. Intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Central corneal thickness was 633 mum OD and 648 mum OS. Endothelial cell density was 2,336/mm2 OD and 2,352/mm2 OS. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed a subepithelial opacity in the mid-peripheral to peripheral cornea OU and numerous opacities located at the level of Descemet's membrane OU; however, it was difficult to distinguish precisely the location of the opacity (i.e. deep stroma or Descemet's membrane) (fig. 1). No abnormal findings were noted upon fundus examination. In vivo laser confocal microscopy (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 2 Rostock Cornea Module, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Dossenheim, Germany) showed numerous hyperreflective particles in the subepithelium to superficial stroma OU (fig. 2c, d) and hyperreflectivity of Descemet's membrane OU (fig. 2h). No abnormal findings were noted in the epithelial cell layer, midstroma, deep stroma, and endothelial cell layer (fig. 2a, b, e-g, i). The patient had been a soft contact lens user for 16 years. Although his used soft contact lens OU showed a brown discoloration, metal deposition was not detected with differential interference contrast microscope (fig. 3b). The patient had no skin disorders, no history of metal exposure, and no family history of corneal diseases. He had taken an alpha lipoic acid-containing dietary supplement for a 1-year period in 2005. No abnormal findings were noted on blood testing including serum copper, liver and renal function. Based on the clinical appearance and in vivo laser confocal microscopy findings, a differential diagnosis of pre-Descemet's membrane corneal dystrophy and corneal argyrosis was excluded, but the clinical diagnosis was unclear.

He was born at 40 weeks after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. During the first months of life, the child presented hypertonus and eye rolling movements. Afterwards, a severe delay of psychomotor development became apparent, characterized by legs hypertonia, axial hypotonia, dyskinetic movements and myoclonic jerks of the arms and the head, no eye contact, and uncoordinated eye movements. The first epileptic seizure occurred at 5 months without fever, characterized by salivation, loss of contact and clonic jerks on the left side of the body. The first seizure lasted 20 minutes and the interictal EEG showed slow waves on the left occipital regions. Over time, several seizure types occurred, characterized by: a) left eye and head deviation with clonic jerks on the left side of the body; b) generalized hypertonia, loss of contact, uncoordinated movements of eye and limbs, cyanosis, and facial and arms twitching; or c) loss of contact, generalized hypotonia and clonic jerks, and tachycardia or bradychardia. Occasionally, at the end of the ictal event, dyskinetic (particularly choreiform) movements of the limbs appeared, without recovery of consciousness. The seizures, with or without fever, could be prolonged (20-30 minutes) and were frequently followed by sleep. Between seizures, the child always showed head tonic extension, erratic limb movements and tremor. The interictal EEG showed multifocal spikes over the right centro-temporal and the left parieto-occipital regions.\\nAt three years of age, absences with eye up deviation and eyelid myoclonus appeared ( Figure 1 ). The other seizure types persisted, although reduced in frequency. Seizures were resistant to many drugs (phenobarbital, benzodiazepine, valproic acid, levetiracetam, lamotrigine); absences frequency was improved by ethosuximide.

The patient gave a history of pain that persisted for about a few minutes even after removing the stimulus, and sometimes, it occurred spontaneously. The patient had good general health without any significant medical history. The patient gave an account of root canal treatment and crown placement in his upper right first molar tooth 2 years ago. On clinical examination, tooth 17 had mesial caries, and tooth 16 had a crown. There was no extraoral or intraoral swelling or sinus tract associated with the concerned teeth. The attached gingiva was normal in appearance and palpation. Both the teeth were nontender to percussion. Cold testing (Roeko Endo Frost, Coltene/Whaledent Inc., OH, USA) showed an immediate and prolonged response in tooth 17. Pre-operative periapical radiographs revealed caries almost approaching mesial pulp horns concerning tooth 16 and a typical periradicular architecture. Radiograph also revealed inadequately obturated tooth 16 and full coverage extra coronal restoration [Figure 1A and B]. Tooth 17 was diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with normal periapical tissues. Tooth 16 was diagnosed with previously endodontically treated. We planned for a root canal treatment in tooth 17 and a nonsurgical retreatment for tooth 16. For the sake of convenience, we have limited the description to the treatment performed only on the maxillary second molar.\\nAfter taking informed consent, local anesthesia was administered using lidocaine hydrochloride 2% with adrenaline 1:80,000 (Lignospan Special; Septodont, Saint-Maur-Des-Fosse, France). Access opening was made under rubber dam isolation and magnification (OPMI Pico Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). Three mesial canals, one distobuccal (DB), and one palatal canal were detected on exploration. Coronal flaring was done (Hyflex 25/08) after negotiation with a no. 10 and 15 k file. A soft, sticky catch between the MB 3 and MB2 created doubt for the presence of the fourth mesial canal as well [Figure 1D]. The access was temporized, and a limited Field of View (FOV 5 cm x 5 cm) CBCT scan (Carestream CS9300 imaging system; Carestream Health, Inc., New York) was advised to confirm the findings.\\nImage volume was reconstructed with isotropic isometric 90 mum x 90 mum x 90 mum voxels. The workstation comprised the dual monitors (Dell 24-inch nonglossy monitor (1920 x 1200 resolution) with a Dell Precision Workstation using CS 3D software (v3.5.7). CBCT revealed four canals in the mesiobuccal root, two canals in the DB root, and one palatal canal. The configuration of mesial canals was (4-1). What we had located were MB1, MB2, and MB4. A small opening for MB3 was present between MB2 and MB4, merging with MB4 in the middle third. MB1, MB2, and MB4 all joined together as one canal in the apical one third [Figure 2A-F]. There was one canal orifice at the floor for the DB canal, dividing into two and then reuniting again in the middle third and continuing as a single canal till the apex exhibiting Vertucci's Type III (1-2-1) pattern [Figure 2A-F].\\nIn the next visit, working length was established using an electronic apex locator (Canal Pro, Coltene/Whaledent, GmbH + Co. KG, Germany) and reconfirmed by periapical radiographs from different angulations [Figure 1C and F]. Canals were shaped using Hyflex CM (Coltene/Whaledent Inc., OH, USA) files up to the following sizes: MB1-25/06, MB2-25/04, MB3-25/04, MB4-25/04 [Figure 1E]. The DB was shaped till 30/04, and the palatal canal up to size 40/04. After taking a master cone radiograph [Figure 1G], the final irrigation protocol was employed. Sodium hypochlorite was activated using Endoactivator (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues Switzerland) followed by 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for 1 min per canal. Normal saline was used as the final flush. The canals were dried using paper points and obturated using AH Plus sealer (Dentsply, DeTrey, GmbH, Germany) employing warm vertical compaction (Elements, Sybron Endo, Glendora, CA) technique. The access cavity was restored with composite resin (Filtek P 60,3M ESPE, USA) [Figure 1H and I]. A post obturation CBCT investigation confirmed satisfactory obturation in all the canals [Figure 2G-J].

He was resuscitated as per the ATLS protocol at the hospital where he was initially treated and when he arrived at the casualty department of our hospital, he was conscious and all his vital parameters were within normal limits. He also gave the history that he was under treatment for segmental myoclonus which was characterised by semirhythmic involuntary muscle contractions.\\nHis radiographs showed a left-sided posterior acetabular wall fracture (AO type 6 2 A1). He also had an ipsilateral femoral neck fracture with the femoral head displaced anteriorly (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) and also an associated middle-third fracture of the shaft of the femur (Figure 1(c)). He also had an extra-articular distal femur fracture on the opposite side (AO type 3 3 A1). On arrival, his serum lactate level was 1.9 mmol/l indicating that he had been adequately resuscitated.\\nHe was taken for definitive surgery 9 hours after arrival. The patient was positioned in the lateral position and a posterolateral approach was planned to address the acetabular and femoral head fractures. Upon dissection, the femoral head (Figure 2(a)) was found to have buttonholed and displaced anteriorly through the capsule which was found to be torn. The posterior wall of the acetabulum was addressed using two contoured reconstruction plates (Figure 2(b)). Using the trochanteric flip osteotomy, better access to the femoral neck was achieved and the femoral head was reduced anatomically and secured with K-wires. Then the femoral shaft fracture was reduced by opening the fracture site and held with a clamp. The femoral head fracture and the shaft fracture were fixed with an antegrade femoral nail with two screws securing the femoral head (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). The flip osteotomy was fixed using a tension band wire and the joint was reduced. The torn capsule was sutured. Closure was done in layers. The operating time was 4 hours and the intraoperative blood loss was 600 ml. Three days following this surgery, the contralateral distal femur fracture was addressed using a titanium locking plate. The postoperative period was uneventful.\\nThree weeks after the initial surgeries, the patient experienced an episode of rhythmic contractions of the lower limbs at his home. He presented to us with an anterior dislocation of the left hip joint (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). An open surgery was done to reduce the left hip joint (Figure 3(c)). Considering the displacement of the femoral head at the time of initial presentation, the chances of avascular necrosis of the femoral head was explained to the patient. The patient was also on follow-up treatment with a neurologist to manage the myoclonus problem.\\nFour weeks after the surgery to relocate the femoral head, non-weight-bearing mobilization was initiated. As expected, avascular necrosis of the femoral head occurred (Figure 4(a)) and we waited for union of the femoral shaft to occur as any procedure to address the femoral head would require removal of the intramedullary nail.\\nEight months after the initial surgery and after union of the femoral shaft fracture, the patient was planned for total hip replacement surgery. Through a posterior approach, the antegrade femoral nail was removed. The acetabulum was reconstructed using a cage, and an uncemented hydroxyapatite-coated stem was used for the femur (Figure 4(b)). A ceramic on a polybearing surface was used. Postoperatively, there was no shortening of the limb. Immediate full weight-bearing mobilization was started using walker support. One year following the hip replacement surgery and 22 months following the initial trauma, the patient was ambulatory without any support and able to do all activities with an LEFS (lower extremity functional score) of 72. The radiographs showed complete union of all the fractures and there was no loosening of the femoral prosthesis.',\n",

There were symptoms of heart failure (NYHA II), and the Heart Team opted for TA-TAVI.\\nOn November 2016, the patient underwent TAVI to implant a 3-29 mm Edwards Sapien valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) via left anterior mini-thoracotomy. Both the operation and the immediate post-operative course were devoid of significant complications, allowing rapid weaning off pharmacological support, and extubation after 6 h. After 6 days, the patient was discharged in good general clinical and cardiocirculatory condition. The surgical site was as expected at discharge and early post-operative check-ups.\\nHowever, roughly 18 months after surgery, and despite appearing in good health and totally asymptomatic, the patient was once more seen by the heart surgeon due to a previously unnoticed apex beat suggestive of left ventricular pseudoaneurism. Thoracic CT revealed a 40 x 54 x 39 mm plurilocular accumulation with density greater than fluid from the anterior wall of the left ventricle to the subcutaneous soft tissues, through the intercostal space between ribs 5 and 6; its walls were significantly enhanced after contrast. Cardiac MRI was indicative of siero-haematic accumulation with no evidence of communication with the left ventricular cavity or signs of active bleeding.\\nSurgery was performed to drain the accumulation, exposing the cardiac apex and removing the sutures and foreign matter from the previous operation (sent for culture, this was negative for bacterial growth). Curettage was performed, leaving the thoracotomy open until the wound was clean. Antibiotic therapy with Daptomycin was administered in the post-op and for 2 weeks. After three weeks there was a wide, full-thickness defect in the thoracic wall exposing left ventricle movement.\\nThe Plastic Surgery proposed via perforator flap repair. A portable Doppler probe was used to identify an intercostal artery perforator in the 6th intercostal space; a tear-shape flap was centred on this vessel, with the upper margin of the flap coinciding with the lower margin of the defect (Figure 1). After debridement, the flap was raised and the pedicle directly examinated. We found that the flap could be sufficiently mobilised without using the island technique, thereby sparing the inferior and medial extensions of the surgical incision. The portion of tissue distal to the perforator was de-epithelialized and used to fill the defect; fibrin sealant Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL) was applied to promote flap adhesion to the surrounding tissue and further reduce dead space (Figure 2(A-C)). The wound was closed by bringing the upper margin of the flap to the upper margin of the defect (Figure 3). Surgery time for wound cleaning and reconstruction was 100 min. At the last clinical and CT control (June 2019) the flap was completely consolidated with the thoracic tissues, scars were well healed and no distortion of the thoracic surface was noted (Figure 4(A,B)).',\n",

At her initial visit, a physical examination of the hip revealed limited range of motion, particularly in flexion and internal rotation. Additionally, the anterior impingement test was positive with pain induced on flexion combined with internal rotation. The routine radiological examination (anterior-posterior radiograph) showed findings of DDH with a Sharp angle and centre-edge (CE) angle of 50  and 7 , respectively. The crossover sign and posterior wall sign were identified by radiography and computed tomography indicating the presence of acetabular retroversion (Fig. 1). Based on the clinical and radiological findings, a diagnosis of DDH combined with acetabular retroversion was made for this patient. Considering the persistent nature of pain and disability for the preceding year, surgical intervention was indicated. \\nAt surgery, hip arthroscopy was performed prior to CPO. The surgical set-up for hip arthroscopy followed the technique reported by Philippon et al.. Under general anaesthesia, the patient was positioned supine on the fracture table that allowed independent lower extremity traction. Two portals (lateral and anterolateral) were established for the scope and the instruments. The arthroscopic examination revealed a full thickness labral tear at the anterior-superior region (Fig. 2). A labral tear was identified at the anterosuperior edge of the acetabulum, and the tear was fixed back to the rim using two suture anchors (Fig. 3). Additionally, a motorized burr and shaver were used to remove the osteochondral surface and synovium at and around the head-neck junction to avoid impingement on the repaired site. Subsequently, CPO was carried out following the technique described by Naito et al. with the patient repositioned on the operative table in supine position. Three poly-l-lactic acid screws were used to fix the reoriented acetabular fragment, while two double-threaded metal screws were used for the fixation of the osteotomized anterior superior iliac supine. The post-operative radiograph showed improved acetabular coverage of the femoral head with a resultant Sharp angle of 36  and CE angle of 50 , while the crossover sign as well as the posterior wall sign was no longer evident (Fig. 4). Post-operatively, passive motion of the operative hip was initiated on the first post-operative day. Weight-bearing was not allowed for 2 weeks. Thereafter, partial weight-bearing began with progression to full weight-bearing at 8 weeks.   \\nHealing of the osteotomy site and functional recovery were accomplished uneventfully during the subsequent period.

The initial blood test results were as follows: hemoglobin level, 15.4 g/dL; platelet count, 218,000/mm3; prothrombin time, 11.5 s; APTT, 24.3 s; aspartate transaminase level, 526 IU/L; and alanine transaminase level, 545 IU/L. The contrast-enhanced CT findings revealed hepatic contusion of the sixth segment based on Couinaud's classification, and classified as grade 1 according to the AAST classification. The patient also presented traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, facial bone fracture, right hemothorax, and multiple rib fractures. We treated the liver injury conservatively and followed up with contrast-enhanced CT at 1 week after the accident. The findings showed a false aneurysm of the hepatic artery at the liver injury site and a thrombus (maximum diameter, 1.5 cm; length, 6.5 cm) in the IVC (Fig. 2). As in Case 1, the patient started walking early, but was not treated with anticoagulants. The hepatic false aneurysm was treated with arterial embolization after implanting an IVC filter. At 1 week after unfractionated heparin treatment, the contrast-enhanced CT findings showed that the thrombus had shrunk. The patient was discharged after replacing the anticoagulant with oral medication.\",\n",

His medical history was only pertinent for seasonal allergy and a mild COVID-19 infection that did not require hospital admission 4 months prior to evaluation. He was taking no medications. Six weeks prior to presentation, the patient had developed a skin rash on his lower legs that erupted 2 weeks after he received the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 (mRNA), Pfizer, Inc) (Figure 1). His primary care provider treated the rash with fluocinonide 0.05% cream, applied to the affected area twice daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Three weeks after the first vaccine injection, the patient received his scheduled second vaccine injection. Within 2 days, the skin rash reappeared. This time, the lesions were more severe in nature, with violaceous nonblanching papules and blisters involving the same area on his lower legs but also affecting his thighs, the dorsal aspect of his forearms, lower abdomen, upper back, and buttocks. He reported concomitant myalgias. He denied gross hematuria or dark or foamy urine. Skin biopsy revealed IgA-dominant leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient was treated with prednisone for 3 weeks: 60 mg daily for the first week, 40 mg daily for the second week, and 20 mg daily for the third week.\\nAfter completion of 2 weeks of oral corticosteroids, urinalysis revealed proteinuria, and a nephrology consultation was requested. On examination in the nephrology clinic, the patient's vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 122/81 mmHg. Healing papules were noted on his lower extremities, but otherwise the physical examination was normal. Laboratory data are shown in Table 1. Two weeks after the second dose of vaccine, serum creatinine was normal at 0.9 mg/dL. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed acanthocytes (Figure 1). Three weeks after the second dose of vaccine, urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 1.1 g/day. Serum complements were normal, and all pertinent serology was negative. A second UPCR repeated 1 week later (4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine) was still elevated at 0.8 g/day. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment was repeated, and acanthocytes were again identified.\\nUpon discussion of risks and benefits of establishing a diagnosis, the patient agreed to a kidney biopsy. The biopsy was performed without complications and consisted of 16 glomeruli by light and immunofluorescence microscopy with 2 globally sclerosed with diagnostic changes of an IgA nephropathy with dominant polyclonal, lambda slightly more than kappa, mesangial staining by immunofluorescence microscopy, and corresponding scattered mesangial deposits by electron microscopy. Mild mesangial hypercellularity was present in only 1 of the 16 glomeruli in the light microscopy sample, with no endocapillary hypercellularity, no segmental sclerosis, minimal (approximately 5%) interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and no crescents or necrosis (Figure 2). The findings were diagnosed as IgA nephropathy, which in the context of the skin lesions was consistent with IgA vasculitis. Although the MEST-C score has not been validated in IgA vasculitis, these lesions correspond to M0E0S0T0C0 (M=mesangial proliferation, E=endocapillary proliferation, S=segmental sclerosis, T=tubulointerstitial fibrosis, C=crescents).\\nAfter the kidney biopsy, the patient began treatment with lisinopril 10 mg orally daily. No further immunosuppression was given. At a follow-up visit 1 week after the kidney biopsy, the rash had subsided completely. The UPCR 4 weeks after starting the lisinopril was 0.5 g/day.

History revealed that these symptoms were triggered by the death of his father. On detailed evaluation, it was found that he had been on treatment for his mental illness from 2005. The course of illness was continuous characterized by withdrawn behavior, preoccupation, fear, auditory hallucinations, referential delusions and decline in social and occupational functioning. He was evaluated by a psychiatrist and started on psychotropics. During follow-up, the patient complained of episodes of depressed mood, anxiety and sleep disturbance, lethargy and sleepiness that affected his shift work, for which he was prescribed modafinil 200 mg, along with the antipsychotics Risperidone 4 mg and Amisulpride 400 mg. The patient himself gradually increased the dose to overcome the drowsiness that interrupted his shift work. He started with 100 mg every 3-4 h over a shift work of 12 h. For the last 6 months he was unable to overcome his sleepiness during work without modafinil 100 mg/h thus making a total of 1200 mg/day of modafinil which he used to obtain over the counter. He claimed to have symptoms of worsening of lethargy, tremors of hands, anxiety and erratic sleep hours when he skipped modafinil, patient reported a sense of well-being only with the drug and with the above dose.\\nThere was no family history of mental illness. Physical examination was within normal limits except for fine tremors. His blood investigations gave the following values hemoglobin - 12.4 gm%;, WBC count - 6300 cells/mm3; platelet count - 2.4 lakhs/mm3;, random blood sugar - 122 mg/dl. His metabolic parameters including renal function, liver function, lipid profile were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function.\\nThe provisional diagnosis made was schizoaffective disorder currently in partial remission. An additional diagnosis of modafinil dependence syndrome (dependence criteria as per DSM V) was made in view of the tolerance, withdrawal, inability to cut down, progressive increase in the amount of drug over a longer period of time and craving.\\nThe dose was tapered slowly over a period of 1 month with 100 mg every 2-3 days and started on bupropion. He reported sleep disturbance, increased sense of body warmth, lethargy and low mood during the process of tapering the drug. Low dose of clonazepam was added to reduce the withdrawal symptoms. Patient reported significant improvement in his sleep pattern. His dysphoric mood and lethargy improved and his level of anhedonia and amotivation decreased.',\n",

The testes were normal to exam without palpable masses. The CT of the chest revealed innumerable pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic disease (Figure 1). CT abdomen showed a 6.9 x 8.0 x 7.6 cm retroperitoneal mass. An US of the testicles was done showing an ill-defined hypoechoic structure measuring 8 mm within the right testicle.

He underwent an open retropubic radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. The final pathology result revealed a Gleason score of 7 (4 + 3) adenocarcinoma with prostatic capsule and seminal vesicle involvement as well as perineural invasion.

This disorder was diagnosed 2 years before the pandemic onset by electromyography (EMG) and frontal muscle jitter study at the neurology unit of our hospital (Figure 1). AChR antibodies were detected, and and the thymoma ascertainment results were negative. He undertook pharmacology therapy consisting of pyridostigmine at a dosage of 30 mg three times daily, which was efficacious in treating myasthenic symptoms. The strength quantification performed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) was normal before the pandemic. At the beginning of December 2020, he developed fever, cough, myalgia, and dyspnea with progressive severe respiratory failure, which required ICU admission. He underwent chest computer tomography (CT) and nasopharyngeal swab that were positive for COVID-19 and was treated with remdesivir and corticosteroids. The patient underwent mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy. Laboratory tests did not detect an increase in the serum CK level. He also developed infections caused by multi-drug resistant germs, including Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and underwent multiple antibiotic therapies. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score was 35. During the ICU stay, 15 days after admission, he complained of muscle weakness that evolved into the manifestation of tetraparesis without ocular involvement. Despite this development, pyridostigmine was increased to 60 mg three times daily; the strength remained unchanged. The length of stay (LOS) in ICU was 35 days. After improvement of the clinical conditions, the patient was transferred to our neuro-rehabilitation (NR) unit. At admission, the patient breathed spontaneously but needed 3 L/m oxygen by mask. Capillary oximetry was 97%; he had a central venous catheter, a tracheal tube, and a nasal-gastric tube for nutrition. The neurological picture showed severe tetraparesis that involved predominantly the lower limbs, and he had absent tendinous reflexes. No deficit in ocular or facial muscles was detected, and superficial and deep sensibilities were normal. Given the neurological feature, on day 2 of admission, the patient underwent electroneurography (ENG), electromyography (EMG), and frontal muscle jitter study that confirmed MG and showed overlapping ICUAW. In this respect, the electrophysiological exam revealed signs characteristic of CIP (Table 1). However, a lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected and processed for standard analysis to exclude Guillain-Barre syndrome and polyneuropathies of different etiology. Pressure, cell count, and protein levels (<45 mg/dl) of the CSF were normal without albumin-cytologic disassociation. CSF/serum glucose ratio was normal. The CSF culture results for possible organisms, such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, Borrelia, enteroviruses, Herpes viruses, and CMV, were negative. Similarly, the laboratory test for autoimmune disorders, including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, a panel of antiganglioside antibodies, including anti-GM1, -GM2, -GM3, -GD1a, -GD1b, -GT1b, and -GQ1b, and a panel for paraneoplastic syndrome, were negative.\\nStrength and functional evaluation were quantified through the MRC scale sum-score, the Disability Rating scale (DRS), the Barthel scale (BS), and the functional independence measure (FIM) at admission, discharge, and 6 months of follow-up. During NR stay, the patient underwent a personalized and tailored rehabilitation treatment for 3 h daily, 6 days a week. Furthermore, he performed 2 h of daily electrical muscular stimulation on the lower limbs by placing surface electrodes on the quadriceps and anterior tibial muscles bilaterally. The muscular strength improved progressively, and the MRC sum score was 50 at discharge. The anticholinesterase therapy with pyridostigmine at the dosage of 30 mg three times daily, the same that the patient was taking before he had COVID-19, was resumed. His motor abilities recovered and, at discharge, he was able to walk without support but remained with left foot drop, which required the application of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO). Furthermore, he complained of mild fatigue with reduced endurance, which improved over time. At follow-up, the MRC scale sum score and all functional scale scores resulted to be normal (Table 2).

He underwent knee prosthesis surgery that lasted 114 min. The surgical procedure was uneventful. On the 2nd day, the patient complained of headache with the typical features of postural headache without other neurological symptoms or signs, in particular, there was no nuchal rigidity. PDPH was diagnosed and treatment with paracetamol and ketorolac, bed rest therapy, and hydration started. On the 4th postoperative day, the patient was pain free and he could be discharged 4 days later with anticoagulant therapy.\\nTwo days after discharge, the patient complained of severe headache and presented at our emergency department. Neurological examination was normal. The patient was discharged after hydration, corticosteroid (Soldesam 8 mg/die) was prescribed, and bed rest ordered.\\nDue to the persistence of headache and the change in the headache's characteristic, even being present in clinostatism, the patient visited again the emergency room; neurological examination was once again normal. In consideration of the persistence of headache in clinostatism, we decided to perform a brain computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed a bilateral subdural hematoma, larger on the right side (12 mm) causing a left-sided brain shift of about 5.3 mm [Figure 1]. The patient was hospitalized at the neurosurgical unit. Antiplatelet medication was suspended. Initially, given the absence of neurological deficit and in light of the dimensions of the bleed, which were borderline for surgical intervention, we adopted for a conservative treatment which consisted in bed rest, hydration, and analgesia. Four days later, the patient complained again of worsening headache, so we performed a brain CT scan which showed an increase in density of the subdural collection with an increase in brain shift [Figure 2]. Considering that the conservative treatment was not sufficient, we considered and proposed a subdural hematoma evacuation, which the patient accepted. Surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia and was uneventful. The postoperative CT scan showed the evacuation of the blood collection with reduction of the midline brain shift [Figure 3]. The patient reported a significant reduction of his headache. At this point, deambulation was commenced. On the 3rd postoperative day, the patient again complained of worsening of headache with accompanying photophobia. A brain CT scan was performed demonstrating a reformation of the subdural hematoma on the right side larger than that one before surgery; hydration, analgesia, and bed rest were again implemented [Figure 4a and b]. Nine days after the intervention, a cranial CT showed a further increase of the subdural blood collection with brain shift [Figure 4c]. At this point, as the only hematoma evacuation was not sufficient, we decided performing a lumbar blood patch and a surgical re-evacuation of the subdural hematoma. Lumbar blood patch was performed at L3-L4 level with midline approach, and 15 cc of a solution composed by the patient's blood, iopamiro, and fibrin glue was introduced through a Tuohy needle under fluoroscopic control. The surgical procedure was uneventful. Intraoperative fluoroscopy control showed a good extension from L2-L5 level. Surgical procedure of hematoma evacuation was regular. Radiological control showed a complete evacuation of subdural hematoma with decrease of the intracranial structure shift of the midline. The patient reported a complete resolution of headache. Three months after surgical procedure, the patient was symptom free, and CT scan showed a complete resolution of the subdural hematoma without brain shift [Figure 5].\",\n",

He underwent an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy showing a submucosal nodule in the gastric antrum, and an abdomen ultrasonography (US) showing multiple gallstones and a 3 cm pancreatic body lesion.\\nA chest-abdomen contrast medium Computed Tomography (CT)-scan detected a pancreatic body lesion of 26 mm axial diameter (O) with pancreatic duct dilation and perilesional lymphadenopathy with 15 mm O. Endoscopic US (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) showed a 37 mm O hypoechoic and inhomogeneous lesion comprising mesenteric-portal axis without a clear infiltration (uT3uN0, AJCC 2010). Cytology was conclusive for anaplastic/undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was positive for cytokeratin AE1-AE2, negative for S-100 protein, Melan-A, chromogranin-A (CgA), synaptophysin (Syn), and CD-56.\\nOn this basis after discussion within the gastrointestinal multidisciplinary team (GI-MDT), a diagnostic laparoscopy plus intraoperative US were performed showing no evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis but infiltration of splenic artery and upper mesenteric vein were seen. A peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) revealed the presence of neoplastic cells (Figure 1). Following a further multidisciplinary discussion, systemic chemotherapy was therefore proposed. The patient was asymptomatic; his performance status (PS) was 0 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Because of the particular histotype, he was not eligible for first-line chemotherapy trials, therefore a regimen with cisplatin (60 mg/mq day 1 every 21) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/mq days 1, 8, every 21) was decided on an individual scale and administered outside clinical trials (Figure 2). After day one of the second cycle, treatment was delayed because of thrombocytopaenia, and definitively discontinued because of unstable clinical status for acute lower limb peripheral neuropathy and appearance of upper abdominal pain. In the meantime, given the time from the start of chemotherapy, a restaging C-scan was performed, showing an increased pancreatic lesion (46 mm O) with dilatation of the Wirsung duct, and multiple pathological lymph nodes in the retroperitoneal region. As a result, we assumed that the patient had a metastatic disease, based on the radiological features (morphology, dimension, rapid growth, and contrast enhancement of paraaortic lymph nodes) and clinical evaluation (increased level of Ca 19.9, deterioration of the patient's clinical condition and the previously positive peritoneal cytology). On this basis a third GI-MDT discussion indicated a second-line systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFIRI (folinic acid 200 mg/mq; irinotecan 180 mg/mq; bolus fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/mq; continuous infusion 5-FU 2400 mg/mq) at 70% of the conventional dose.\\nFurthermore, because of the particular pattern of progression (expansive rather than infiltrating primary tumour growth) and its local symptomaticity, a locoregional palliative procedure was discussed.\\nTherefore, after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy the patient underwent high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation on the pancreatic lesion. The treatment was performed with computerised axial scanning and power Doppler to evaluate the effect of ablation on the artery engaged. The patient was placed in a prone position on the HIFU table, and then we verified that the abdomen skin was in very close contact with degassed water. The treatment was performed with vertical scanning mode separated by 5mm-distance between each slice. HIFU ablation was performed using the JC-HIFU system (Chongquing Haifu-HIFU-Tech, Chongquing, China). The procedure was supervised by real time US; the diameter of transducer that issues US energy was 20 cm with a focal length of 15 cm and a frequency of 0.8 MHz. The software used for the real time imaging unit was MyLab70 imaging device (Esaote, Genova, Italy). This 1.0 to 8.0 MHz imaging probe is located in the centre of the HIFU transducer. Treatment was carefully monitored with US guide and finished when the lesion showed a large part of coagulation necrosis in the centre. The duration of HIFU ablation was about 90'. At the end, US revealed an extended necrosis area on the pancreatic lesion. A CT-scan performed the day after revealed a 56 mm O pancreatic lesion and paraaortic lymphadenopathies. After HIFU the patient received five more cycles of modified FOLFIRI. A CT-scan performed six weeks after HIFU revealed a reduction of the pancreatic head lesion (45 mm versus 56 mm O) and of the left paraaortic lymph nodes (15 mm versus 33 mm O). A restaging CT-scan after four months from the HIFU treatment revealed a further reduction of the pancreatic lesion (38 mm versus 45 mm O) and left paraaortic lymph nodes (8.4 mm versus 15 mm O).\\nThe patient became totally asymptomatic after HIFU. Chemotherapy was well tolerated and is still ongoing.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'This paper discusses the sexual homicides of four victims, of both genders and different ethnicities, by a male 61-year-old African-American ordained Baptist Minister, in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties, over an 11-month time period, during the years 2000 and 2001. (The subject has given his full informed consent for the author to disclose all information pertaining to this case and his personal life.) The above brief review on the topics of serial murder, sexual homicide, and necrophilia will be compared with the particulars of this case. The actual acts of the perpetrator and his subjective viewpoint during the murders, in combination with crime scene information and psychological test data, will be utilized to create a comprehensive depiction of the factors that precipitated the decision to murder four human beings. Each homicide will be examined according to three distinct stages: the period during which Mr. D. met the victim and engaged in consensual activity, the period of coercive sexual activity, and Mr. D.\\'s postmortem sexual activity with his victims. A fourth stage, the disposal of the body, will be covered only briefly. The quotes included are Mr. D.\\'s verbatim statements regarding his subjective experience. (Clinical interview of the subject lasted 19 hours and was videotaped. The entire interview was transcribed verbatim.)\\nIn late May of the year 2000, when he was 59 years of age, Samuel D. met an apparently homeless African-American female, a casual acquaintance of his in her early 20\\'s, on a street near his apartment in Los Angeles. (\"Alicia\\'s\" body was never found. Mr. D. was convicted of this crime based on his admission to this homicide and three others, forensic details of which corroborated his report.) He \"became curious\" as to whether he could engage the woman in sexual activity and explicitly denied during interviews subsequent to the murder the existence of coercive or homicidal fantasies at this juncture. The two walked back to Mr. D.\\'s apartment, showered together, and engaged in consensual fondling. Mr. D. supplied Alicia with alcohol, crack cocaine, and marijuana. He did not use any substance. The two engaged in multiple vaginal intercourse for a period of between 24 and 48 hours, by Mr. D.\\'s estimate: \"there was a period of at least a day or so that she would have been there nude the whole while. And having sex with me ... like constantly.\"\\nConsensual sexual activity was brought to an end when Alicia expressed a desire to leave Mr. D.\\'s apartment. When asked if her refusal to continue to have sex with him was frustrating, he stated, \"I didn\\'t like it. If I got mad I wouldn\\'t know that I got mad.\" In sequence, Mr. D. reported that the following occurred: he prevented Alicia from exiting his bedroom by blocking the doorway with his body; he \"struck her a few times in the face,\" to incapacitate her and quiet her struggling; he used stereo speaker wire as ligature to bind the victim\\'s hands and feet behind her back, legs bent at the knee with feet in the air: \"I tied her so that her buttock area, her vaginal area would be exposed.\" He was questioned on his conscious motivations for binding Alicia. He reported \"I don\\'t want her to leave, I want to keep her. All I wanted was to fuck, I kept telling her that.\" He was also asked whether the act of binding the victim was sexually arousing to him: \"I don\\'t remember feeling sexual at all during that time, aroused or anything. The [ligature] was just to like make her still in the position I wanted her in.\"\\nIn contrast to his claim, evidence on each victim for which information is available suggests that Mr. D.\\'s use of either ligature or violence was extreme, and more than adequate than that which would be used only for restraint. For example, Mr. D. gagged Alicia with a blouse, sweater or washcloth (He was unable to remember precisely). When she would not quiet, he threatened her with a butcher knife approximately 12 inches long by 1.5 inches wide, by holding it above her chest in a stabbing gesture. He verbally threatened to kill her. Mr. D. was asked if he thought the victim was frightened (at this point she was bound, gagged, and was being threatened with a butcher knife). He replied \"I don\\'t think so.\" It is possible that the deficit in affect from which Mr. D. suffered, which facilitated both the lack of empathy for others and his use of predatory violence, rendered him unable to recognize the extreme nature of his behavior. It is also possible, however, that his denial of sadistic sexual pleasure is related to his knowledge that the level of violence used in his crimes would lead to a harsher penalty during the sentencing phase of his legal case.\\nMr. D. stated that he felt \"something akin to anger or frustration\" at Alicia\\'s constant struggling. He reported that, for the first time, he thought of drugging Alicia with the sedating tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline. The medication was in 25 mg tablet form, which he placed in the victim\\'s vagina and rectum. Mr. D. also fed the victim through a straw, into which he had placed medication. When sedation took effect, the victim\\'s struggles quieted. She remained bound and gagged. He now began to anally rape the victim, and when questioned on her emotional state at this point, he reported \"she reacted as if it was ... extremely painful ... [but] I don\\'t know what her reactions mean, I can only guess. They don\\'t give me a clue even now.\" \\nMr. D. was asked to report on his subjective state, at the point in time at which he had immobilized his victim and her anus and vagina were exposed for his use. He reported \"I could do what I want now. This girl is under my control. There are no barriers, there\\'s no resistance. Unlimited sex is here.\" Mr. D. then anally and vaginally raped this victim for a period of approximately 24 hours. He was asked what he felt for Alicia during this time: \"nothing, except here\\'s a body.\"\\nSexual activity ended after approximately 48 hours of consensual sex and 24 hours of coercive sex, when the victim died while being raped. Mr. D. denied any acute action by him that led to the victim\\'s death. In each homicide for which information is available, however, strangulation has been listed as one possible cause. \\nMr. D. continued to have anal and vaginal sex with the corpse, without pause from pre- to postmortem, for a period of roughly 48 hours. The corpse remained on his bed, bound and gagged. He covered the victim\\'s head with a cloth he found in his room, secondary to revulsion at the sight of her face, which was bloated and swollen from his blows. He was asked what was specifically arousing to him regarding sexual intercourse with a corpse. He responded \"It was just here\\'s a hole, basically.\" For the first time since her arrival, Mr. D. climaxed and ejaculated inside the victim\\'s vagina. \\nAfter roughly two days of nearly continuous sex with the corpse, Mr. D. \"couldn\\'t stand the smell or sight\" of the body anymore, and carried it from the bed to the bathtub. He reported that he had read a book on Jeffrey Dahmer and developed the idea to dispose of the body by pouring onto it bleach, liquid Plumr. lye, drano, and other solvents, in attempts at \"dissolving it.\" The body remained in the tub during the events of the second homicide.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'Approximately one week after he had murdered Alicia, Robyn W., a 37-year-old, African-American female acquaintance of Mr. D. appeared alone and unannounced at his door. Mr. D. quickly engaged Robyn in sexual conversation, and she agreed to enter his apartment. \\nConsensual sexual activity consisted of multiple vaginal and anal intercourse, for a period of between 24 and 48 hours. As he had done with Alicia, Mr. D. bought the victim crack cocaine, which she smoked at his apartment, and Cisco wine; once again, he did not use substances. Robyn\\'s statement to Mr. D. regarding her desire to leave the apartment to care for her children, signaled the onset of coercive activity. He \"pinned\" Robyn to the bed by sitting on her chest, and then bound her in a fetal position, so that he could \"get at ... either her pussy or her butt ...where I could stand up on the bed and fuck her with her facing up, on her back, with her feet and knees in the air. (The defendant placed pillows underneath Robyn so that he could have easier access to her vagina and anus as he stood on the bed.)\" When asked of his subjective experience at this point, Mr. D. stated \"I have control of them now. All the tying and drugging had achieved was to let me have sex like uninterrupted without ... fighting, because ... that detracted from it for me.\" Once again, Mr. D. denied sadistic arousal from the victim\\'s pain. The specifics of the behavioral evidence, however, suggest otherwise. \\nRobyn began to plead with Mr. D. and mentioned that she had children. Mr. D. reported that he \"ignored it,\" though may have said to her \"I told you what I wanted.\" He threatened her with the same knife he had used with Alicia. After he had restrained her with ligature, he gagged Robyn with a sweater he found on his bed, which was fastened into place with wire. He pulled another sweater over her head, covering her entire head and mouth. (This action was likely motivated by twin desires: to denigrate the victim and to heighten his own sense of control.) In contrast to his actions with Alicia, perhaps because he remembered the struggle which had ensued, Mr. D. immediately drugged Robyn with amitriptyline by inserting two to three tablets into her vagina. He then anally raped this victim:who remained bound, gagged, and drugged:for a period of between 36 and 48 hours, by his estimate. He denied any conversation: \"there was no reason for conversation ... there was no way she could stop it.\" After carrying Robyn to a corner of his bedroom and covering her with clothes and linens, Mr. D. left the bedroom for his kitchen, where he remained for between 15 and 60 minutes. He returned to the bedroom intent on continuing to have sex with Robyn, but reported that she was dead upon his entrance to the room.\\nThe coroner\\'s report of this death stated that death occurred from \"apparent multiple ligature strangulation,\" and \"possible blunt force trauma to the head and face.\" Mr. D. stated to two investigators and to myself that Robyn died while he was away from the room. He stated during a separate psychological evaluation that Robyn died during the act of being anally raped. Although he denies it, medical evidence suggests that Robyn died secondary to a volitional act from Mr. D.: either manual strangulation or blunt force trauma to the head.\\nMr. D. reported that \"the fact that [Robyn] wasn\\'t physically responding was not a problem.\" He did not remove the ligature from Robyn postmortem and stated that as he continued to have sex with the body he did not want to ejaculate because \"climaxing ended the sex. I [would have] had to stop. It was just sex, just sex, just sex and I didn\\'t want it to end.\" Mr. D. remains uncertain whether he ejaculated inside the corpse of Robyn. After roughly two days of nearly continuous vaginal and anal sex with Robyn\\'s corpse, Mr. D. \"pushed\" the body of his second victim into the bathtub, on top of his first victim. Like in the first homicide, the odor of the decomposing body, and the lividity change, precipitated his decision to discontinue sex.\\nMr. D. stated that during the time period between the death of Robyn and the death of his next victim, he began to consider abducting a person to keep as his \"sexual slave.\" He considered keeping the person either in a \"hiding place\" outside his apartment, and then transporting the victim to his home for sex, or inside the organ he had at his apartment. Around this time, he wrote a short narrative which makes clear that, while the death of Alicia may have been \"accidental,\" as he claimed during investigation after his confession, his subsequent behavior was planned, purposeful, and predatory. Mr. D. wrote: \"tools of the trade:cable wire, clothes, necktie (regarding his use of ligature, Mr. D. stated to me that he would use \"anything that was nearby ... like a necktie.\" This statement appears to belie that suggestion; it appears that ligature was chosen before the crimes, for specific purposes), gag-rope (and the search for more), better gag, then stocking cap and later, wire mask to keep in on. c*r got them off several times. (Why didn\\'t they scream?-fear of drugs. Need hand and leg cuffs:too many escapes. (learning the ropes) getting them on (g kept gedding loose and r same flysr kept waking up and moving things as if she knew what was coming ...\"\\nEither accidentally or deliberately, Mr. D. found an activity that suited his sexual appetites. He had no internal prohibitions in the form of conscience or fear of punishment which would preclude drugging, bondage, and rape. During our interview, Mr. D. took exception to my use of the term \"serial killer\" to describe him self. In responding to me that although he did not \"see\" himself as a serial killer, he stated that he might have \"killed more had the opportunity or circumstances been different.\" After he had committed his first murder, Mr. D. decided to kill again by using similar methods.\\nApproximately 7 to 14 days after he had killed Robyn, Mr. D. met his next victim, Salvador, a mentally disabled Hispanic male approximately 36 years of age. Mr. Reyes, according to Mr. D., approached him and offered sex in exchange for $15. Mr. D. accepted and the two walked from the street to Mr. D.\\'s apartment.\\nConsensual sexual activity consisted of multiple anal intercourse for a period of roughly four hours. Mr. D. assumed the dominant \"top\" position and did not allow Mr. Reyes to penetrate his anus. They did not kiss. (Kissing is perhaps the most affectionate sexual activity. Mr. D. either kissed his victims before they were bound or drugged, as a predatory \"grooming\" behavior, or did not kiss them at all.) During this intercourse, Mr. D. decided that Salvador \"was not ever going to leave ... I wanted to keep him there with me.\" He equated Salvador to a \"sex toy\" and to a \"sexual slave.\"\\nMr. D. drugged Salvador by giving him a beer into which he had placed amitriptyline. He also inserted tablets into Salvador\\'s anus. He then gagged him and put a nylon stocking over his head. Salvador\\'s struggles irritated Mr. D., and the two \"began fighting.\" Mr. D. again denied being sexually aroused by the act of binding the victim, by his pleas, or by the obvious pain the victim was in. He anally raped Salvador for approximately two days and one night, by his estimate. During times when Mr. D. left the apartment when Salvador was still alive, he carried him by the ligature to a closet. Upon his return, he transported Salvador back to his bed, to continue to rape him. \\nSalvador died while being anally raped. Mr. D. was asked what he had done to precipitate Salvador\\'s death. He responded \"nothing I knew except just fucking him.\" Mr. D. did not pause at the time of death, but \"went on\" anally raping Salvador, and continued to do so for between 24 and 48 hours, by his estimate. He was asked if it was more arousing to have sex with a live person or with a corpse. He stated \"it didn\\'t make any difference. I don\\'t remember it being any different.\" Mr. D. continued to engage in sexual activity with the corpse of Salvador until the body began to smell, at which point he put the still-bound body into a plastic bag, carried it down the stairs and placed it into a shopping cart, which he used to transport the body to a local park.\\nOn Saturday, 28 April 2001, approximately 11 months after he had committed his first homicide, Mr. D. traveled to San Diego to take part in a poetry reading at a local book store. He and his male companion arrived too late for the reading and were rescheduled; Mr. D. chose to spend the rest of his night in San Diego at a bath house frequented by gay males, for the purpose of engaging in anonymous sexual activity.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'Soon after his arrival at the bath house, he attempted to place several amitriptyline tablets he had brought with him from Los Angeles in the anus of a sleeping Black male; this man awoke briefly and pulled the sheet on which he was laying tighter around his body, which precluded Mr. D. from drugging him. He next engaged in simultaneous sexual activity with three men. During this, Gary B., a 46-year-old gay Caucasian male stranger approached him and expressed a desire for sex with the defendant, alone. Mr. D. refused, though after he had completed the sexual act with the other males left to find Gary. \\nThe two engaged in consensual anal intercourse at the bath house, after which Gary invited Mr. D. to his apartment in San Diego. They arrived at the apartment in the early morning hours of Sunday 29 April. Although Mr. D. had planned to drug Gary\\'s food early during this time, he did not because Gary did not eat with him. They again engaged in multiple consensual anal intercourse for a duration of several hours. They parted company during the day of Sunday and met that evening at Gary\\'s apartment, where Mr. D. watched pornographic videos. \\nAt approximately 5 P.M. the two engaged in multiple anal intercourse for a period of several hours, during which Mr. D. drugged Gary with amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. The method of drugging, in contrast to his activity with previous victims, was to insert the tablets into the foreskin of his penis, then insert his penis into Gary\\'s rectum. After a long period of sexual activity, Gary informed Mr. D. that he wished to discontinue the sexual activity and wanted to sleep so that he could go to work that morning. Mr. D. unplugged the clock in Gary\\'s room to prevent him from knowing the time. He later told investigators that the victim\\'s statement regarding his desire to stop having sex \"irritated\" him. He got up from the bed and, in a sullen gesture, went into the living room. Gary appealed to Mr. D. to either come back to bed and sleep or leave his apartment.\\nMr. D. was angry at Gary for not giving him what he wanted, and felt rejected and insulted by his suggestion that he leave. He stated to investigators that Gary\\'s statement, \"set [him] off ... I was upset he didn\\'t let me do what I wanted to do.\" Gary, said Mr. D., \"should have let me do what I needed to do. (Mr. D.\\'s statement to investigators is similar to his statement to Robyn, during the time she was bound, gagged, and fighting him: \"why you fighting me? I told you what I wanted.\" The absence of empathy, and presence of entitlement, leave Mr. D. irritated and perplexed by his victim\\'s actions.)\" Mr. D. next returned to the bed and attempted to insert his penis into the sleeping Gary\\'s rectum. He recognized that Gary was \"trying to let [him] know\" that he wanted to sleep, which further angered him. Mr. D. successfully inserted his penis, however, and the two had anal intercourse for between 30 and 35 minutes.\\nAs Gary\\'s resistance weakened, Mr. D. \"took over and did what [he] wanted to do,\" which was to anally rape him. Gary again began to struggle, and Mr. D. attempted to bind him with ligature. He used a plastic coated wire cord to tie one of Gary\\'s ankles to the bed. He used shoestrings and attempted to tie his hands together, but Gary was able to struggle free. At this point, Gary began to scream, whereupon Mr. D. attempted to gag him with a dark blue towel. He then left the bedroom and went to the kitchen, where he found an electric \"bread dough mixer,\" similar to a rolling pin. He returned to the bedroom and struck Mr. B. twice in the head with this instrument, intending to \"knock him out.\" From behind, Mr. D. grabbed Gary around his neck, with his right arm, and shoved large amounts of petroleum jelly into his nose and mouth to quiet his screams.\\nMr. D. reported to police investigators that Gary died during this struggle, after he had \"pulled up\" on his mouth with his left hand. The coroner\\'s report stated cause of death as asphyxia, either from \"forcible covering of the mouth\" or from \"pressure on the neck.\"\\nRegarding Gary\\'s death, Mr. D. stated \"he just slumped over and stopped moving. I ... decided he must be dead. Then I went back and tried to put him on the bed so I could have more sex with him.\"\\nMr. D. used ligature to bind the body in a fetal position postmortem, to aid his attempt at placing Gary\\'s body back on the bed, so that he could have anal intercourse with the corpse. However, he soon discontinued his attempt, after coworkers called Gary\\'s house to check on his whereabouts, and instead dragged the body into a bedroom closet. He filled four plastic trash bags with the victim\\'s belongings, unplugged the telephone, and attempted to carry the bags from the apartment. The bags broke; Mr. D. then took \"what [he] thought might have [his] name on it,\" and Gary\\'s checkbook and apartment and car keys and exited the apartment.\\nSeveral days after killing Gary, Mr. D. returned to San Diego by bus, intent on \"taking off\":robbing:the apartment. He saw police tape across the door frame of the apartment and thought better of entering. He did, however, use the victim\\'s car keys to steal his vehicle and drove back to Los Angeles.\\nOn 17 May 2001, Mr. D. was arrested in Los Angeles for the theft of Gary\\'s vehicle. On 01 August, while in custody in San Diego after being charged with auto theft (Mr. D. was originally charged with auto theft and murder; the latter charge had been dropped at the time of his confession), Mr. D. approached a correctional counselor and stated \"you\\'re going to go down in history. God is telling me to tell you [of the four murders]\" he had committed.\\nMr. D. also left several living victims, whom he either attempted to drug, rape, or kill. Several days after killing his second victim, in June 2000, Mr. D. resumed sexual encounters with a \"light skinned\" Black male in his early 20\\'s. The two had engaged in sexual intercourse on several occasions in the recent weeks, either at Mr. D.\\'s apartment or at a local park in Los Angeles. After Robyn\\'s death, Mr. D. attempted to drug this man by encouraging him to drink beer into which he had dissolved amitriptyline and by attempting to insert tablets of the medication into his rectum. He reported that although the man drank the beer, he did not become sedated to the point that he could do as he hoped, which was to bind and rape him. When asked whether he would have killed him, Mr. D. reported that he \"probably\" would have tried to \"keep him.\"\\nDuring the same time period, between the time of Robyn\\'s death and the death of Salvador, Mr. D. also drugged a longtime friend of his, Michael T., with whom he had often engaged in consensual anal intercourse, by giving him drug-tainted beer. However, Michael may have been using crack cocaine at the time and sedation did not take effect. If it had, Mr. D. reported that he would have bound and raped Michael.\\nMr. D. had originally met Robyn through a young Black male named Tyrone B., who, according to Mr. D., was either her boyfriend or pimp. During the summer of 2000, prior to Robyn\\'s death, Tyrone broke into Mr. D.\\'s apartment while he was sleeping. It soon became clear to Mr. D. that Tyrone was going to use his apartment as a \"crash pad,\" and had no intention of leaving. In response to this, for a period of one week Mr. D. put amitriptyline in Tyrone\\'s Kool Aid and into the food he gave him. He did not have either consensual or coercive intercourse with Tyrone.\\nIn June or July 2000, in the weeks after he had disposed of Salvador\\'s body, Mr. D. had sex with two Black females, one of whom came to his apartment on several occasions, whom he did not attempt to drug or bind. A third Black female, who refused to have sex with him, also visited his home during this time period. While she was sleeping in his bedroom, Mr. D. dressed in overalls and a woman\\'s white fur coat. He pulled \"greenish\" colored netting over his face and fastened it around his neck. He snuck into the bedroom, intent on binding her with the ligature he had recently begun to collect. Mr. D. accidentally caused a television set to fall over, which caused the woman to stir in bed. Mr. D. \"raced\" out of the room, removed the disguise (\"I [could] say to her, someone was in here, someone tied you up.\") and then reentered the bedroom. He reported that he did not speak to the women and she did not question him regarding who had been in the bedroom. Mr. D. denied ever successfully binding this woman and stated that she simply \"walked away.\"\\nIn the days before the murder of Salvador, in June 2000, and continuing for a period of several months, Mr. D. drugged his lover of four years, Tom B. He reported that \"things about [Tom] were constantly perturbing\" him, including his belief that Tom continued to grieve the death of his former lover (\"face reality, he\\'s dead. What\\'s wrong with me? I\\'m alive\"), that he controlled the amount of time the two spent together, and that he controlled the type of sexual activity the two engaged in. All of these were felt by Mr. D. as humiliating and gave rise to deep resentment. Mr. D. reported that he had reached a point at which he was \"not only trying to be dominant over [Tom], but run his life.\" He told Tom that what God wanted was for him (Tom) to be his lover.\\nAfter the murder of Salvador, Mr. D. began to drug Tom\\'s food, by crushing medication in a small bowl and putting it in food he gave him, then by putting it in boxes of cereal, in milk, ice cream and cream for the coffee, and in the ice Tom used in his drinks. He reported that his goal was to keep Tom constantly drugged, so that he could have sex with him whenever he came to the house. During an argument between the two over the telephone, Mr. D. told Tom that he had killed three people, something which was motivated by a desire to \"make [Tom] obey\" him by frightening him into submission. Mr. D. told Tom that he was continuing to kill and at one point told him that he had murdered 30 people. Regarding this strategy, Mr. D. stated, \"this makes him listen to me.\"\\nMr. D. also considered killing Tom while he slept. He stood above him and thought of twisting a stereo wire around his neck, of striking him in the head with a hammer, and of using ligature to tie him to the bed and killing him there. He denied ever actually attempting any of these. After roughly two months of drugging Tom, Mr. D. told him of his actions. He stated to him \"I didn\\'t want to kill you. I didn\\'t want to drug you, but you\\'re making me do it. If you listen to me and do what I ask and don\\'t make me mad ... I try to tell you how to get along with me, and you won\\'t do it. I don\\'t want to hurt you. I care for you.\" After this, the two apparently reconciled. Soon thereafter, Mr. D. became embittered by a perceived slight from Tom and again began drugging him. This time, Tom recognized what was being done and confronted Mr. D., who again told Tom that if he would simply do as he was asked, he would not have to resort to such measures.\\nMr. D. was born and raised in Wilmington, NC, USA, in 1940, one of six children born to a Baptist Minister father and a homemaker mother. He denied any history of known developmental problems or delays, denied a history of physical or sexual abuse, and denied any juvenile history of arrest or involvement with social services. He described excellent academic achievement and ultimately graduated from a small liberal arts college in Ohio, in 1962.\\nHis psychiatric history is positive for episodes of both depression and mania, during which he would go without sleep, suffer delusions, hallucinations, racing thoughts, grandiosity, and massive agitation. For example, after he had committed his first three murders, Mr. D. traveled to Little Rock, Ark, USA, where he heard the voice of God telling him to \"herald the end of the world.\" He was taken to a psychiatric hospital for a brief period and released without antipsychotic medications. Mr. D. denied, however, active symptoms of either mania or psychosis during the time period of the murders.\\nMr. D. freely reported that he had \"conned and hustled\" all his life, beginning with thefts as a child. His first arrest occurred in 1962, at age 22, when, apparently by accident, he struck another vehicle with his own and killed its occupant. He was charged with second-degree manslaughter and sentenced to six months in jail. In 1963, Mr. D. was arrested for burglary and breaking and entering, which involved thefts from a local high school. In 1968, he was arrested for manslaughter, second-degree burglary, and larceny, in 1976 for grand theft, in 1985 for alien smuggling, in 1990, twice, for disorderly conduct and soliciting a lewd act, and in 1997 for assault with a deadly weapon.\\nMr. D. also reported a prolific and deviant sexual history, with an onset beginning prior to his adolescence. Specific behaviors included exposing himself, public masturbation, fetishism (involving the insertion of objects into his rectum, such as broom handles, carrots, zucchini, water hose, stool leg), and frottage of children and adults of both sexes, as well as staring at the genitals of various animals, including horses. He additionally reported extensive sexual activity with the following animals: chickens, mules, goats, pigs, dogs, cows, and cats. (I was somewhat incredulous regarding Mr. D.\\'s report of sex with animals. However, the specifics of his report appear to lay to rest any doubt. For example, he reported that he disliked penetrating goats because, unlike other animals, the fecal matter inside the anus was hard and crusty and chafed his penis.) He admitted to six previous victims of child molestation, all adolescent males, and to professional sexual misconduct, which involved sexual intercourse with parishioners. He additionally reported massive use of prostitutes, sexual affairs, and anonymous sexual activity with strangers.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 54-year-old female presented to hospital with status epilepticus. She had a previous history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons' Grade II) due to a ruptured aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery that was treated by open clipping surgery when the patient was 44 years old. The initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a low-density area around the right central sulcus, apparently involving the primary motor area. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an intracerebral mass lesion that showed diffusion restriction, hypointensity on T1-weighted images, and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images [Figures 1a-c]. The epilepsy was controlled with medication, but the patient became increasingly drowsy in the days that followed. Repeat CT examinations revealed a hematoma and associated edematous change around the lesion and progressive expansion of the hematoma despite efforts to control blood pressure and treatment by hemostatic agents [Figures 2a and b]. The patient showed considerable neurological decline and semi-emergently underwent hematoma evacuation and decompressive frontotemporal craniectomy.\\nHistopathological sections revealed numerous red blood cells with fibrin and debris and massive infiltration of atypical round blue cells [Figure 3a]. Atypical cells demonstrated clumped nuclear chromatin pattern and eccentric eosinophilic cytoplasm [Figure 3b] suggesting plasma cell origin. Immunohistochemistry study showed CD138 positivity [Figure 3b; inset] and in situ hybridization demonstrated uniform lambda light chain positivity and negative kappa signal, reinforcing the diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasm [Figures 3c and d].\\nFurther imaging studies performed following the diagnosis, including F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and bone scintigraphy, revealed no involvement of other organs. Serum and urine electrophoresis showed no increase in monoclonal protein. Bone marrow biopsy showed plasma cell infiltration of 5%-10%, but without light chain restriction. A final diagnosis of PISP was confirmed. Although the patient was obtunded and showed severe left hemiparesis soon after the surgery, correlating with the focus of the lesion in the right central sulcus, postoperative CT revealed apparent brain decompression [Figure 4a]. She showed a dramatic recovery over time, finally becoming alert and conscious. Postoperative MRI demonstrated extensive near-total resection of the lesion with small residual tumor at the periphery of the cavity [Figures 4b and c]. She underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The lesion showed an excellent response to IMRT, showing a complete disappearance on MRI [Figures 4d and e]. There were no signs of tumor relapse at the 3 years follow-up visit. After intensive rehabilitation, the patient has resumed her daily life as a housekeeper.\",\n",

These lesions initiated as swelling and nodules with severe itching after a precursor of facial palsy, which was treated topically with herbal plaster. The nodules soon developed to progressive ulcers and kept enlarging. She had a medication history with cephalexin and topical dexamethasone in local clinic after suspected with cellulitis and vasculitis, however, without improvement. The girl had no history of immune disorders and diabetes mellitus. There is no family history of lymphoma, vasculitis or metabolic disorders.\\nOn examination, the patient was afebrile. Her blood investigations and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Nodules and ulcers with marked boundary were seen on her right preotic skin (Fig. 1A). Little pus was seen within the ulcers. Biopsy was sampled on the ulcer for bacteriological and fungal culture and for histopathological examination (Fig. 1B).\\nHistopathology revealed vasculitis with thromboses, granulomatous inflammatory infiltration with lymphocytes, macrophages and a few multinucleate giant cells (Fig. 2A). Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) staining showed actinomycetes-like mycelia within vessel walls and thrombi (Fig. 2B) while they could be seen as clusters or chains from the epidermis to the subcutaneous tissues (Fig. 2C and D). Mycological culture was negative for fungi while bacterial culture was positive with creamish white colonies, later identified as bacterium. The bacterium was identified using VITEK II automatic bacteria identification system and the drug susceptibility done by the Kirby-Bauer method. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results were determined in accordance to the United States performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing CLSI-M100.S21. The organism was sensitive to minocycline, meropenem, levofloxacin and ceftazidime, intermediate to ceftriaxone and resistant to cefaclor, cephalexin and aztreonam.\\nThe patient was treated with minocycline at the dosage of 50 mg twice daily and topical mupirocin cream. Ulcers and swelling began to shrink soon after treatment administration and healed within 3 weeks (Fig. 1B and C). She remains well two year after and the facial palsy has never relapsed.\",\n",

Two weeks prior to admission, his fatigue intensified, and the highest temperature reached 39.5C. He had lost 5kg over the past year and had a history of cerebral infarction and hypertension. On examination, the patient was febrile at 38C. His C-reactive protein (CRP) (62.49 mg/dl), procalcitonin (0.213ng/mL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (84 mm/h) were elevated. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed diffusely distributed nodules in both lungs, bilateral bronchiolitis, and tuberculosis could not be excluded. The aortic arch was thickened and the local calcified plaque moved inward, which indicated further aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination (Figure 1). Echocardiography revealed no vegetation in the mitral and aortic valve areas. The chest CTA confirmed multiple atherosclerosis and ulcers, and intermural hematoma in the aortic arch and thoracic aorta. Combined with the medical history, the involvement of tuberculosis in the aorta should be highly suspected (Figure 2). Re-examination of lung CT revealed bronchiole lesions and multiple miliary foci in both lungs, which were larger than one week prior, with pleural effusion, and slightly thickened pleura, suggestive of miliary tuberculosis (Figure 3). The T cell spot test, sputum culture, and sputum GeneXpert test were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and GeneXpert indicated sensitivity to rifampicin. Since disseminated tuberculosis was definite and the patient's disease potentially involved the major thoracic vessels, anti-tuberculosis and steroids were initiated immediately. Methylprednisolone was administered at 40mg/day for 3 days, 20mg/day for 3 days, 8mg/day for 3 days, 4mg/day for 7 days, and then discontinued. Due to liver dysfunction, with alanine aminotransferase of 161U/L and aspartate aminotransferase of 203U/L, a regimen consisting of meropenem 1 g every 8 h, linezolid 0.6 g once daily, amikacin 0.4 g once daily, and levofloxacin 0.5 g once daily was administered. Surgical consultation concluded that no immediate surgical intervention was needed because the aortic wall was not ruptured. On normalisation of liver function, the anti-tuberculosis regimen was changed to isoniazid 0.3 g once daily, rifapentine 0.45 g twice a week, linezolid 0.6 g once daily, ethambutol 0.75 g once daily, levofloxacin 0.5 g once daily. After two weeks of treatment, the patient's body temperature returned to normal, and a re-examination of the lung CT indicated that the lesion was partially absorbed (Figure 4). The patient was discharged and continued to receive oral medications. We planned the follow-up to be weekly initially, gradually transitioning to every two weeks, and then monthly after stabilisation. Routine blood, liver and kidney functions were examined at each follow-up visit. Sputum smears and cultures were performed monthly. Pulmonary CT was re-examined two months later, and aortic CTA was re-examined four months later. The patient tolerated and was compliant with anti-tuberculosis drugs.\",\n",

Three months previously, the patient was admitted to a local hospital for productive cough. Lung CT showed suspicious TB lesions, and T-SPOT was positive. After excluding other diseases, the local hospital started diagnostic anti-tuberculosis treatment consisting of HRZE. The patient took the medication irregularly because of gastrointestinal reaction. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory results were white blood cells, 7.22x109/L; hemoglobin, 122 g/L; platelets, 216 x109/L; CRP, 32.97 mg/dl; and procalcitonin, 0.213ng/mL. The sputum GeneXpert test result was positive and sensitive to rifampicin. Multiple infections and diffuse miliary nodules in both lungs suggested tuberculosis. Thoracic and abdominal aortic CTA examination showed a 51x28 mm2 pseudoaneurysm arising from the lower abdominal aorta, surrounded by a patchy shadow and lymphadenopathy (Figure 5). Combined with the patient's medical history, tuberculous aortic pseudoaneurysm was considered. Emergency digital subtraction angiography was performed after admission, and two coated stents were implanted in the abdominal aorta and iliac artery. Angiography showed that the stents were well- positioned, blood flow was smooth, and a pseudoaneurysm did not develop. The patient was discharged from the hospital 2 days post-operation and received anti-tuberculosis drug treatment, including isoniazid 0.6 g once daily, rifapentine 0.45 g twice a week, ethambutol 0.75 g once daily, pyrazinamide 0.5 g three times daily, and moxifloxacin 0.4 g once daily. Abdominal aortic CTA performed two weeks later revealed that the aneurysm did not recur (Figure 6). Our follow-up plan was consistent with that of the patient in case 1.

       "    'case_text': \"A 40-year-old African-American female with a history of idiopathic familial cardiomyopathy was being evaluated for heart transplantation. Eleven months earlier, she had a CT abdomen performed as part of a cardiac transplant workup which revealed a 1.5 cm enhancing left upper pole renal mass (Figure 1). Given her age, it was possible that this lesion was a benign tumor such as angiomyolipoma or oncocytoma. Therefore, she underwent a CT-guided biopsy of this mass to reconcile the issue prior to heart transplant. This biopsy proved inconclusive due to insufficient tissue, and a second attempt was made under conscious sedation six months prior to LVAD placement. This attempt had to be aborted when she developed severe chest pain and dyspnea preventing adequate sampling. As her ejection fraction worsened, she became progressively dyspneic at rest and received a Heartmate II LVAD (Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA). After much discussion of options, she underwent a CT-guided biopsy under general anesthesia which revealed oncocytic-type cells with fine needle aspiration but again was nondiagnostic. By the time the patient developed severe decompensated heart failure necessitating LVAD placement, the mass had grown to 2.7 cm (Figure 1). \\nThe patient had a past medical history of a nonischemic cardiomyopathy and resultant heart failure manifested by orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, and angina. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a dilated and hypertrophic left ventricle with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10-15% with no significant valvular pathology. Cardiac catheterization revealed the absence of coronary artery disease. She had undergone an implantable cardiac defibrillator due to her diminished ejection fraction, but the device had never discharged. \\nPreoperatively, physical examination revealed a well-nourished, well-developed woman (70 kg, BMI 23.4) who was an active participant in decision making. She carried the LVAD in a satchel and had the expected vital signs for a patient with an LVAD. She had a well-healed scar over her sternum and upper abdomen. Trace pedal edema was present. Laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (estimated glomerular filtration rate 92 mL/min), international normalized ratio (INR) 2.6, and negative urine culture.\\nThe decision was made to perform partial nephrectomy due to the imaging characteristics and growth rate of the mass and the imperative to clear her of a potential renal cell carcinoma in the setting of cardiac transplant listing. Given the need for future immunosuppression, the cardiologist, urologist, and cardiac surgeon felt that maximization of nephrons outweighed the risk of transient bleeding that may have been avoided by performing a radical nephrectomy. Percutaneous ablative approaches were not considered due to tumor location. The cardiology team assisted in medically maximizing the patient preoperatively. The patient was preadmitted to the urology service to facilitate the coordination of care. She was given a gentle bowel preparation of magnesium citrate along with one day of clear liquids. She was maintained off warfarin for 3 days preoperatively with therapeutic-dose enoxaparin which was discontinued the morning of surgery. Her INR on admission was 1.5. Anesthesiology was consulted, and the case was coordinated to ensure that a cardiac anesthesiologist administered general anesthesia. Additionally, the cardiac surgeon was available in the operating room the morning of the surgery. \\nGeneral anesthesia was initiated, and an arterial line was placed with the cardiac surgeon standing by. Extensive padding was utilized with respect to the LVAD as the patient was positioned in the left modified flank position. To avoid excessive pressure points, the kidney rest was not utilized. From a retroperitoneal approach just off the eleventh rib, the kidney was freed and the hilum dissected. At no point did the LVAD present any difficulties. The lesion was not readily identified on gross inspection. Intraoperative ultrasound revealed the mass in the superior pole abutting the collecting system. After injection of 6 mg of mannitol, the renal artery was clamped and then iced. After fifteen minutes of cooling, the capsule was scored with argon plasma coagulation and resection of the mass was performed with the blunt edge of a knife handle. Inferior and deep margins were sent for frozen examination and found to be negative for tumor. The collecting system was closed with 4-0 poliglecaprone suture. Argon plasma coagulation was performed to the resection bed. A Surgicel (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) bolster and Avitene powder (Alcon, Inc., Humacao, Puerto Rico) were placed in the defect. The defect was closed with a 0-chromic suture on a liver needle bolstered with a strip of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pledget both anteriorly and posteriorly. Unclamping was performed for a total clamp time of 59 minutes, and the kidney was observed for 15 minutes. FloSeal (Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, IL) coagulation matrix was applied to the defect and hilum and argon plasma coagulation was performed on some oozing portions of Gerota's fascia. Gerota's fascia was then used to cover the kidney again. A 1.5 cm defect in the pleura was closed with 2-0 polyglactin, and the air was evacuated with a red rubber catheter. A Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the retroperitoneum to bulb suction, and the wound was closed. The patient was extubated and transferred to the cardiac care unit for postoperative care. The patient received at total of 3 units of packed red blood cells and one unit of fresh frozen plasma. Estimated blood loss was 500 mL.\\nPostoperative chest radiograph revealed no pneumothorax. Warfarin and enoxaparin were resumed on postoperative days two and four, respectively. Furosemide was restarted on postoperative day number one. The patient had her diet quickly advanced, and pain was controlled on oral narcotics. She was up and ambulatory, tolerating a low-sodium diet and had all of her heart failure medications restarted. Her Jackson-Pratt drain was removed on postoperative day number 4, and she went home on postoperative day number 6. Final pathology revealed clear cell RCC 2.6 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm with negative margins, Fuhrman grade 3 (high grade). The serum creatinine upon discharge was 0.8 mg/dL (eGFR 103 mL/min).\\nHer managed care consortium mandated postdischarge urologic care be performed at an outside institution. Her postoperative check was unremarkable, but at her 6 month followup she was experiencing worsening left flank pain. CT scan of the abdomen revealed a radiodense material over the superolateral aspect of the left kidney (Figure 2). The final impression stated that there was a retained laparotomy sponge, and the patient was informed that she would require further surgery. This distressed the patient, and she immediately wanted to return to the original surgeon, but the managed care consortium required prior approval which caused a 2-month delay in return to our clinic for evaluation. Upon reevaluation, plain abdominal radiographs were obtained in both the posterior-anterior and oblique orientations. This did not reveal ribbon-like radiopaque material which would be consistent with a retained laparotomy sponge (Figure 3). Reassurance was provided.\",\n",

After informed consent was obtained, all participants underwent six ophthalmologic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp, and fundus examination with dilated pupils to exclude infection or other diseases. Ophthamoscopic findings were recorded by color fundus photography. Optical coherence tomography (OCT, Topcon 3D-1000 Mark II, Tokyo Japan) was used to examine the retinal structure. Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) recording with 3D macular protocol was performed with 6-mm single line scans over the fovea. In detail, the 3D macular protocol consists of a radial-scanning composed of 512x128 scan resolution covering an area of 6x6 mm in the macular region.

Clinical diagnosis was based on the results of the above-mentioned ophthalmologic examinations.\\nBlood samples were obtained by venipuncture and genomic DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol (TIANamp Blood DNA Kit, Tiangen) as described in our previous report. For sequencing, the entire coding region and adjacent intronic sequences of 14 coding regions of the RPE65 gene were amplified by PCR, using the primers in Table 1. PCR products were purified with the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen, CA, USA). All PCR products were bi-directionally sequenced with the dideoxy nucleotide chain terminator technique. Sequencing was performed on an automated sequencer - ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (ABI, USA). The results were assembled and analyzed using the Applied Biosystems Sequencing Analysis 5.2 software. Sequences were aligned with the published cDNA sequences of RPE65 gene (GenBank accession no. NM_000329). We also assessed the potential functional consequences of nucleotide changes using multiple web servers for mutation analysis such as PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping, http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph-2/), SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant, http://sift.jcvi.org/), and Automated Splice Site and Exon Definition Analyses (http://splice.uwo.ca/) with default parameters.\\nThe 293T cell line was purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Wuhan, China) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (FBS, GIBCO), 100 UI/ml penicillin, and 100 microg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The Cells were maintained at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator until confluent, then sub-cultured at 1:3 to 1:10 dilutions using trypsin-EDTA.\\n RPE65 mutated minigenes (pCIneo-m65) were constructed by subcloning the c.1243+2T>A mutation from the patient into pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The wild-type minigene (pCIneo-65), without the c.1243+2T>A mutation, was generated by subcloning the genomic DNA of her father. PCR-amplified exons (11, 12, and 13) of the RPE65 gene were inserted at the EcoRI/SalI restriction enzyme site in pCI-neo vector. Primers and conditions used in the PCR amplification of the inserts were listed in Table 1. The corresponding DNA inserts were confirmed by sequencing.\\nTo analyze the effects of the c.1243+2T>A mutation on splicing in vitro, 293T cells were transfected with RPE65 minigenes. Prior to transfection, cells were seeded with a density of 4.0x105 cells per well in a six-well plate and grown to approximately 80% confluence. RPE65 minigene used in this study was transfected into cells with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) by using 2 microg of DNA per well. After 24 h transfection, cells were serum starved for another 24 h before harvest. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase I (Promega) was used to treat the RNA extract to eliminate DNA contamination. 1.0 microg of treated RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TOYOBO). The exogenous RPE65 minigene transcript was amplified using F1 and R1 primers (Table 1) and the fragment sizes of the wild and mutant PCR products were detected by 2% agarose gels electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. To confirm the nucleotide sequences, the wild and mutant PCR products were purified from the gel and sent for sequencing.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"An 81-year-old woman was admitted to our institution due to prominent bilateral leg oedema and orthopnoea concomitant with 8 kg of weight gain in 3 months after four courses of trastuzumab therapy to treat HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer. She was prescribed with irbesartan 100 mg/day, amlodipine 10 mg/day, febuxostat 10 mg/day, and ibandronate 100 mg/month for hypertension, hyperuricaemia, and osteoporosis, respectively. In September 2021, she underwent mammectomy for Stage IIb breast cancer with high proliferative activity (Ki 67, 63%), negative hormone receptors, and HER-2 overexpression. After surgery, she received adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg) at one dose every 3 weeks. She noted bilateral leg oedema and diarrhoea, 9 weeks after the initiation of anti-HER-2 targeted therapy, which progressively worsened after four courses of treatment. Although she was referred to a general cardiologist, the patient was not diagnosed with CTRCD due to the absence of LV systolic dysfunction [LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 70%] paired with a nonspecific elevation of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 57.3 pg/mL. After 15 weeks of treatment with trastuzumab, dyspnoea, general fatigue, orthopnoea, and anorexia developed, and the patient was eventually diagnosed with heart failure.\\nOn admission, her blood pressure was 176/68 mmHg, heart rate was 69 beats/min, and oxygen saturation was 93% (room air). Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly, jugular vein distension, and prominent bilateral leg oedema. On auscultation, a SIII gallop with no cardiac murmur was observed. On admission, the NT-proBNP concentration was 1525 pg/mL (normal value <125 pg/mL) and the Troponin I level was 32.6 pg/mL (normal value <26.2 pg/mL). Electrocardiography indicated a normal sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block and a nonspecific T-wave inversion on precordial leads. Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed bilateral pleural effusion with significant cardiomegaly (Figure 1AandB), in comparison with the patient's preoperative images which did not show any pleural effusion (Figure 1CandD). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed that LV contraction was preserved without any ventricular remodelling (Figure 2), and the LVEF was calculated at 62% using the bi-plane Simpson's method (see Supplementary material online, Videos S1-S3). Moreover, no significant reduction in GLS was observed compared with results obtained before anti-HER-2 targeted therapy (from -16.5 to -14.6%; relative reduction of 11.5%, Figure 3). In contrast, the left atrial volume index (LAVI) and tricuspid valve regurgitant jet velocity increased from 48.8 to 85.1 mL/m2 and 2.5 to 3.2 m/s, respectively. Doppler echocardiography showed that the transmitral flow pseudonormalized (E/A ratio; from 0.70 to 1.30), e' velocity was reduced (e' septal 5.1 cm/s and e' lateral 6.0 cm/s), E/e' ratio was elevated from 14.3 to 19.1, and pulmonary venous flow changed from a systolic component dominant to a diastolic component dominant pattern (Figure 4), all of which indicated elevated ventricular filling pressure as a result of the development of LV diastolic dysfunction. The patient was consequently diagnosed with decompensated heart failure, and combined treatment with diuretics (torasemide 8 mg/day, spironolactone 25 mg/day, and trichlormethiazide 2 mg/day for 14 days), arteriodilators (amlodipine 5 mg/day and olmesartan 20 mg/day), and venodilators (carperitide 0.125 mug/kg/min for 7 days) was introduced, resulting in the complete disappearance of pleural effusion and peripheral oedema concurrent with a reduction in body weight of 8 kg in over 3 weeks. After successfully achieving volume reduction, the patient underwent cardiac catheter examination to further assess her haemodynamic status (Table 1). Notably, the mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure was elevated to 18 mmHg without any systolic dysfunction or LV dilation, indicating LV diastolic dysfunction.\\nAfter a thorough discussion with her breast surgeon, trastuzumab was discontinued. At discharge, the patient was treated with 3.75 mg of tolvaptan, 200 mg of sacubitril valsartan, 5 mg of amlodipine, 25 mg of spironolactone, and 30 mg of azosemide. At 12 weeks after the interruption of trastuzumab administration, her heart failure symptoms significantly improved to New York Heart Association functional Class I; thus, maintenance medication was reduced to 5 mg of amlodipine and 200 mg of sacubitril valsartan. As shown in Figure 4, Doppler echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function, including E/A of 0.60, E/e' of 14.3, and LAVI of 57.1 mL/m2, significantly improved.\",\n",

The patient had suffered from cough, dyspnea and transient hemoptysis. The patient had also undergone resection for a pelvic lymphangioma two months previously. At that time, pelvic MRI had demonstrated the presence of a large cystic mass with many septations and no involvement of the adjacent organs in the pelvis (Fig. 1A).\\nA physical examination revealed no vital sign abnormalities. Levels of pro-BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) and D-dimer were mildly elevated to 196.2 pg/ml (normal range, 0-97.3 pg/ml) and 486 microg/L (normal range, 0-324 microg/L), respectively. However, peak serum levels of creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB), troponin T, other blood chemistry findings and blood counts were within normal ranges. An initial plain chest radiograph demonstrated reduced volume of the right hemithorax and a paucity of pulmonary vascular markings on the right side (not shown). Perfusion lung scanning using Tc-99m macro-aggregated albumin identified the absence of perfusion throughout the right lung, indicating occlusion of the right main pulmonary artery (Fig. 1B). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed for the evaluation of persistent dyspnea demonstrated the presence of a mobile echogenic tumor adhering to chordae and papillary muscles of the tricuspid valve at the right atrium and right ventricle chordae. The tumor extended from the IVC into the right heart and caused tricuspid regurgitation (Fig. 1C, D). Chest CT confirmed the presence of an elongated non-enhanced mass in the right chambers of the heart and in the IVC, with extension to the right distal pulmonary artery (Fig. 1E, F). A median sternotomy was performed and the tumor was resected. Despite the presence of a neoplastic thrombus in the IVC, excision was straightforward except for resections of an adhesive chordal portion and a web-like tumor, which occluded the right distal pulmonary artery (Fig. 1G). Postoperative recovery was excellent, and the patient was extubated the day after surgery and was discharged to the general ward on day-2 postoperatively. At seven days postoperatively, the patient underwent follow-up TTE that demonstrated the absence of any residual mass inside the cardiac chambers (data not shown). The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged at day-15 postoperatively.\\nSpecimens from the IVC, right heart and right pulmonary artery were all diagnosed as cavernous lymphangiomas without features of malignancy. Grossly, the contiguous 29 cm long mass was a well-circumscribed, gray-white tumor with a soft, rubbery consistency (Fig. 1G). Based on the histology, the tumor consisted of dilated lymphatic channels with variable wall thicknesses (Fig. 1H). Lumina were lined with attenuated, bland endothelial cells. A few lymphocytes and rare lymphoid follicles were observed in the surrounding stroma, and a small number of disorganized bundles of smooth muscle were present in the walls of larger channels. Atypical features, such as, endothelial tufting, atypia and mitotic activity of lymphatic endothelium were absent, and based on immunohistochemical staining, tumor cells were positive for lymphatic vessel marker D2-40 (Fig. 1H, insert) and CD31.\",\n",

On clinical vaginal examination, a brown pigmented flat lesion of 2 x 2 cm was seen on the posterior vaginal wall just beyond the vaginal introitus. The lateral and anterior walls of the vagina did not show any abnormalities. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was found. Her medical history included only hypertension. She was a non-smoking female, gravida 4:para 4, with four vaginal deliveries. Her surgical history included a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and an appendectomy. Her family history showed her mother died of metastatic breast cancer.\\nA primary excisional biopsy was performed, and pathology reports showed a malignant melanoma with a minimal diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 8 mm. There was no lympho-vascular or perineural invasion. The margins were positive on the lateral and distal sides. The patient was subsequently referred to our tertiary cancer center for robotic oncological surgery. Preoperative imaging involved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound scan of the groins, and FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. All of these investigations did not reveal any lymphadenopathy nor distant metastases. To exclude primary melanoma from other sides such as ocular melanoma, an ophthalmologic investigation was performed, which did not reveal any pathology. On the basis of these investigations, a primary melanoma from another side was excluded. The patient was clinically staged according to the 2009 International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for vaginal cancer as FIGO-stage I (cT1bN0M0) and according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; eighth edition) for (cutaneous) Melanoma Staging as clinical stage IB (T4bN0M0, with T4: >4 mm thickness and b: with ulceration). The patient was planned for a combined vaginal and robotic en bloc resection of the total vagina and uterus, in order to achieve a complete resection of the vaginal melanoma, together with a pelvic sentinel lymph node dissection.\\nThe robot da Vinci Xi platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with near-infrared fluorescence imaging (Firefly  technology) was used. As a fluorescent agent, indocyanine green (ICG: Verdye 25 mg, Diagnostic Green GmbH  , 85609 Aschheim-Dornach, Germany) was used at a concentration of 1.9 mg/mL H2O. A total of 2 mL ICG was used for the patient and 0.5 mL was injected, just beyond the vaginal introitus, in the submucosa of the anterior, posterior, and lateral vaginal walls.\\nA robotic pelvic bilateral sentinel lymph node dissection was performed prior to the en bloc resection of the uterus and total vagina (Figure 1).\\nVaginal approach: circular incision, with diathermy, of the vaginal mucosa just inside the vaginal introitus.\\nSubsequent dissection of the distal 3 cm of vagina, with releasing the vagina anteriorly from the urethra, posteriorly from the rectum, and laterally on both sides from the bulbocavernosus muscle.\\nRobotic approach: sealing/cutting of the round ligaments with an opening of the retroperitoneal space at the pelvic side walls.\\nUreterolysis: traction medially on the peritoneum of the broad ligament with subsequent ureterolysis, while keeping the mesoureter intact, down to the level of the crossing with the uterine arteries.\\nSealing of the uterine arteries at its origin, close to the internal iliac artery, and lateral from the ureters.\\nTraction of the bladder peritoneum toward the anterior abdominal wall (with robotic Cadiere forceps) and sealing/cutting of the uterine arteries on the uterus, both ascending and descending branch down to the vaginal edges.\\nPreparation for the robotic vaginal dissection: with fenestrated grasper, via the assistant trocar, traction of the uterus cranially, and with the robotic Cadiere foceps traction of the bladder peritoneum toward the anterior abdominal wall.\\nAnterior/lateral robotic vaginal dissection: dissection and dividing of the vagina from the bladder anteriorly and paravaginal tissues laterally, with robotic bipolar forceps and unipolar scissor, down to the level of the vaginal dissection.\\nPosterior robotic vaginal dissection: with the robotic Cadiere forceps elevation of the uterus against the pubis; opening of the posterior peritoneum with unipolar scissor and sealing/cutting of the sacro-uterine ligaments; dissecting the rectovaginal septum with releasing the total vagina from the rectum down to the level of the initial vaginal dissection; removal of the total vagina and uterus vaginally.\\nClosure of the vaginal introitus: approximation of the bulbocavernosus muscle on both sides toward the midline with Vicryl 1 sutures, below the level of the urethral orifice. Closure of the skin above the bulbocavernosus muscle with Ethilon 2/0 Donati stitches.\\nThe 10 surgical steps of the combined vaginal and robotic en bloc total vaginectomy and hysterectomy were as follows, with the patient placed in the lithotomy position (Figure 1): The methylene blue test showed a small bladder lesion at the top of the bladder, which was closed with two single sutures Monocryl 3/0. The estimated blood loss was approximately 300 cc. The rectal serosa was intact. The total combined vaginal and robotic operation time was 195 min. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Hemoglobin levels did not drop below 9.8 g/dL. C-reactive protein levels remained low postoperatively (maximum of 13 mg/L). The patient was discharged on day 5. The bladder catheter was removed during an outpatient visit on day 10. She had no complaints. The pathology report showed a residual malignant melanoma of 6.23 mm in width with an invasion thickness of 0.8 mm; the combined dimensions of the residual melanoma and the initial excision biopsy (20 x 8mm, with ulceration) provide a final TNM stage as pT4bN0 (AJCC Stage IB) or FIGO stage I. There was no ulceration in the residual melanoma, perineural and lympho-vascular invasion were absent, and there was no invasion in the cervix. The surgical margins were free. All bilateral sentinel lymph nodes showed negative results. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for Sox10, PRAME, and MIB1. P53 showed a wild-type expression. PHH3 did not show a clear mitosis. ATRX showed a weak but preserved expression in tumor cells. No BRAF mutation was found; however, a mutation was found in the KIT gene (exon 11). The suggested multidisciplinary advice was adjuvant treatment with immunotherapy and an intravenous administration of Pembrolizumab (PD-1 receptor blocker) for 1 year. During follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrent disease clinically or on imaging 4 months after surgery.',\n",

Although initial anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis and right hip axial views were performed, no signs of fractures, aseptic loosening or implant damage were diagnosed by the attending trauma surgeons (Fig. 2). Two weeks after surgical treatment of the ankle fracture, the patient noticed a sudden \"cracking\" sound in his right hip, as well as shortening of the right lower limb. Interestingly, the patient had no relevant pain.\\nDespite this sign, he had no further medical observation or secondary radiographic evaluation over the next month. In the following months he was increasingly troubled by back pain and an unpleasant cracking \"phenomenon\" with movement of his right hip; no severe hip pain or associated direct thigh pain was mentioned at any time. Further conventional radiographs, in two planes, more than a year after the initial radiographs, revealed a completely destroyed multifragmented ceramic head (Fig. 3). A thorough clinical examination revealed a shortening of 2 cm of the right lower limb, yet the patient was able to walk without relevant pain.\\nIntraoperatively, extensive damage of the ceramic head and correlating taper junction of the femoral neck was found (Figs. 4, 6, 7). Concomitantly, there was severe debris-related metallosis throughout the entire joint (Fig. 5). The intervention consisted of conversion of the short cementless CFP stem to a cementless revision stem and an acetabular cup revision to a ceramic-ceramic bearing surface (Alloclassic stem and Allofit-IT acetabulum with Delta Ceramic Inlay, Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana, USA and Ceramtec, Plochingen, Germany). Meticulous debridement of all affected soft tissues and extensive lavage was additionally performed.\\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, with radiographs revealing a correct position and articulation of the cementless implant (Fig. 8). A 12 month postoperative inquiry was performed and the Oxford Hip Score obtained, with both indicating satisfactory joint function.

Consequently, the patient presented to our clinic complaining of ED. As a result, he was started on Tadalafil and Alprostadil intracorporeal injections for 3 years but without satisfying erections. Thus, the choice of inserting a 3-piece penile prosthesis was discussed with the patient and he agreed. In June 2018, the patient underwent penile prosthesis insertion (Coloplast Titan ). Intraoperatively, severe corporal fibrosis was noted and dilated successfully. The procedure went uneventfully without complications. The patient was admitted for pain control and a 4-day course of intravenous Vancomycin and Gentamycin. During the hospital stay, no scrotal swelling or tenderness were noted, and the patient was discharged on Ciprofloxacin plus Cephalexin for 14 days. A month later, the patient presented with a painless scrotal swelling. However, no signs of systematic infection were detected. Local examination revealed an intact surgical scar with no overlying skin changes or discharge. Additionally, a small left scrotal confined collection was felt. Scrotal ultrasonography revealed 5.6 x 3.3 x 3.9 cm scrotal hematoma surrounding the prosthesis pump (Fig. 1). As there were no signs of infection and the device was functioning properly, the patient was managed conservatively with scrotal support and he was instructed not to use the device until the resolution of the hematoma. On the following visit, hematoma decreased in size, prosthesis recycling was performed successfully, and the patient was allowed to resume sexual intercourse. Two months later, the patient presented with a painless large scrotal swelling with the inability to use the pump due to the surrounding collection. On examination, there were no signs of local or systemic infection. A large, painless and firm scrotal swelling at the site of the pump was palpated. A pelvic MRI showed a 6.4 x 3.6 x 3.9 cm scrotal collection with findings suggestive of an underlying infectious process (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The choice of elective scrotal exploration with a possible exchange of the implant was discussed with the patient, and he agreed after all risks and benefits were explained.\\nUnder general anesthesia, a penoscrotal incision was made. The pump was covered by a fibrous layer which was incised sharply. Upon opening the capsule surrounding the pump, blood poured out and a sample was taken for culture (Fig. 4). Complete hematoma evacuation and excision of the cavity was done, and the device was recycled successfully multiple times with no evidence of malfunction (Fig. 5). Accordingly, the decision was made not to replace the device. Vigorous scrotal washout was done using 1-liter of antimicrobial solution (Vancomycin and Gentamycin), povidone and hydrogen peroxide. Then, a new space was created for the pump in the right scrotal side. Eventually, size 10 French Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted, and the scrotal layers were closed using vicryl suture.\\nThe intraoperative culture came back positive for Staphylococcus Lugdunensis, so the patient was shifted from intravenous Vancomycin and Gentamycin to oral Clindamycin 600 mg three times a day for 3 weeks. The patient was discharged on day 7 postoperatively in a good condition. The patient is being followed up postoperatively for 2 months now with no evidence of hematoma recurrence or prosthesis malfunction.',\n",

Dip test of the urine revealed absence of blood or protein.\\nIn the year prior to referral, only limited blood tests were available, revealing no evidence of an inflammatory process with C-reactive protein (CRP) <1 mg/L (reference range 0-20 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 2 mm/h (reference range 0-10 mm/h); normal complement C3 and C4 levels; and negative lupus anticoagulant and rheumatoid factor. Her full blood count, renal function, liver function, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were all within normal limits, as was her urine protein:creatine ratio. There were, however, no recent blood tests available due to severe needle phobia. This significantly affected our ability to assess the patient fully to exclude vasculitis as the cause of the unusual skin rash and for any serological evidence of an ongoing inflammatory or autoimmune process driving vasculitis. However, our clinical assessment was that these findings could also be part of an inherited vasculopathy. Based on that, the pre-test probability of systemic vasculitis was low, and gave us confidence that we had time to work with the child and family to initially avoid invasive investigations in the context of her extreme procedural anxiety.\\nOn further scrutiny of the past medical history, we noted an antenatal history of mitral regurgitation (which had resolved by 30 weeks' gestation). This had prompted an echocardiogram three months prior to her first clinic appointment, which unexpectedly showed aortic root dilatation, with aortic annulus 18.8 mm (z-score +0.44), sinus of Valsalva 32.2 mm (z-score +3.99), ST junction of 22.9 mm (z-score +2.45) and proximal ascending aorta 23 mm (z-score 2.14). The patient had also previously been investigated for mild hypermobility but had a normal skeletal survey, with no evidence of skeletal dysplasia or other skeletal abnormality, and she had normal arm span/height ratio, with height on the 70th percentile and weight on the 40th percentile.\\nSpecific clinical screening for MFS revealed a systemic score of 0/20, while the median systemic score in patients with MFS is 7/20. However, in recognition of the limitations of the systemic score, especially in childhood, the revised Ghent-2 criteria from 2010 place more emphasis on the cardinal features of ectopia lentis and aortic root dilatation, alongside molecular genetic testing. It is also of note that while skin striae are the only cutaneous manifestation listed in the revised Ghent-2 systemic criteria, other unusual skin rashes like those seen in our case have been reported. A skin biopsy or further investigation under general anesthesia was offered but not performed due to the patient's severe procedural anxiety.\\nWith the severe needle-phobia hampering our ability to repeat any blood tests or biopsy the skin lesions, we focused on DNA analysis via a salivary sample using a targeted gene panel of 214 genes, designed to screen for monogenic forms of vasculitis, and genetic vasculopathies that are known to mimic vasculitis of the young, as described previously by our group. The full list of genes in this panel are provided as Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table S1). This targeted gene panel revealed a frameshift variant in the fibrillin 1 gene: FBN1, NM_000138, c.1211delC, p.P404Hfs*44 het. Sanger sequencing results of parental samples were consistent with the variant having arisen de novo in the proband (Figure 1D). This variant is not listed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), there are two entries in ClinVar where submitting laboratories have classified this variant as either pathogenic or likely pathogenic, and the same frameshift caused by a different nucleotide deletion has been previously described in MFS. The variant is expected to result in either an abnormal truncated protein product or loss of protein from this allele through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This allowed us to conclude that this genotype is pathogenic (Class 5) despite lack of experimental functional data directly probing the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity. Loss-of-function variants are a known mechanism in MFS and haploinsufficiency has been associated with a more severe aortic phenotype, although both haploinsufficiency and dominant negative effects have been implicated in pathogenesis of MFS.\\nThe patient was first seen in our clinic in June 2019 and received the genetic diagnosis in December 2019. During close clinical follow-up until May 2023, no features of systemic vasculitis emerged. In January 2020, due to aortic root dilatation in context of MFS with aortic annulus 19.9 mm (z-score +1.84) and sinus of Valsalva 32.2 mm (z-score +3.75), ST junction 21.83 mm (z-score +1.79) and ascending aorta 22.4 mm (z-score +1.59), she was commenced on treatment with losartan and atenolol at standard doses; the mother reported that this was associated with complete resolution of the cutaneous lesions within three weeks. The patient remained clinically well until February 2022, when she developed recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces. These were managed with bilateral bullectomy and pleurodesis and to date (May 2023), no other features of MFS have emerged.\",\n",

She had secondary education, was divorced, and raised by herself her 10-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son with autism spectrum disorder. She remained unemployed and used care allowance. Emma came from a very religious family and was raised by mother and grandparents. No one used psychiatric treatment in her mother's family and there was no information about that from the father's side. Her father was born in a Nazi concentration camp and after the war he relied on financial compensation. He was much older than Emma's mother, aggressive, and abused alcohol. He left the family before Emma's first birthday, and reappeared every 6 or 12 months thereafter. According to Emma, her mother was controlling and turned her against her father. Emma also perceived herself as a solution for her mother's pain after miscarrying a child shortly before Emma had been conceived.\\nEmma had a good relationship with her maternal grandfather, who was supportive and a model of morality and piety. He led her to develop her interest in religion when she was in primary school, but he died when she was 15. Around that time her problems with aggressive or auto-aggressive behavior started, as well as attention seeking by unlawful behavior and breaking school regulations. She became rebellious, and frequently quarreled with her mother who tried to control her social life and sexuality, before running away from home for a year to live in squats, abusing alcohol and drugs, and engaging in risky sexual behavior for money. She was sexually abused under the influence of substance a few times. In adulthood, she lived abroad for almost 10 years, earning money by providing sexual services. During that time she also experienced rape and threats. As she never had close friends, she only used support from priests who, based on her life history, believed she was possessed. She was first exorcized a few times in charismatic groups at age 16. In adulthood, she regularly used deliverance ministries and individual exorcisms according to Roman Catholic ritual for a few years, but her problems and symptoms persisted.\\nShe had elevated levels of somatoform and psychoform dissociation (respectively, measured with SDQ-20 and DESR-PL).

She had a height of 155 cm and a weight of 46.5 kg. Examination of the vulva revealed an extremely thin mucous membrane, hyperemia, a slight lowering of the pubic arch, and a small, bright-red, defect-like lesion on the mucosal surface of the medial labia minora. The vaginal orifice was stenosed with a diameter of 1 cm. There was vaginal stenosis with disappearance of the mucosal folds. The urethral orifice was less than 1 mm in diameter. Ring-like stenosis was present at the 9 o'clock position of the upper two-thirds of the vagina. A small speculum was unable to expose the cervix (Figure 3A). The pH of the vaginal secretions was 5.4.

The pathological sections were considered to have squamous epithelial mucosal tissue, partial epithelial atrophy, partial simple hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and incomplete keratosis, scattered focal infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the superficial dermis with formation of lymphoid follicles, and small vessel hyperplasia (Figure 5A and B). These results were consistent with an inflammatory lesion.\\nIn view of the symptoms of urinary difficulty and the discovery of a pinpoint urethral orifice on examination, urine flow rate was measured at the Urology Department and found to be 5.2 mL/s (normal value: >18 mL/s) (Figure 6A).\\nAfter multidisciplinary discussion of the case between the Departments of Dermatology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Urology at our hospital, the patient was diagnosed as having LP with multiple system involvement including the scalp, mouth, vagina, and urethra. Since the patient had not tolerated the adverse side effects of corticosteroid therapy during previous treatment and had fertility requirements, she was treated with oral cyclosporine A (125 mg/day) combined with physical dilatation of the urethra, and this resulted in an increase in urine flow rate to 11.5 mL/s (Figure 6B).\\nAfter one month of drug therapy (January 8, 2015), the patient resumed her sex life and had sexual intercourse for 10 min without serious dyspareunia. In addition, the oral ulcer had improved, and urination was less problematic than before treatment but more difficult than just after urethral dilatation. Physical examination revealed that the mucosa of the labia minora was smooth, the frenulum labiorum pudendi was lightly chapped and the vaginal elasticity had improved, although the upper vagina still had a ring-like narrowing and no folds (Figure 3B).\\nAt the 3-month follow-up, the patient reported only mild pain during sexual activity, but a feeling of dryness persisted. There was no change in urination, and no oral mucosal lesions were present. The patient was treated with cyclosporine A for a total of 6 months, and this resulted in the vulvar lesions essentially disappearing (as assessed by gynecological examination), although the symptoms did not notably improve during the latter 3 months. The patient discontinued the medication due to economic pressures.\\nThe patient was followed-up annually with gynecological examinations for a further 4 years. During the 4-year follow-up period, the patient reported that her psychological stress had been relieved and that symptom aggravation had not occurred. In July 2018 (the last outpatient follow-up), the patient reported a satisfactory sex life and a slight decrease in urine flow rate, but no treatment was needed. Oral mucosal lesions had not re-appeared. Gynecological examination showed that the mucosa of the medial labia minora was slightly reddened, smooth, and without defects, the elasticity of the vaginal mucosa was good, and two fingers could be accommodated (see Figure 3C).

Anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and elevated ALP (alkaline phosphatase) (884 U/L) and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) (356 U/L) levels were recorded as abnormal laboratory results. Chronic lung findings as bronchiectasis and atelectasis were observed in chest X-ray (CXR). Portal hypertension via portal Doppler US and biopsy proven perivenular fibrosis and congestion of liver were detected. Investigations revealed no significant results confirming any metabolic diseases including the early suspicion of Gaucher\\'s disease. Pancytopenia was considered to be associated with splenomegaly related to portal hypertension and improved in follow-up. The quantitative oxidative burst activity (\"Phagoburst\" kit, Glycotope, Biotechnology) was abnormal (FMLP 0.94%, PMA 4.10%, and opsonized E. Coli 4.89%; normal values 1-10%, 98-100%, and 97-100%, resp.). He was diagnosed as CGD which was later confirmed with molecular analysis revealing a \"hemizygous X-linked c.1609T>C mutation\" in CYBB gene-gp91phox.\\nProphylactic antifungal and antibacterial medications and interferon gamma-1b were started although patient adherence to the treatment and follow-up visits was very poor. He was admitted with the complaints of fever, cough, respiratory distress, and stomachache, two years after the diagnosis. He had bilateral fine crackles with decreased lung sounds in the left basal region, hepatosplenomegaly (spleen 2 cm, liver 3 cm palpable), and a swelling inferior to sternum with dimensions of 4 x 5 cm in abdomen. He had iron deficiency and chronic disease anemia, high acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein (CRP) 11.2 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 90 mm/hour), and minimally elevated ALP (133 U/L) and GGT (36 U/L) levels in laboratory evaluation. CXR revealed an expanded pneumothorax within left hemithorax. There were chronic lung findings relevant to recurrent infections in addition to pneumothorax in thorax CT (Figure 1). Ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin, and fluconazole were started empirically. There was a 7 x 4 cm heterogenous mass lesion in liver with cystic areas in center which was a multiloculated abscess in abdominal US that was subsequently confirmed with abdominal CT (Figure 2). There were multiple lymph nodes in periportal, peripancreatic, and para-aortic regions. Interventional radiology department inserted a drainage catheter to the abscess and a pigtail catheter to the left hemithorax. Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin sensitive) grew in the culture from abscess material. Antibiotics were replaced with cephazolin and rifampicin and a transient response was achieved. However, control CT 5 days after catheter placement showed no significant change in the dimensions of abscess (Figure 2). Surgical treatment was considered due to the multiloculated nature of the abscess and ongoing fever. Irregular abscess wall on anterior liver surface was dissected, and granulomatous changes in peripheral tissues were noted during the operation. Intraoperative US showed multiple small granulomas in liver. Fever did not recur followed by decreases in CRP to 1.4 mg/dL and in ESR to 22 mm/hr, after the operation. Pathologic findings were consistent with necrotizing granuloma and abscess in liver. He was discharged with supportive treatment and appropriate antibiotics two weeks after the operation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was planned as the disease progressed despite the supportive measures. He had a full match donor but the family did not accept HSCT as a treatment option.',\n",

She was hospitalized for pneumonia at the fifteenth day of birth followed by recurrent and treatment resistant cervical lymphadenopathies with high CRP levels. She was the first child of a consanguineous family. She had bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies and maculopapular skin eruptions over body and legs on admission. Laboratory investigations revealed anemia, leukocytosis, high CRP level (12 mg/dL), and hypergammaglobulinemia. Histological findings of the skin biopsy and lymph node excision were reported as granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, respectively. Meanwhile, oxidative burst activity (\"Phagoburst\" kit, Glycotope, Biotechnology) was insufficient (FMLP 9%, PMA 9%, and opsonized E. Coli 4%; normal values 1-10%, 98-100%, and 97-100%, resp.) leading to a probable diagnosis of CGD later confirmed with mutation analysis disclosing a \"homozygous autosomal recessive c.369 + 1G>A mutation\" in CYBA gene-  p22phox.\\nShe was admitted again with tachypnea with coarse lung sounds relevant to acute pneumonia at 30 months of age. She had anemia (Hb: 8.9 g/dL), leukocytosis (16800/mm3), and high CRP (3 mg/dL) and ESR (60 mm/hr) levels. CXR showed bilateral extensive infiltrations especially prominent in left upper lobe (Figure 3). Thorax CT revealed pneumonic consolidations with calcifications (Figure 3). These findings were interpreted in favor of tuberculosis (TB) although objective mycobacterial evidence was absent (PPD 9 mm, gastric fluid acid-fast bacilli and PCR negative). Three-drug combination therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide) was initiated. Echocardiography showed pericardial thickening which was also evaluated as TB sequela.\\nDespite treatment, her clinical condition worsened in a two-month period. Extensive lymph node enlargements in mediastinum and around pericardium reaching to 3 cm in diameter, some showing central necrosis, were recorded in the new thorax CT (Figure 3). During hospitalization, she developed right congestive heart failure signs, fine crackles in lungs, and increased oxygen need. Echocardiography showed findings compatible with pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and constrictive pericarditis (Figure 4). Emergency pericardiectomy was performed. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured in pericardial fluid and blood Aspergillus antigen was positive for the first time. Parenteral caspofungin and voriconazole infusions were initiated in combination for antifungal therapy. Histological interpretation of the pericardial sample was reported as granulomatous pericarditis.\\nFever and respiratory distress continued and thorax CT revealed an abscess of 4.5 x 1.7 cm diameter in left lung inferior lobe, two weeks after the pericardiectomy (Figure 5). The abscess was drained and drainage material culture was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus (Figure 5). Granulocyte transfusions were applied for the subsequent days and fever subsided gradually in a few days. She was discharged with oral voriconazole after her condition stabilized with parenteral antifungal therapy for one month. Blood Aspergillus antigen was still positive in low titers.\\nTwo weeks later, she was brought to emergency department with left hemiparesis, left central facial paralysis, and fever. Glasgow Coma Scale was 12, motor strength was 2/5 in left upper and lower extremities, and left plantar response was abnormal in neurological examination. A hypodense lesion at the level of right basal ganglia was interpreted as acute ischemic infarction in cranial CT (Figure 6). Diffusional restriction consistent with acute ischemia in right basal ganglia and cerebral, cerebellar millimetric enhancing foci consistent with aspergillosis were reported in cranial and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 6). In MR angiography, right middle cerebral artery was occluded from M2 segment to end which was also associated with Aspergillus infection (Figure 6). Voriconazole, amphotericin B, vancomycin, and meropenem were started. Intravenous immunoglobulin, 1 gr/kg/day, was given for two days. Fever was controlled and her general condition improved. Acetylsalicylic acid treatment was commenced to prevent further infarction.\\nNeurological findings regressed with decreased facial asymmetry and increased motor strength in the follow-up. Parenteral antifungal treatment was continued for two months and she was discharged with oral voriconazole and negative blood Aspergillus antigen. The ischemic lesion in the right basal ganglia showed chronicity and appeared as cystic encephalomalacia; most of the cerebral/cerebellar foci were smaller than before and some disappeared in the control MRI five months after the initial evaluation (Figure 7). Due to the severe course of her disease, HSCT was planned and due to the lack of full matched relative, an unrelated donor search is initiated.',\n",

He had a history of surgical removal of the pigmented nonhealing ulcerated lesion in left lower eyelid 9 years ago, reported as basal cell carcinoma.\\nAt presentation, the unaided visual acuity was 6/18 and best corrected visual acuity was 6/9 in right eye. The rest of the findings in the right eye was normal. In left orbit examination, there was a large fungating, foul-smelling, ulcerated mass with wound extension up to eyebrow superiorly and malar region inferiorly and up to lateral canthus and medial canthus. Necrotic tissues along with crusts and scabs were present within and at the wound edges along with granulation tissues. There was intense foul smell and purulent discharge with multiple maggots crawling over the wound. The left eyeball was not seen.\\nInitially, around 100 maggots were manually removed and debridement of necrotic tissues was done under local anesthesia (Figure 1). Exposed bone edges of lateral wall of the orbit were noticed after sterile dressing. The patient was started on oral antibiotics and analgesics. He also received single dose of oral Ivermectin (9 mg, 200 mcg/kg) following which the patient had significant relief from pain and discomfort. Dead maggots were easily removed from the wound and the rapid wound healing ensued. The left socket was covered with healthy granulation tissues and was maggot-free within few days.\\nThe CT scan of orbit and paranasal sinuses revealed left anophthalmic socket with soft tissue lesion in left orbit and maxillary sinus along with erosion of orbital floor and lateral wall of the orbit (Figure 2). However, orbital apex and cranial fossa were not involved. Nasal endoscopy revealed only streaks of mucopurulent discharge in maxillary sinus. Punch biopsy was done from the wound margins and central region and sent for histopathological evaluation. The biopsy report revealed basal cell carcinoma invasive into the left orbit.\\nHence, the patient underwent uneventful extended exenteration of the left orbit and the socket was covered by transposition of myocutaneous flap from forehead and temporal region (Figure 3). The postoperative period was also uneventful and patient recovered well.

The patient's chest X-ray, ultrasound abdomen, and eosinophil counts were normal. The patient was started on dexamethasone, leviteracetem, and albendazole and scheduled for surgery.\\nA frontoparietal craniotomy was performed. There was significant dural tension, and a c-shaped durotomy was done which revealed a huge hydatid cyst extending toward the lateral ventricle [Figure 2a]. A soft rubber catheter was inserted between the brain parenchyma and the cyst capsule (Dowling's technique); a cleavage plane was established using warm hypertonic saline and the cyst was delivered unruptured [Figure 2d]. Numerous daughter cysts were then identified which were carefully delivered unruptured using the same technique [Figure 2b and c]. We were able to remove all of the 19 cysts without rupturing the cyst capsule this way. An endoscope was used after removing all the cysts to make sure that none of the daughter cysts was left behind. The cavity was copiously irrigated with hypertonic saline and hydrogen peroxide.

(born in 1999, in Maglaj, Bosnia and Herzegovina) was admitted into the General Hospital Tesanj (Tesanj, Bosnia and Herzegovina) with a severe headache, mental confusion, high fever, and a cough. Neither the patient\\'s own medical history nor that of her family contained details of any specific disorder. Both her birth weight (3850 gr) and her birth length (58 cm) were considered normal. Prior to that admission to the hospital, she manifested no cognitive disabilities. She was diagnosed with having epilepsy with mental disorientation and she was treated with phenobarbitone, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine. Then, in 2010, she started having seizures: they would begin with nausea, impaired vision, and a loss of consciousness. During the seizures, her eyes were tightly closed and she exhibited no twitching of her legs nor her arms. After ten to thirty min, the patient would regain consciousness and would complain of feeling cold at the terminal part of extremities. Additionally, she would feel pain in her ankles, with bruising joints, after which the pain would progress towards her toes, followed by swelling and reddening. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient\\'s head showed no apparent changes in the structure of the patient\\'s brain. \\nDuring the third year following the onset of her symptoms and her first seizure, the patient experienced a different type of \"seizure\" during her sports class: she began to walk aimlessly and insecurely, with tottering, she had a fixed gaze, pale face, and was rambling (calling a friend by her name over and over again). However, she did not lose her balance and did not fall. In addition, she manifested no twitching of extremities. That particular \"seizure\" lasted for about ten minutes, after which she regained consciousness. However, following that particular seizure the patient failed to re-establish her previous state: she had absent gaze, difficulty using cutlery, she lost her sense in space and time, and she did not recognize her parents and people she previously knew around her. On one occasion, she had a generalized epileptic seizure.\\nIn July 2011, the patient experienced a sudden loss of consciousness, and she lost her balance and fell, her body becoming rigid and cyanotic, without twitching of the extremities, while her eyes were closed. At the time, the patient\\'s pupils were round, symmetrical, with proper response to light. Following recovery from this seizure, the patient had difficulty walking independently; she walked aided and her walk was atactic (suggesting a lack of muscle coordination), with significant deviation to the left. She also had difficulty in performing a walk on heels and toes and could not walk in a straight line. Dystonia of torso and extremities was present. Romberg was unstable, with a deviation to the left. Finger to nose test was abnormal (suggesting dysmetria). Gross motor abilities test was in order. Muscle tendon reflex (MTR) was symmetrical, live. Right, Babinski sign was positive. Lumbar puncture test, as well as findings of ophthalmologists and cardiologists, were without noticeable pathologies. Hormonal status of the patient was within the normal range. An electroencephalogram test (EEG) showed continuously discharging of the high voltage Delta Theta activity with interposed sharp and steep waves of high voltage and paroxysmal high voltage spikes, as well as multiple spike-and-wave discharges. During the stay at the hospital, the EEG registration did not change. The patient was subjected to additional MRI scans which revealed no apparent changes in the brain structure. Seizures were classified as visually partial twitches, eventually becoming myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic twitching. At this time, the patient exhibited evident cognitive deterioration. No cranial nerve deficits were present, but rapid irregular myoclonic twitches that were palpable at rest were present and were increased by voluntary movements of the upper limbs. There was no sign of Babinski. The patient was able to cooperate with the doctor during the examination. In addition, the patient was decelerated with a little verbal and motor activity.\\nGenetic testing was carried out in Genoa, Italy, on Mar 2013, from the DNA that was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood. Analysis of exons 1-4 of the EPM2A gene (NM_005670) and the single exon, exon 1, of the NHLRC1 gene (NM_198586), using direct sequencing, was performed. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) method was used to examine the genes and the genomic region that includes the region from exons 1 and 4 of the EPM2A gene and exon 1 of the NHLRC1 gene. The genetic testing identified that the patient is the carrier of the homozygous 1-bp deletion, 990G, within the NHLRC1 gene. Following the result of the genetic testing, clonazepam was included in the patient\\'s therapy. \\nIn July 2015, levetiracetam was added to the therapy. In May 2015, treacheostoma was placed, as well as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Currently, (Apr 2017), the patient is bedridden, in a continuous horizontal position, with the rapid irregular myoclonic twitches noticeable at rest, and increased by voluntary movements of the upper limbs. Furthermore, the patient also experiences frequent episodes of fever, which is insensitive to antipyretics.',\n",

She had a history of two episodes of severe anaphylaxis due to latex exposure. In addition, she suffered from atopic dermatitis and controlled hypothyroidism since her childhood.\\nIn 2001, in a surgical rotation, she was routinely assigned to assist the surgeon in the surgical field for 4 h a day. She regularly wore powdered latex gloves five pairs per day. As a result, she developed on-and-off vesiculopapular rashes, mainly on the dorsal side of both hands. She then applied a topical corticosteroid to control the disease.\\nIn 2004, she worked as a physician and suffered from glove-related contact urticaria. Her skin manifestation was mostly wheal and flare on both hands and arms, with severe pruritic symptoms. She, therefore, decided to put on plastic gloves underneath the powdered latex gloves. However, the symptoms were commonly recurrent. As a result, she frequently used topical steroids to reduce her symptoms. In addition to the latex allergy, she developed allergic symptoms, including urticaria, itching, and flushing after contact with Kiwi, Jackfruit, Durian, Passion fruit, Mango, and Nam Wah Banana. However, she denied any skin prick test to confirm latex-fruit syndrome due to her previous anaphylaxis experience. In addition, as this patient is an internal medicine specialist, she confirmed her allergic reaction was caused by those fruits previously mentioned.\\nIn 2013, she underwent a pelvic examination and suddenly developed flushing, syncope, and facial angioedema. She was diagnosed with anaphylaxis and was administered intramuscular epinephrine, intravenous dexamethasone, and chlorpheniramine. Her symptoms resolved, and she had no complications after 24 h. Following this anaphylaxis episode, she opted for neoprene gloves to replace the latex gloves, albeit her employer did not have any occupational health procedures to support the replacement cost.\\nIn 2019, she underwent a computed tomographic (CT) colonography due to chronic constipation. Unfortunately, she developed a second anaphylaxis episode during the imaging immediately after rubber catheter insertion and prior to contrast media administration. She received emergency management for anaphylaxis and recovered without complications.\\nIn 2020, she was admitted to the clinical fellowship program at KKU. She sought counseling at OH&S for evaluation and specific occupational health management of her latex allergy. According to ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Uppsala):fluorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassay tests:her latex-specific IgE was 10.20 kUA/L with negative results on other atopic allergens. She has been diagnosed with latex allergy with a history of two episodes of latex anaphylaxis.\\nIn addition, OH&S has provided her with personalized occupational health programs, including personal synthetic glove replacements (i.e. nitrile and sterile neoprene gloves), preparation or prevention of possible recurrences (i.e. latex allergy labeling bracelets), and encouraging the use of non-powdered latex gloves among peer healthcare professionals to reduce airborne latex allergens. After these interventions, she has rarely experienced any allergic symptoms in the last 2 years.',\n",

She was previously healthy except for an unclear history of an arrhythmia that occurred in 2005 necessitating the insertion of the cardiac pacemaker. The patient also complained of right breast pain, swelling and erythema of 3 days duration. Her primary care physician had prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanate for suspected mastitis. The patient also reported episodes of fever (temperature reaching 38.5  C) and chills especially at nighttime for about three months prior to this current illness. She denied localizing signs or symptoms at the time.\\nOn physical examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Left chest wall erythema, induration and tenderness were observed. Erosion was noted at the skin overlying the pacemaker impulse generator and wires. The right breast was swollen, diffusely erythematous, and tender. No palpable masses were appreciated. The laboratory examination revealed a normal white Blood Cell count of 5400 per cu mm, (reference range: 4000-11000), polymorphonuclear cells were 50% (reference range: 40-65), and lymphocytes were 40% (reference range: 25-40). Her creatinine was 0.6 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1) but her C-reactive protein was elevated at 12.5 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0-2.5). A computed tomography scan of the chest wall with intravenous contrast revealed three well-circumscribed rim enhancing fluid collections in the right breast the largest measuring 1.9 x 2 cm. There was overlying skin thickening and associated subcentimetric right axillary lymph nodes. A collection on the left side of the chest wall over the site of the pacemaker was also noted.\\nOn the second day of admission, the pacemaker impulse generator and wires were removed. Purulent drainage was noticed in the pacemaker bed and sent for culture. The Gram stain showed numerous WBCs but no microorganisms. The patient received intravenous teicoplanin and amoxicillin-clavulanate empirically awaiting the culture results. An ultrasound-guided aspiration of the right breast abscess was also performed. The content was sent for microbiologic culture as well and cytologic evaluation to rule out an underlying malignancy. On the 5th day of admission, cultures from both the pacemaker bed and the right breast grew Brucella species. The titers for the direct serum tube agglutination (STA) as well as the indirect test (Brucella Capt., Vircell, Spain) were both >= 1:1280. Two sets of blood cultures done on VIRTUO Biomerieux blood culture automated system were negative.\\nUpon further questioning, the patient remembered eating unpasteurized cheese several months before. She also remembered an episode of breast tenderness, swelling and warmth after that. The symptoms resolved spontaneously but were followed by a period of night sweats and low-grade fever.\\nThe patient received intravenous gentamicin (240 mg intramuscularly daily) for two weeks along with rifampin (600 mg orally daily) and doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily) for three months. At the end of her treatment, the patient reported marked improvement in her condition and complete resolution of the fever and chills. Four months later, the patient was asymptomatic, with normal physical examination. Repeat Brucella serology showed a decrease in the direct STA titer (1:320) and indirect Brucella titer (1:640).

A subsequent MRI showed changes consistent with new multifocal embolic infarcts throughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, largest in the left cerebellar hemisphere and right temporal lobe.\\nDue to the presence of new multiple embolic infarcts, a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was then obtained and showed the presence of a small 7-8 mm soft mobile echodensity attached to the atrial surface of the mitral leaflet tips (Supplementary Video S1). Because of the underlying malignancy, NBTE was suspected but a diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis could not be ruled out in the setting of immunosuppression. Blood cultures came back negative, and a workup for antiphospholipid syndrome was negative as well. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done at our institution redemonstrating the soft mobile echodensity at the tip of both leaflets in a \"kissing-lesion\" appearance and measuring up to 1.1 cm in width.

Anti-Xa levels were checked 4 h after the 4th dose and demonstrated therapeutic levels of 1.01. A repeat CT of the head was performed after 2 therapeutic doses (70 mg) of enoxaparin to assess for hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts. She was discharged on therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy, and a TEE repeated after 4 weeks of therapy showed complete resolution of the NBTE (Figure 1, Supplementary Video S3).',\n",

She was also evaluated for BDI-II score (used for follow up), with a result of six [cutoff score used to identify potentially clinically significant depression is 0-13 to indicate minimal or no depression; 14-19, mild depression; 20-28, moderate depression; and 29-63, severe depression ].\\nAfter signing the informed consent forms for participation in the study, she received a WatchPAT device, and began follow up.\\nHer first sleep study showed the following results, indicating normal sleep variables:REM Latency (min): 117, Sleep Latency (min): 15, Proportion of REM sleep 19.1%, Total Sleep Time 6 h 36 min (examples of data obtained from sleep tests in are presented in Figures 1, 2).\\nAs shown in Figures 3, 4, Rem Latency was gradually reduced over the following weeks, followed by a significant reduction to 53 min. At the same time, the BDI-II data obtained showed no significant change in self-report. She later complained of lack of energy and asked to stop using the monitoring watch. After a month of subsequent BDI-II follow-up, significant depressive recurrence was discovered and the study was discontinued. Of notice, in several consecutive follow-ups, the patient refused to change her medications, reporting only subjective feeling of anxiety, relating them to the Covid-19 crisis. She agreed to change her psychopharmacological treatment only a month later, and begun reporting subjective improvement. Interestingly during the Covid-19 crisis, she did not leave her house, therefore ambulatory sessions were done using telemedicine platform.',\n",

Present illness started 5 days ago with fever, cough and wheeze that complicated with and signs of respiratory distress (tachypnea, intercostal retractions) two days later. A chest X-ray was performed showing a giant soft tissue, well-demarcated, well - demarked mass in the right hemithorax expanding and splaying the adjacent ribs, Fig. 1. The mass was an incidental finding in the chest X-ray, as the mass was not visible, nor palpable on examination. Complete Blood Count examination was within normal limits. Signs of respiratory distress gradually resolved after the administration of inhaled bronchodilators and systemic steroids (methylprednisolone). Contrast enhanced CT images revealed a large lobulated, well defined, predominantly fatty mass originating from the chest wall. The lesion was seen to be invading between the ribs with extension into the thorax and into the overlying muscles of the thoracic wall. Inside the fatty mass there where thick enhancing septations with some nodularity. There were no calcifications. Fig. 2.\\nAbdominal ultrasound was performed with normal findings. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a large heterogeneous, lobulated mass in the right posterolateral thoracic wall, measuring 7,1 x 6,3 x 6,8cm. The mass contained mainly high-signal; material identical to that of subcutaneous adipose tissue in all sequences. Inside the mass there were low-signal, non-enhancing streaks probably representing fibrous tissue. There was also a mild enhancing area with high signal on T2 images probably representing myxoid cystic changes. Fig. 3. I n this patient age group the imaging findings were highly suggestive of thoracic wall lipoblastoma. Biopsy of the extrathoracic part of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of also revealed lipoblastoma. A week later, excision of the tumor through a right posterolateral incision at the level of the fifth rib took place. The arch of the 5th rib was removed and the extrapleural part of the mass was excised. The pleura was opened and the intrapleural part of the tumor was exposed extending from the apex of the right lung to the level of the 7th rib and to the midline. The upper and the medial lobe of the lung were compressed towards the midline. Gradual removal of the tumor due to its friability took place. Finally, full excision of the tumor was managed, the lung was decompressed and a thoracic drain was left at the area of the removed mass.\\nPostoperatively, the patient was stable and had an uncomplicated course. He was discharged on the 7th postoperative day with instructions. Three and six months later, on the follow up visit the boy was asymptomatic.',\n",

He has had multiple gastroscopies and colonoscopies in the past as part of the national bowel cancer screening program but however none of these showed any evidence of colitis, malignancy or any other concerning lesions.\\nThe patient did not have aggravated pain, it was similar to what he was experiencing for the last 6 weeks. He had clinical signs of a partial small bowel obstruction at that stage such as not passing bowel motions, only passing flatus and being symptomatic for nausea.\\nHe was afebrile, tachycardic and normotensive on arrival at the hospital. His abdomen was soft and tender centrally but had nil peritonism. He had normal white cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate. The abdominal CT scan (diagnosed by a board certified consultant radiologist) showed dilated jejunal loops with an abrupt transition in the mid-abdomen caused by a short intussusception. The leading edge of the intussuscepted bowel had an irregular outline, which was suspicious for a small mucosal mass of approximately 2.5 cm, acting as a lead point. Distal to the intussusception, the small bowel loops and colon were collapsed (Fig. 1A, B, C and D).\\nHe was resuscitated with intravenous fluids, and a nasogastric tube was inserted given the evidence of dilated small bowel loops on CT and signs of a partial bowel obstruction. About 60 ml of gastric content was aspirated initially. He was given adequate analgesia and antiemetics. The decision was made to perform surgery due to the suspicion of presence of a small bowel mass on CT leading to transient intussusception along with clinical signs of a partial small bowel obstruction.\\nThe case was commenced laparoscopically, however due to nil visualisation of the suspected mass noted on CT, a mini-laparotomy was performed. There were omental adhesions to the RUQ from a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The small bowel loops were not dilated. A small bowel run was performed from Ligament of Treitz (duodenojejunal flexure) to terminal ileum and it was completely normal. There was no significant dilatation, masses or intussusception. There was also no evidence of Meckels diverticulum. Other intraoperative findings included diverticulosis of sigmoid colon.\\nThere were no immediate post-operative complications.

       "    'case_text': \"A 39-year-old man presented to the Neurology Clinic for paralysis of the left arm and half of the left face of a transient nature. A diagnostic of transient ischemic accident and antiphospholipid syndrome was established and treated with acetylsalicylic acid and folic acid. During the physical examination, a thyroid nodule was detected in the right lobe. It showed good mobility on palpation. The ultrasound (US) study revealed a single solid hypoechoic nodule with well-defined limits and peripheral vascularization, in the lower pole of the right lobe, the major axis of which was 1 cm. This nodule was classified as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) 4a. In addition, a slightly hypoechogenic polylobed lesion with no well-defined limits was detected in the middle third of the left lobe, 1.15 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion was also classified as TI-RADS 4a. No cervical enlarged lymph nodes were observed. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) diagnoses were follicular neoplasia in the right lobe and follicular lesion of undetermined significance in the left lobe. The analytical study showed that the lesions in both lobes were non-functional.\\nAfter two years, the neurological symptoms had not recurred and antiphospholipid antibodies had normalized. Three years later, he presented with a sleep disorder that was classified as moderate supine apnea-hypopnea syndrome treated with automatic positive pressure in the airway. A year later, he consulted for a Bennett fracture of the left hand without displacement that was treated with immobilization. A new US study of the thyroid revealed that the lesions had slightly increased in size. The nodule of the right lobe measured 1.5 cm of maximum axis and that of the left lobe 2 cm. The TI-RADS rating scale remained the same for both lobe lesions. The new cytological diagnoses were similar to the previous ones. An otorhinolaryngological study showed no abnormalities. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy six years after the first consultation. Postoperatively, there were no complications. Blood calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were normal. Both thoracoabdominal and abdominopelvic computed tomography scans with contrast showed no significant changes. The patient was doing well three months after the intervention.\\nCytopathological findings\\nFNACs were performed on the patient with US control. The cytological smears were fixed in an ethanol solution or air dried and stained with the Papanicolaou (Pap) and Diff-Quik methods. FNAC of the right lower lobe revealed moderate cellularity. There were groups of clear cells or microfollicular structures with a diffusely vacuolated cytoplasm (Figure 1A). The cell borders were moderately defined. The nuclei were round, hyperchromatic, with homogenous chromatin, and visible single nucleoli. Modest nuclear anisokaryosis was identified. Nuclear pseudoinclusions or grooves were no present. Colloid was very scant. Based on these findings the successive diagnoses in two samples were follicular neoplasia (Figure 1, B and C). FNAC of the left lobe showed moderate cellularity with follicular cells in plates and little colloid. Some cells showed irregular nuclei with grooves. Lymphocytes were seen in the background of the smears. The cytological diagnoses in two samples were follicular lesion of undetermined significance.\\nHistopathological findings\\nThe thyroid weighed 20 g and measured 7x5x3 cm. The right lower lobe contained a 2 cm diameter encapsulated, solid, pale tan, fleshy, nodular lesion (Figure 2). The left lobe showed two brown, non-encapsulated, poorly circumscribed nodules measuring 2 cm and 0.3 cm located in the middle zone.\\nThe entire surgical specimen was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Representative tissue samples were embedded in paraffin. For routine microscopy, 4-mum-thick sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alcian Blue (pH 2.5), Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), PAS-Diastase digestion method, and Mayer's Mucicarmine method. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed using the EnVision FLEX+ Visualization System (Dako, Agilent Technologies, SL, Las Rozas, Madrid, Spain). The IHC reaction was performed using appropriate tissue controls for the antibodies utilized. Automatic staining was accomplished on a Dako Omnis stainer (Agilent Technologies, SL). Antibodies used are detailed in Table 1.\\nThe nodular lesion of the right lobe was well circumscribed, with a thin smooth capsule of fibrous connective tissue (Figure 3A). The cells were grouped in solid areas showing a diffuse, trabecular, or nesting pattern of growth (Figure 3B) with occasional formation of microfollicular structures with central lumen surrounded by clear cells (Figure 4A). The lumens contained PAS-positive colloid (Figure 4B). These cells were large, round to polyhedral, with an abundant clear cytoplasm showing an extremely fine granularity due to fine vesicles. Negative Alcian Blue and Mucicarmine stainings in these cells excluded the presence of mucin. The PAS staining accentuated the cytoplasmic granularity (Figure 4B) and this reaction was diastase resistant indicating the absence of glycogen. The nuclei were central, regular, often with visible nucleoli. The vascularity within the lesion was not prominent. After multiple sections, there was no evidence of multi-nucleated giant balloon cells, spindle cell component, necrosis, mitoses, and extracapsular growth or vascular invasion.\\nThe IHC panel revealed the tumor cells positive for pan-cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3 (Figure 5A), thyroglobulin (TGB) (Figure 5B), paired box gene 8 protein (PAX8) (Figure 5C), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Figure 5D), whereas no immunoreactivity was seen for renal cell carcinoma marker (RCCM), cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), PTH, p53 protein, anti-human melanosome [human melanoma black 45 (HMB45)], S100 protein, and smooth muscle actin (SMA). The Ki67 index was around 1%. A diagnosis of complete clear cell change in follicular adenoma of the thyroid was made. Besides, intrathyroidal ectopic parathyroid without histological abnormalities was also found in the right lower lobe. The nodules of the left lobe corresponded to conventional hyperplasic nodules.\",\n",

Before admission to our hospital, he was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis at other hospitals and had received antibiotic treatment numerous times. Despite antibiotic treatment, his symptoms progressively worsened such that he required oxygen therapy and ECOG performance status of him was 4. A physical examination revealed that his respiratory rate was 25 cycles per minute. Moreover, diffuse wheezing could be heard in both the lung fields. Laboratory findings included leukocytosis (11.52 x 109/L) and significantly reduced partial pressure of oxygen (63 mmHg). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed an oxygen uptake of 3 L/min. We also have conducted related inspections to rule out systemic involvement. Results of tests for liver and kidney function, myocardial enzyme levels, NT-proBNP, and troponin levels were unremarkable, and no proteinuria was found on 24-h urine analysis. Color Doppler echocardiography showed normal cardiac structure. No abnormalities were found in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The results of the PPD test were negative, as were all sputum samples for bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi. The patient's lung function test revealed obstructive dysfunction of pulmonary ventilation with a severe reduction in small airway function, and his bronchodilator test result was negative.\\nChest computed tomography (CT) revealed that the tracheal walls and bronchi were extensively uneven to different degrees and exhibited luminal stenosis (Figures 1A,B). Electronic bronchoscopy revealed completely irregular and thickened bronchial mucosal surface with prominent nodes accompanied by a small amount of white secretion (Figure 1C). The lumen of the right middle bronchus exhibited extreme narrowing, and pathological examination of the tracheal mucosal biopsy specimen at the site of narrowing revealed mucosal calcification and fibrous hyperplasia with deposition of kappa light chain, as well as the following: PAS stain (-), acid-fast staining (-), and Congo red stain (+) (Figure 1F).\\nSerum electrophoresis showed a monoclonal spike, although immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) revealed a double monoclonal component: IgA kappa and IgG kappa (Figures 1D,E). Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgG levels were 1.48 g/L (0.7-4.0 g/L), 0.62 g/L (0.4-2.3 g/L), and 5.23 g/L (7.0-16.0 g/L), respectively. The free kappa and lambda light chain levels were 15.8 mg/L (normal, 6.7-22.4 mg/L) and 17.8 mg/L (normal, 8.3-27.0 mg/L), respectively, with a normal kappa/lambda ratio of 0.888 (normal, 0.31-1.56). Bone marrow cytology revealed an irregular monoclonal plasma cell population (CD45+, CD38+, CD138+, CD200+, and ckappa+), representing 0.86% of the total leukocytes.\\nThe patient underwent further examinations to determine the extent of systemic involvement. Echocardiography revealed no signs of myocardial involvement. Skeletal osteolytic lesions, organomegaly, and neuropathy were absent. Blood biochemistry revealed normal levels of creatinine, liver enzymes, and alkaline phosphatase. Based on the comprehensive evaluation described thus far, the patient was diagnosed with localized amyloidosis given the observed lack of extrapulmonary organ involvement.\\nThe broad endobronchial manifestations enabled the performance of endoscopic resection of the amyloid masses under combined rigid and soft bronchoscopy guidance. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) and Nd:YAG laser debridement for the treatment of his endobronchial obstruction. However, this did not improve the patient's dyspnea with massive expectoration. Therefore, we attempted to relieve his persistent endobronchial obstruction by initiating external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) at a dose of 20 Gy in 10 fractions of 2 Gy each. However, the patient's dyspnea showed no significant improvement at 3 months after the EBRT. Another bronchoscopy revealed progression of the tracheobronchial lesions due to the endobronchial situation. Subsequently, he experienced an aggravation of dyspnea, developed an inability to move, and reported poor quality of life.\\nThe patient then consulted with our hematology department. Although he had not previously received systemic treatment for local amyloidosis, we noticed that local treatment could not alleviate his symptoms or delay the disease progression. Therefore, given his strong desire for treatment, we administered systematic chemotherapy. He was treated with one cycle of CyBorD [subcutaneous (SC) bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide: 300 mg/m2 on days 1-4; IV dexamethasone: 20 mg on days 1-4 and 8-11]. Interestingly, the patient's symptoms of dyspnea improved significantly after treatment. In addition to a decrease in sputum volume, he began to perform simple daily activities, and evidence suggested functional improvements in oxygenation and spirometry findings (Table 1). However, follow-up bronchoscopy and chest CT performed 1 month later revealed no improvements in the obstruction. After one cycle of treatment, there was minimal secretion, the patient did not require inhaled oxygen, and he could walk independently. The patient has completed three cycles of treatment, and the ECOG performance status is 0. The patient exhibits good tolerance to CyBorD regimen, and no treatment-related adverse reactions such as peripheral neuritis, infectious disease and bone marrow suppression have occurred. The patient's ECOG score is reduced from 4 to 0 which shows an improvement of life quality, and the pulmonary function test results show that obstructive ventilatory disorder is improved. The patient is evaluated a validated organ response.\",\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed right middle artery cerebral stroke as well as 85% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery (ICA). An uptrending troponin-I to 3.510 ng/mL prompted the diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and immediate cardiac catheterization followed. Cardiac catheterization revealed 70% left main coronary artery stenosis and complete occlusion of the distal right coronary artery. Two days after catheterization, the patient went for right ICA endarterectomy and two-vessel CABG with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal along with mitral valve repair with a 28-mm annuloplasty Physio II Ring (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California, United States). The patient was supported with inotropes, vasopressors, and intra-aortic balloon pump postoperatively.\\n On postoperative day 6, a chest computed tomography scan performed due to respiratory distress revealed a potential LVPA. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified an outpouching of the basal inferolateral left ventricular wall as well as a supra-annular and posterolaterally dehisced mitral annuloplasty ring. The patient was subsequently transferred to our institution, where noncontrast cardiac MRI confirmed the finding and identified a significant amount of layered thrombus. A repeat TEE at our institution further characterized the dehisced mitral ring as well as the LVPA contained by the posterolateral pericardium ( Fig. 1 ). The patient subsequently underwent redo sternotomy for repair of the LVPA repair along with MVR ( Fig. 2 ). \\n During surgery, the right ventricle was found to be densely adhered to the sternum likely from severe pericarditis due to residual intrapericardial blood. The LIMA was identified and prepared for temporary occlusion during the cardioplegic arrest. After standard bicaval cardiopulmonary bypass was established and cardioplegic arrest, the left atrium was opened, and the mitral valve was inspected. The dehisced annuloplasty ring was removed, and the whole posterior leaflet was detached from the annulus. The LVPA neck measuring 8 x 6 cm was identified under the P3 area of the annulus and extending toward the lateral commissure. The anterior leaflet was detached from the annulus, and while preserving all chords, the A2 segment was divided in the middle separating it into medial and lateral portions in preparation for total chordal-sparing MVR. Given that the pseudoaneurysm defect was much larger than the orifice of the mitral valve, it was apparent that bovine patch repair via intracardiac approach would not be feasible even if all mitral leaflets were detached. We therefore decided it was necessary to patch the pseudoaneurysm via an external approach. The 12 x 10 x 9 cm pseudoaneurysm was first exposed and incised. Subsequently, a large amount of thrombus was removed with great care to avoid any fragmentation. The pseudoaneurysm wall was then carefully cleaned of all thrombi with high power suction with an open-ended tip ( Fig. 3A ). The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was patched on the posterior aspect of the heart using a bovine pericardium patch and sewn to the underside of the mitral annulus extending to the anterior and medial aspects of the ventricle ( Fig. 3C ). The remaining flaps of the pseudoaneurysm were excised and closed by suture. \\n In repairing the mitral annulus, chordae tendineae were spared to support the posterior annulus with parts of the anterior and posterior leaflets and to maintain left ventricular structure. Pledgeted sutures in a noneverting manner were placed from the ventricular side to the atrial side at the level of the A3-P3 commissure ( Fig. 3D ). Sutures were placed through the patch and the annulus was sized to accommodate a new 29-mm pericardial Magna Valve (Edwards Lifesciences). The sutures were secured, and the atrium was closed. The cross-clamp time was 180 minutes, and total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 267 minutes. Final postoperative TEEs confirmed successful closure of the LVPA, normally functioning mitral valve prosthesis, and an ejection fraction of 50%.',\n",

On physical examination, there was a tender bony prominence over the lateral epicondyle. Bilateral elbow radiographs demonstrated hyperostosis, especially involving the proximal ulnas, bilateral triceps tendon insertions, and the right lateral humeral condyle (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). No fracture, dislocation, joint effusion, or radiographic evidence of triceps tendon tear was evident in the right elbow (Fig. 3).\\nAlthough no prior elbow radiographs were available for comparison, radiographs of the thoracic spine from two years prior also showed flowing ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament with relatively maintained disc spaces (Fig. 4).

Three weeks after surgery the patient had a CT head that revealed a peripherally enhancing fluid collection measuring 3.1 cm x 5.9 cm along the right frontal scalp in close proximity to the frontal sinuses and enhancement of the frontal subdural space. MRI head confirmed the findings (Fig. 1). The patient underwent surgical debridement of the abscess with frontal sinus trephination. Cultures were obtained, which grew Actinomyces naeslundi. Due to history of being allergic to penicillin the patient was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone for 9 weeks and then transitioned to oral doxycycline for a total of 6 months of therapy. At 6 month follow up, her symptoms and radiological abnormalities had resolved.',\n",

Cutaneous candidiasis is divided into two types namely intertriginous and granulomatous candidiasis. In intertriginous candidiasis, lesions occur on the skin folds of the armpits, groin, intergluteal, breast fold, between fingers or toes, glans penis, and umbilicus in the form of streaks that are demarcated, scaly, wet and erythematous. Lesions are surrounded by dots in the form of small vesicles and pustules or bullae that leave erosive areas. On the other hand, granulomatous candidiasis is more common in children and presents as reddish papules covered in thick brownish yellow crusts and are firmly attached to the base. This lesion may appear like a 2cm long horn and can often be found on the face, head, nails, body, and legs. We report a case of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida kefyr in a 72-year-old woman who responded well to topical antifungal therapy.',\n",

History of similar complaint from the family was denied. History of diabetes mellitus was absent. Patient had a history of syphilis with HIV infection and got therapy of intramuscular injection 2.4 million unit of benzathine penicillin G for three consecutive weeks. He was also treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir 300mg, lamivudine 300mg, and efavirenz 600mg.\\nPhysical examination showed blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 beats per minute, and temperature 36.5 C. Laboratory blood tests were within normal limits. Neurologic examination showed decreased awareness and lateralization of both sides. Dermatological examination of the posterior trunk region found hyperpigmented macules accompanied by crust, squama and erythematous macules (Figure 1). Based on the history taking and physical examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, suspected meningoencephalitis, hypoalbuminemia, community-acquired pneumonia, and cutaneous candidiasis. The patient was given citicoline 500mg/12 hours/IV, omeprazole 40mg/12 hours/IV, ceftriaxone 2gr/12 hours/IV, vancomycin 1gr/12 hours/IV, vitamin B complex 1gr/24 hours/intravenously, acetazolamide 250mg/12 hours/nasogastric tube, and paracetamol 1gr/8 hours/intravenously. Topical fusidic acid cream was also applied on ulcerative lesions to avoid bacterial superinfection. For the cutaneous candidiasis, patient was treated with miconazole cream twice daily in the morning and evening and fusidic acid cream for 14 days. Direct microscopic examination using 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and culture were done to for further investigation on the causative agent. Direct microscopic of the skin scrapings on the back using 10% KOH showed clustered spores and pseudohyphae (Figure 2). Culture in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) media added with chloramphenicol incubated at 25 -30 C showed mucoid brownish white colonies with smooth surfaces on the third day (Figure 3), typical of the fungus Candida sp. One week later, gram staining was carried out and positive purple color mildews were obtained (Figure 4). There were yeast cells and budding spores which were consistent with candida species. Further examination was carried out using carbohydrate fermentation to determine the type of candida which showed a change in color from purple to orange in glucose, sucrose, and lactose and gas formed in each of the reagents (Figure 5). The findings from carbohydrate fermentation test supported Candida kefyr as the causative agent (Table 1).\\nData from the history taking, physical examination, and supporting examinations concluded a diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida kefyr. On the fifth day of treatment the lesion showed marked improvement (Figure 6). Fusidic acid was dropped and only miconazole was continued.

He endorsed occasional smoking, but denied any hazardous or environmental exposures through his work in construction. An initial evaluation with a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 19cm diffusely heterogeneous right renal mass. Further evaluation with an abdominal MRI confirmed the presence of a right renal mass, measuring 20.3 x 12.6 x 10.6cm, with both solid and cystic components (Figure 1). A chest CT identified multiple sub-centimeter lung nodules. Initial laboratory testing was unremarkable with the exception of a mild leukocytosis and 2+ blood on urine dipstick.\\nGiven this presentation and high suspicion for renal carcinoma, the patient was referred to a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center for further evaluation and management of his large right renal mass.

She was otherwise healthy, not taking any medication. Her family history was unremarkable. The patient was referred to the hematology department with the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. She had been observed in her local hospital two months earlier, after the incidental discovery of leukocytosis with eosinophilia, bicytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Table 1). At the time, a bone marrow aspirate was performed and revealed a hypercellular bone marrow (BM) with marked hypereosinophilia, no increase in the number of blasts, and no specific morphologic alterations. Immunophenotyping and cytogenetic studies were not conducted at this point. The patient was kept under observation and remained asymptomatic, with spontaneous normalization of the hematological parameters and LDH. Two months later a cervical enlarged lymph node appeared. The excisional biopsy showed lymphoblastic lymphoma of T-cell lineage, and she was referred to our hospital for further management.\\nAt admission, the patient presented with fatigue but was otherwise asymptomatic. Specifically, she denied respiratory, gastrointestinal, or other symptoms suggestive of a reactive eosinophilia. She was not a smoker and had no history of allergies. Physical examination revealed enlarged bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen.\\nLaboratory abnormalities included anemia, a slight leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and a normal LDH (Table 1). \\nThe cervical lymph node biopsy was reviewed, and the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was confirmed. A fine needle aspirate was conducted and flow cytometry studies showed infiltration by 92% aberrant immature T-cells that were Tdt/CD99/cCD3/CD5/CD2/CD1a/CD4 positive. The fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for BCR-ABL gene fusion in the lymph node aspirate was negative.\\nThe BM aspirate revealed a normocellular BM with 45.8% eosinophils, relative granulocytic hyperplasia, and no lymphoblastic or myeloblastic infiltration. No dysplastic changes were found. Flow cytometric analysis did not identify an aberrant lymphoid or myeloid population; 0.3% CD34+ precursors were present. BM biopsy findings were interpreted as reactive. \\nThe investigation of PDGFRA rearrangements by FISH and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the bone marrow was negative at this time point. Cytogenetic studies showed a normal karyotype in the 20 metaphases analyzed. \\nAs part of the lymphoma staging procedures, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed showing multiple enlarged lymph nodes (cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, iliopelvic, and inguinal) as well as splenomegaly. The PET scan revealed some adenopathies with an increased metabolism. Neoplastic cells were not found in the spinal tap.\\nTreatment was started according to the CALGB 9111 protocol for lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, with complete remission documented after induction. The patient proceeded with the early intensifications, according to schedule, without significant toxicities, except for an allergic reaction to the E.Coli asparaginase requiring a switch to Erwinase. Central nervous system prophylaxis was performed with high dose methotrexate (MTX), and radiotherapy was not administered due to the known history of multiple sclerosis.\\nSixteen days after MTX administration, the patient was admitted with fever without an obvious infectious cause. A progressive increase in the leukocytosis, with neutrophilia, eosinophilia (Table 1), monocytosis, and the appearance of immature myeloid precursors in the peripheral blood (myeloblasts 8%, promyelocytes 3%, myelocytes 3%, and metamyelocytes 4%) followed, as well as a raise in LDH levels. This picture resembled the alterations that occurred two months prior to diagnosis.\\nAt this time, a repeated BM aspirate showed a hypercellular marrow, with myeloid hyperplasia, and infiltration by 11% of myeloblasts (Figure 1). This finding was confirmed by flow cytometry that identified 10% myeloblasts expressing CD34, CD117, HLA-DR, CD33, and CD13. Prominent eosinophilia was also present, and phenotypic aberrations in the granulocytic maturation were evident. There was no evidence of lymphoblastic infiltration either in morphology or in flow cytometry. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed 10 metaphases with t(7;12)(q22;p13) as well as the addition of unknown genetic material to the short arm of chromosome 16 (Figure 2(a)). FISH studies using a dual color break-apart probe were positive for the ETV6 (12p13) rearrangement (Figure 2(b)). To further characterize these alterations, whole chromosome painting of chromosomes 7 and 12 was conducted (Figure 2(c)) and revealed a complex pattern of rearrangements involving chromosomes 7, 12, and 16: 46,XX,del(7)(q22),der(12)t(7;12)(q22;p13)t(12;16)(p13;p13),der(16)t(12;16).\\nThe BM samples were also retested for PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and BCR-ABL rearrangements by FISH, with repeated negative results.\\nA PET scan was repeated at this time point and showed only splenic caption (SUV 4.55). An abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous splenomegaly without nodular lesions, suggesting a spleen infiltrative process.\\nDespite the introduction of high dose of steroid therapy, there was a progressive increase of leukocytosis with 19% circulating myeloblasts, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, possibly reflecting progression to acute myeloid leukemia, although this finding was not confirmed by bone marrow evaluation. Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea was attempted with a slow but steady decrease in the leukocyte counts.\\nEight days later, the patient developed sudden dyspnea with severe respiratory failure. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates present on chest X-ray and high resolution pulmonary CT scan raised the hypothesis of an infectious process. In spite of antimicrobial therapy, the patient progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and eventually died in the ICU, about 4 weeks after the febrile episode and 6 months after the diagnosis of lymphoblastic lymphoma. Autopsy was not conducted, so the exact cause of death (infection/disease progression) was not determined.',\n",

He had an eccentric 7.5 mm penetrating keratoplasty, which made repeat full thickness keratoplasty with a larger donor graft a high risk for rejection. He also had a mild cataract. Therefore, he was offered Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) on failed PK combined with cataract surgery using standard keratometry of 43.5D and a hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens. After inserting the intraocular lens, while the anterior chamber was filled with a cohesive viscoelastic device, we performed a Descematorhexis within the graft-host junction. Care was taken not to expose posterior stromal strands during Descematorhexis. After a thorough washout of the viscoelastic device a 7.25 mm Descemet membrane graft was delivered and secured on the stroma within the old penetrating keratoplasty, using an intracameral injection of 50% Sodium Hexafluoride (SF6) gas. Cyclopentolate 1% eye drops were used immediately after the injection of gas to prevent pupillary block, since he has had no peripheral iridotomies. The patient was advised to comply with supine posture for a minimum of 2 days and was given antibiotic-steroid combination drops qds for a month, G. Cyclopentolate 1% tds for a week and Tb. Acetazolamide 250 mg sustained release for 3 days post-surgery. One week post-operatively the cornea appeared oedematous with inferior detachment of DMEK graft (Figure 1(a)). Re-bubbling with air was performed at the slit lamp via 5 o'clock paracentesis,   the patient was started on Acetazolamide 250 mg slow release tablets for 3 days and advised to maintain a supine posture for a minimum of 2 days and ideally as long as the air was present in the anterior chamber. One week later, he was noticed to have persistent inferior graft detachment and corresponding corneal oedema (Figure 1(a)); therefore, the second re-bubbling was performed at the slit lamp in the same fashion. His cornea remained oedematous inferiorly at 4 weeks due to persistent inferior Descemet membrane detachment (Figure 1(a)) despite two subsequent re-bubblings. Careful inspection of his anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) revealed a ridge on the posterior surface of the graft-host junction infero-nasally (Figure 1(a)), which was the probable cause of his recurrent inferior Descemet membrane detachment. To manage this complication, he underwent DMEK suturing in the theatre under subtenon anaesthesia. The detached graft was repositioned, using intracameral injection of air. Based on the extent of the DMEK detachment three radial full thickness 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures were placed in the inferior cornea to hold the graft in place. The needle passed through the host cornea and exited from the graft cornea. Care was taken not to tear the detached Descemet with unnecessary needle movement in the anterior chamber (Supplemental Video 1) (Figure 1(b)). One week post-operatively, his AS-OCT confirmed complete attachment of the DMEK graft with clear appearance of posterior protuberance (Figure 1(c)). Four weeks later, the corneal sutures were removed at the slit lamp and no further sutures were needed. Following this, his medications switched to G. Dexamethasone 0.1% qds for 2 months followed by bd for long-term. His corneal oedema resolved (Figure 2(a) and (b)) and his visual acuity gradually improved. Eight months from DMEK, his cornea was clear, and his unaided visual acuity was 20/63 with BCVA of 20/32 using rigid gas permeable contact lens (best spectacle corrected vision was 20/60 and best contact lens corrected vision was 20/32 before PK graft failure).\\nThe patient provided written informed consent to publish all related medical data, images and videos.\",\n",

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the LE demonstrated subretinal fluid overlying the macular lesion (Figure 3 (Fig. 3)). No abnormalities were detected in the RE. Screening blood tests, including syphilis serology, were requested and the patient was monitored without treatment.\\nThree days after the placoid lesion had extended (Figure 1B (Fig. 1)). The patient did not follow our recommendation for serologic work-up and the tests were ordered again. One week after the initial presentation, VA remained stable but the placoid lesion had increased outside the temporal retinal vascular arcades (Figure 1C (Fig. 1)). New multiple yellow lesions and hemorrhages were observed in the retinal superior nasal area. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) revealed persistent leakage of the choriocapillaris and hypofluorescence areas in the early and late phases (Figure 4 (Fig. 4)). The patient continued not to follow our recommendation for the blood tests and they were ordered for the third time. He was informed again about his clinical situation and the importance of the work-up was underlined. \\nThe patient abandoned the clinic for two weeks and when observed again, VA had improved to 20/20 in the LE and the lesions showed complete spontaneous resolution (Figure 1D (Fig. 1)). RE examination remained normal. Finally, we had access to the serologic tests results that revealed a positive VDRL (1/128) and FTA-ABS. HIV titers were negative. All other tests were normal. The diagnosis of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis in the LE was made. The patient was referred to the Infectious Disease Department. He had no other syphilitic manifestations and no abnormalities were detected after computed tomography of the cranium and orbits. A lumbar puncture revealed a positive VDRL and CSF-TPHA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient accepted to start treatment only 45 days after the initial presentation. During this period no relapse of the ocular lesions occurred and no systemic manifestation was observed. The patient was treated with intravenous aqueous penicillin G (four million units given every 4 h for 2 weeks). Three months after treatment, VA was 20/20 and fundoscopy remained normal both eyes. Follow-up serologic testing revealed a decrease of VDRL to 1/32.',\n",

She had a history of diabetes mellitus for 20 years for which she is taking insulin. Her most recent HbA1C was 7.5%. She had no history of hypertension or renal problems. She had no past ocular history. Examination revealed a corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/40 in her right eye and 20/100 in the left. Anterior segment examination showed nuclear sclerosis in both eyes. Posterior segment examination revealed intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants indicating severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes with clinically significant macular edema in the left eye confirmed by fluorescein angiography (Figure 1). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula was done and revealed multiple cystic spaces, mild subfoveal neurosensory detachment, and diffuse retinal thickening with a central subfield macular thickness of 332 mum in the left eye (Figure 2(a)). The right eye showed only few cystic spaces with minimal thickening. OCTA (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) was done in both eyes and showed areas of capillary nonperfusion in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) of the maculae of both eyes (Figures 3(a) and 3(e)). Three monthly intravitreal bevacizumab injections were done to treat the macular edema in the left eye. One month following the last intravitreal injection, CDVA improved to 20/60 in the left eye and was stable in the right eye. OCT showed improvement of the macular edema in the left eye (Figure 2(b)). OCTA was performed in both eyes and showed decreased vascular density of the SCP of the left eye compared to pretreatment OCTA while a mild increase was noted in the vascular density of the SCP of the untreated right eye (Figures 3(b) and 3(f)). The patient was then followed up without requiring further intravitreal injections and 4 months following the last intravitreal injection OCTA was repeated in both eyes and showed improvement of the vascular density of the SCP of the left eye with unchanged SCP in the right eye (Figures 3(c) and 3(g)). CDVA was 20/60 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left. Clinical examination revealed retinal neovascularization in the right eye with clinically significant macular edema in both eyes. OCT showed increased center-involving macular edema in both eyes with recurrent neurosensory detachment in the left eye (Figure 2(c)). Three monthly intravitreal bevacizumab injections were then done for treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the right eye and the macular edema in both eyes. One month following the last intravitreal injection, CDVA was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left, OCT showed decreased macular thickness in both eyes (Figure 2(d)), and OCTA revealed decreased vascular density of the SCP of both eyes (Figures 3(d) and 3(h)).

       "    'case_text': \"A 60-year-old woman had been aware of a mass in her left lower neck for 5 months. She underwent an open biopsy of the left neck by a previous physician. The findings of the histopathological examination indicated spindle cell sarcoma. On physical examination, an extremely soft mass was palpated in the left lower neck. Computed tomography (CT) scans (Figure 1(a)) revealed a 60 x 26 x 42 mm well-marginated soft tissue mass in the left lower anterior neck. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was markedly displaced anteriorly. The mass presented with heterogeneous enhancement and low-density areas, suggesting the presence of intralesional fat. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the tumor exhibited soft tissue intensity with scattered high intensity that was suggestive of fat in T1-weighted images (WI) (Figure 1(b)) and T2WI (Figure 1(c)). In fat-suppressed gadolinium-enhanced T1WI (Figure 1(d)), the mass showed marked enhancement, and high-intensity areas were suppressed. On 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) imaging, the maximum standard uptake volume in the tumor was 2.1. Histopathological examination of the previous open biopsy revealed spindle cells with epithelioid differentiation. On immunohistochemical examination, the spindle cells and epithelial cells were cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3 (+). The spindle cells were alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) (+), S100 (-), desmin (-), Bcl2 (+), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (-). SS and spindle cell carcinoma were suspected.\\nThe tumor was resected from the left neck under general anesthesia. The scar created by the previous open biopsy was also resected. The sternocleidomastoid muscle around the tumor was also resected. Resection progressed along the deep cervical fascia with attaching adipose tissue surrounding the tumor. A phrenic nerve running to the deep portions of the tumor was resected. The tumor was detached from the surrounding tissue. Intraoperative frozen section examination results indicated the presence of a spindle cell tumor.\\nWe used frozen samples to assess SYT-SSX fusion gene expression by PCR. cDNA was prepared from total RNA extracted from the excised specimen. We used the SYT51 (5'-cagggaccacctccacaacag-3') and SSX124-31 (5'-cctctgctggcttcttgggc-3') primers, which recognize SSX1/2/4, to perform the 35-cycle PCR. The SYT-SSX fusion gene was not expressed, and thus SS was eliminated from the differential diagnosis. On histopathological examination of the resected tumor, the tumor consisted of plump to thin spindle cells growing in a bundle shape (Figure 2(a)), epithelial cells that formed anastomosing cords (Figure 2(b)), and epithelial islands with solid or microcystic extension areas. In addition, mature adipose cells (Figure 2(c)) and lymphocytes were observed between spindle cells and epithelial cells. Upon evaluation of the overall lesion, we diagnosed the tumor as EHT. The patient has had no recurrence for 56 months after surgery. The patient provided written informed consent for all medical procedures and for the publication of this case report.\",\n",

The histopathological examination suggested SS. The previous physician planned to perform surgery after chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The patient was referred to our department to obtain more detailed examinations before surgery. On physical examination, a soft mass was palpated in the lower left neck. CT scans (Figure 3(a)) revealed a 42 x 35 x 48 mm well-circumscribed mass with nonhomogeneous enhancement between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal jugular vein. The mass had low signal intensity similar to muscle on T1WI (Figure 3(b)) and higher intensity than muscle on T2WI (Figure 3(c)). Densities and intensities resembling those of intralesional and marginal fat were observed. On FDG-PET/CT, there was no accumulation in the tumor. Upon histopathological examination of the open biopsy performed by the previous physician, the tumor consisted of comparatively even spindle cells and adipose-like cells. According to the immunohistochemical examination, the spindle cells were CK AE1/3 (+), alpha-SMA (+), S100 (-), desmin (-), Bcl2 (+), and TdT (-). The tumor was suspected of being SS. We used the Vysis SS18 Break-Apart FISH Probe Kit (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). The gene was not disrupted in the sample, and SS was excluded from the differential diagnosis.\\nOn the basis of the findings in Case 1, we suspected EHT, but a definitive diagnosis could not be obtained from the biopsy. Tumor resection from the left neck was performed under general anesthesia. The scar created by the previous open biopsy was also resected. Part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between the skin scar and the tumor was also resected. The tumor (Figure 3(d)) was encapsulated with a smooth surface, and there was no adhesion to the surroundings. The surrounding organs were preserved, aside from the partial resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle between the tumor and the scar, which was performed because the possibility of malignancy could not be excluded.\\nOn intraoperative frozen section examination, spindle cells with no pleomorphism and adipose tissue were seen inside the lesion. Necrosis and mitotic figures were absent. These findings were compatible with a diagnosis of EHT. On histopathological examination of the resected tumor, the tumor consisted of plump to thin spindle cells growing in a bundle shape (Figure 4(a)) and adipose cells (Figure 4(b)). Based on immunohistochemical examination and fusion gene examination, we diagnosed the tumor as EHT. The patient has had no recurrence for 29 months after surgery.

He suddenly felt weakness in the right lower limb during farming over 4 months ago, accompanied by pain and cramps in the calf. He received treatment in the community for 4 days, and the above symptoms disappeared. One week after the initial onset of the weakness, the patient began to have left-sided angle of mouth, salivation, chewing difficulties, difficulty in closing the right eye, slurred speech, transient diplopia, ataxia, weakened tendon reflex of the right limb, and the MRC grade of the right limb muscle was 4 (Table 1), with CT examination showing low-density lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia area. The patient's symptoms progressed after antithrombotic treatment, with recurrence of transient diplopia. He was discharged after 2 weeks of hospitalization. At 9 weeks after the initial onset, after suffering from upper respiratory tract infection, pain occurred in the lower parts of both lower limbs, and the distal knuckles and toes of both lower limbs continued to have numbness. The distal numbness of the limbs gradually spread to the proximal end, accompanied by weakness of both feet, followed by weakness of the limbs, mainly the distal limbs. At 13 weeks after initial onset, he had difficulty in passing stool and needed enema to help, and 15 weeks after initial onset, he had difficulty in passing urine. He was in good health in the past and had a history of COVID-19 vaccination 10 days before the onset of symptoms. He did not have a family history of genetic disease or history of exposure to poisons.\\nUpon admission, the following were observed: normal cognitive function, the speech was unclear, bilateral forehead lines disappeared, could not wrinkle forehead, bilateral eye closure was weak and right side was obvious, the right nasolabial groove was shallow, the bilateral drum gills were weak, the strength of the right side teeth was weak, the angle of mouth was left, the tongue body was thin, the tongue muscle strength was weak, with right tongue muscle tremor. The masticatory muscle was slightly weak, the pharyngeal reflex disappeared, shoulder shrug and neck were powerful, the neck flexion was weak. Limb muscle strength (MRC) grades: proximal left upper limb: V, distal: II+; left lower limb proximal extensor: IV+, flexor: III, distal: II; proximal right upper limb: V, distal: II+; proximal extensor of right lower limb: IV-, flexor: II+, distal: 0. The muscle tension of both lower limbs decreased, the tendon reflex and abdominal wall reflex of the limbs disappeared. The ataxia of both upper limbs was unstable and both lower limbs cannot be completed. Stocking glove hypoesthesia was observed for vibratory and cold stimuli.\\nUpon auxiliary examination, the following were observed: blood test examination: blood routine, blood coagulation routine; blood glucose, liver and kidney function, thyroid function, tumor markers, serum protein electrophoresis, and vitamin B12 were not significantly abnormal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level: 618.91 mg/dL (normal value 15-45 mg/dL), white blood cell count: 6/muL (normal value 0-8/muL). The neuroelectrophysiology is shown in Table 2. An MRI of the cervical plexus is shown in Figure 1A, an MRI of the lumbosacral plexus in Figure 1B, and musculoskeletal ultrasounds are shown in Figure 2.\\nThe diagnosis upon admission was as follows: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP)?/ACIDP?/Autoimmune nodopathies? After IVIG treatment, the limb weakness of the patients improved. Blood antibody report: anti-CNTN1 antibody IgG4 positive 1:100, CSF corresponding antibody 1:32. Diagnosis: Autoimmune nodopathies. The treatment was 500 mg methylprednisolone intravenous shock therapy and hormone reduction 5 days after surgery with 48 mg methylprednisolone orally administered.

       "    'case_text': 'A 68-year-old Chinese man complained of gradual visual loss that occurred in both eyes over a period longer than 9 months. Approximately 6 months before he came to our clinic, he underwent a subtotal pneumonectomy to treat a pulmonary tumor, for which the pathological diagnosis was benign. Two months before he came to our clinic, assessments at another medical center revealed increased intraocular pressure (IOP) (around 30 mmHg in both eyes), a whole circle thickened ciliary body according to ultrasonic biomicroscopy (UBM), and decreased anterior chamber depth. He was able to count fingers in an assessment of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for both eyes. The IOP was 19 mmHg for the right eye and 20 mmHg for the left eye. A slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment of the eyes showed obviously tortuous and dilated episcleral vessels (Supplementary Figure 1), significantly decreased depth of anterior chamber, iris bombe, slight eversion of iris pigment at the pupillary margin and prominent cortical opacity of the lens (Figure 1). There were no signs of synechia, neovascular membranes in the iris, or active inflammation (Figure 1). Open angles with pigmentation within the trabecular meshwork were revealed by gonioscopy. Color fundus retinal photography revealed typical exudative retinal detachment in both eyes (Figure 1), accompanied by naevus-like multifocal reddish patches under RPE in the superior part of the fundus. Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) showed exudative retinal detachment of the macula with multiple hyperreflective elevated lesions under RPE. Lensectomy, peripheral iridectomy, diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), and silicon oil tamponade were performed on the right eye to deepen the anterior chamber, restore the transparency of the refractive media, reattach the retina, and take a choroid sample for biopsy. Vitreous fluid and subretinal fluid were collected during the surgery, but immunological analyses revealed no specific positive results. Haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for biopsies from the choroid suggested predominantly spindle-shaped melanocytic cell masses, while immunohistochemistry showed that the samples were positive for antibodies against S-100, and negative for antibodies against Ki67, LCA, PAX-5, and SOX-10 (Figure 2). The histopathological examination showed that the choroid lesion was a benign proliferation of melanocytes.\\nOne month after surgery in the right eye, the patient underwent surgery in the left eye. This had a similar procedure but no biopsy, and subretinal fluid was drained through the sclera. At a 1-week follow-up assessment, the BCVA of the patient had recovered to 20/100 for the right eye and 20/80 for the left eye, and the IOP was 21 mmHg for both eyes. The depth of the anterior chamber had increased and the iris bombe had disappeared (Figure 3). The retina was basically reattached with only a small amount of subretinal fluid. A mass of multifocal reddish patches (Figure 3) was found all around the retina, especially in the mid-peripheral sections. These patches were consistent with the elevated hyper-reflective mass under RPE (Figure 3) in the OCT data, and also with the hyperfluorescence in the autofluorescence images and hypofluorescence in the early FA data.\\nA small amount of subretinal fluid persisted during the early postoperative follow-up period, and this was accompanied by thickening of the choroid. Three months after the operation, the patient underwent a rectectomy to treat a rectal tumor, and postoperative pathology revealed a rectal adenocarcinoma. Six months after the rectectomy, the subretinal fluid had completely disappeared and the thickness of the ciliary body and choroid had significantly decreased (Figure 4). The BCVA had improved to 20/60 for both eyes at the last follow-up.',\n",

The family history was unremarkable, and the other four siblings were healthy, with a history of one abortion. She had early motor development delay (sat at 2 years and walked at 3 years), speech delay, and subnormal mentality. Skeletal changes with a waddling gait, difficulty rising after sitting down. During the clinical examination, she had good eye contact, obeyed simple commands, and could pronounce a few unclear words. She could walk with assistance. Stairs are difficult. She looks like a dysmorphic triangular face with a prominent check, a forehead, retromicrognathia, large ears, and skeletal deformities with mild pectus carinatum, short and broad hands with brachydactyly, kyphosis, knock knees, valgus tibial bowing, and pes cavus foot (Figures 1(a)-1(d)), and her height was 102 cm (2.9 SDs), weight was 16 kg, and head circumference was 48 cm below the third percentile. The radiological findings (Figures 2(a)-2(d)) coincided with the clinical findings. The radiological analysis revealed diffuse osteopenia. Tubular bones are short. Metaphyseal sclerosis and irregularities are more pronounced in the lower limbs. Right humerus bowing deformity; small, fragmented, and sclerotic femoral heads; right hip dislocation with external rotation of the right lower limb; bilateral coxa varus; and left genu valgus bowing deformity of the left tibia were identified. Metacarpals and metatarsals are short. The echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable. She had an intellectual disability (IQ = 60) and lived alone. No corneal cataract, hearing deficit, or involvement of other systems was identified.\\nInvestigations included complete blood count; coagulation profile; GAG (glycosaminoglycans) in the urine, urea, and electrolytes; thyroid function tests; parathyroid hormone; serum calcium; phosphorus; and alkaline phosphatase.\\nMagnesium, vitamin D, and liver enzymes were normal. Unremarkable Tandom MS was found, and urine organic acid analysis was performed. Lysosomal enzyme activities were analyzed and showed elevated enzyme activity levels for alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-mannosidase, alpha-mannosidase, and beta-hexosaminidase.\\nWeS was performed on the proband and her parents utilizing genomic DNA extract from blood. Genomic DNA is enzymatically fragmented, and target regions are enriched using DNA capture probes. These regions include approximately 41 Mb of the human coding exome (targeting >98% of the coding RefSeq from the human genome build GRCh37/hg19), as well as the mitochondrial genome. The generated library is sequenced on an Illumina platform to obtain at least 20x coverage depth for >98% of the targeted bases. An in-house bioinformatics pipeline, including read alignment to the GRCh37/hg19 genome assembly and revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) of the Human Mitochondrial DNA (NC_012920), variant calling, annotation, and comprehensive variant filtering, is applied. All variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 1% in the gnomAD database, as well as disease-causing variants reported in HGMD , ClinVar, or CentoMD  are considered. The investigation for relevant variants is focused on coding exons and flanking +-10 intronic nucleotides of genes with clear gene-phenotype evidence (based on OMIM  information). All potential patterns for the mode of inheritance are considered. In addition, provided family history and clinical information are used to evaluate identified variants with respect to their pathogenicity and causality. Variants are categorized into five classes (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign, and benign) according to ACMG guidelines for classification of variants. All relevant variants related to the phenotype of the patient are reported. CENTOGENE has established stringent quality criteria and validation processes for variants detected by NGS. Variants with low quality and/or unclear zygosity are confirmed by orthogonal methods. Consequently, a specificity of >99.9% for all reported variants is warranted. Mitochondrial variants are reported to have heteroplasmy levels of 15% or higher.\\nThe copy number variation (CNV) detection software has a sensitivity of more than 95% for all homozygous/hemizygous and mitochondrial deletions, as well as heterozygous deletions/duplications and homozygous/hemizygous duplications spanning at least three consecutive exons. For uniparental disomy (UPD) screening, a specific algorithm is used to assess the well-known clinically relevant chromosomal regions (6q24, 7, 11p15.5, 14q32, 15q11q13, 20q13, and 20).\\nThe patient's entire exome sequence was discovered to be a homozygous (c.2634C > A) p. (Ser878Arg) variant of the MBTPS1 gene (Figure 3). An amino acid change from Ser to Arg at position 878. It is classified as a variant of uncertain significance (class 3) according to the recommendations of CENTOGENE and ACMG, and further Sanger sequencing indicated that the parents carried a single heterozygous mutation each. The missense c.2634C > A variant in the MBTPS1 gene has not been previously reported in clinical cases and was classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (class 3) according to the CENTOGENE and ACMG. The Kondo-Fu type of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDKF) is caused by a homozygous mutation in the MBTPS1 gene. The autosomal recessive Kondo-Fu type of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDKF) is consistent with the genetic diagnosis of the autosomal recessive Kondo-Fu type of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SEDKF). Variable clinical phenotypes include short stature, developmental delay, eye abnormalities, and skeletal dysplasia. We are aware of the paper published by Kondo et al.. They report cases of MBTPS1 variants identified by compound heterozygosity for mutations in the MBTPS1 gene: a 1-bp duplication and a missense mutation.

Both showed an intact unremarkable mucosal surface without inflammation. The transition from small nests of Brunner's glands and other submucosal elements to a multinodular proliferation composed entirely of closely spaced Brunner's glands was also noted (Figure 4). On follow-up one month after resection, the patient's hemoglobin level normalized and he no longer required iron supplementation.\\nWhile Brunner's gland hamartomas are rare, with an incidence of 0.008%, they also account for 5-10% of all benign duodenal tumors. These lesions usually present in the fifth or sixth decade of life and have low malignant potential. Brunner's gland hamartomas are usually 1-3 cm in size, so our case was unusual with a large 12-cm Brunner's gland, which was successfully removed by means of transduodenal resection. Interestingly, although the patient's gastric biopsies did not show evidence of Helicobacter pylori, there has been an association of Brunner's gland hamartomas with concurrent H. pylori infections. In one study, dysplastic changes were noted in 2.1% of cases, with only 0.3% of those being invasive carcinoma. Treatment for Brunner's gland hamartomas is usually conservative in asymptomatic patients, while surgical or endoscopic resection is indicated for symptomatic patients.\",\n",

The onset of symptoms was spontaneous; there was no history of trauma. No history of lumbago, no fever or weight loss. The symptoms were reported for the first time. The current medication comprised antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and an anticoagulans (cumarine). The patient reported a biologic aortal valve implantation from 6 months ago and an atrial fibrillation as a reason for the anticoagulation.\\nOn physical examination, we had an adipose female patient with a height of 165cm and weight of 95kg (BMI= 34.9). The mental status was normal. During the examination, the patient was asked to stand up for the purpose of inspection. While trying to get into a prone position, the patient lost control of her left lower limb. At this moment she also suffered urine incontinence the first time. Further examination presented an incomplete paraplegia of the lower limb, while the right limb had a normal motor and sensible function. On the left side, there was a loss of power for the hip flexion, knee extension and foot elevation, varying from 4/5 MRC (medical research council) grade to full plegia (Asia Impairment Scale AIS D to AIS C) and inability to move the limb during a second examination, which was performed 15 minutes later in the radiology department by the same examiner.

On 13/09, he was admitted to the hospital \"S. Maria\" of Terni for persistence of left ear pain and complete hearing loss in the absence of fever or other symptoms. A computerized tomography (CT) of the left ear without contrast medium documented \"thickening of the walls of the external auditive canal, marked thickening of the tympanic membrane, and the ossicular chain conglobated by inflammatory material\" (Figure 1).\\nThereafter, antibiotic therapy with ertapenem was administered once daily in the day-ospital regimen, and it continued for eight days with no benefit because of persistent pain and hearing loss of the left ear. The blood exams showed nonsignificant values of C-reactive protein and white blood cells (WBC) because the patient took immunosuppressive therapy. Then, on 28/09, the patient was hospitalized at our department, and a brain MRI without and with contrast medium showed \"in correspondence of the petrous rock and the mastoid on the left, a nonhomogeneous hyperintensity in the long TR sequences, compatible with the presence of flogistic tissue\" (Figure 2).\\nDuring admission, he was initially treated with empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy with imipenem 500 mg/8 h and linezolid 600 mg/12 h.

Only patients aged 18-90 years with CJD who met the proposed diagnostic criteria were included. The information collected and analyzed from patients included: sex, age at onset of CJD, age of death, disease duration, symptoms at onset, and examination findings.\\nThe clinical features of the patients are summarized in Table 1. Ages at onset of CJD ranged from 60 to 66 years (mean age was 61.75 years), and the group included two women and two men. They did not have any history of contacting a source of infection or related CJD family history. All patients experienced characteristics of a progressive dementia within <2 years; for example, patients 1, 3, and 4 did not recognize their family members and could not recall their home address. Moreover, all patients had myoclonus, ataxia, and extrapyramidal or pyramidal signs during disease progression, and either visual disturbances or akinetic mutism developed in the other two patients. All patients were admitted to hospital with obvious symptoms of dementia.\\nAfter admission, cerebral CT as well as T1- and T2-weighted cerebral MRI were performed in all patients, and no apparent abnormalities were identified. Lumbar puncture was also performed, and there were no positive results in the routine laboratory tests, biochemical indicators, complete viral testing, histologic staining, oligoclonal bands (OB) testing, or autoimmune encephalitis antibodies in CSF. However, abnormal high signal in two or more cerebral cortex regions, referred to as \"cortical ribboning\" (Figure 1), and/or the basal ganglia, was incidentally found in the DWI of all four patients, which alerted physicians to suspect a diagnosis of CJD. These patients were all subsequently recommended to undergo the following tests: DWI, EEG, and laboratory CSF analysis; two of them also underwent a brain biopsy. Testing performed by China DCD (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) for CSF 14-3-3 protein were positive in all patients. However, tests for other CSF biomarkers such as total tau protein, S100B, neuronal specific enolase and amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42 were not performed because these assays were not widely used in Chinese hospitals at the time. Patients 1 and 3 had characteristic period sharp wave complexes (PSWCs; Figure 2) recorded by EEG. And atypical little sharp waves, instead of PSWCs, were identified in the EEG trace of patient 4. Additionally, upon consideration of the risk of brain surgery, only two patients (#1 and #4) underwent a brain biopsy, which in both cased demonstrated prominent spongiform changes and neuronal loss in the gray matter of the brain. PrPSc protein was also detected in the living brain tissue by western blotting. Moreover, prion protein (PRNP) genetic testing in the four patients did not reveal any pathogenic mutation. In light of the typical clinical features, the presence of \"cortical ribboning\" on DWI, 14-3-3 protein in CSF, PSWCs on the EEG, and the results of brain biopsy, all four patients were diagnosed with sCJD; two (#1, #4) were confirmed cases and the other two (#2, #3) were probable cases. There were no specific treatments available for CJD. The average time interval between the onset of CJD symptoms and death ranged from 4 to 12 months (average: 7.5 months).',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'Cox\\'s Bazar, in Bangladesh, comprises a large refugee population spread across 34 highly congested subcamps along the Bangladesh/Myanmar border. The international response coordination in Cox\\'s Bazar is managed under a situation specific mechanism led by a Strategic Executive Group at the national level and through the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) in Cox\\'s Bazar. The ISCG comprised ten sectors and six inter sector working groups that provide humanitarian assistance to close to 900,000 Rohingya refugees. The WHO Emergency Sub-office in Cox\\'s Bazar, in collaboration the district level health administration, chairs the Health Sector of the ISCG.\\nGuided by the WHO Emergency Response Framework, WHO Bangladesh established an incident management system soon after the largest influx of refugees from Myanmar in 2017 that effectively managed many outbreaks and natural disasters prior to COVID-19. Both the WHO incident management system and the ISCG were leveraged for COVID-19, highlighting the benefit of having existing mechanisms using a whole-of society response for emergencies. The COVID-19 response was also extended to the entire population of Cox\\'s Bazar district.\\nPrior to the first COVID-19 cases in the district, a COVID-19 response plan was developed that outlined key activities across 11 identified thematic pillars of the national COVID-19 response plan. A dedicated COVID-19 related Crisis Management Team for Cox\\'s Bazar was established, initially comprised of the UN Resident Coordinator and Heads of Agencies of WHO, International Organization for Migration (IOM), UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), UNICEF, and WFP as well as the Head of Sub-office of WHO and the senior coordinator of ISCG. This forum enabled frequent and direct interagency decision making and was a key facilitator of operational decision-making between the field and national decision makers.\\nThe response to COVID-19 in Cox\\'s Bazar provides many examples of how WHO supported whole-of-society COVID-19 activities. World Health Organization provided technical updates to the Heads of UN agencies and the ISCG, and between UN agencies, local community groups, donors/partners, and embassies to facilitate decision making, allocate resources, and mobilize funds. In collaboration with the technical working groups, the health sector developed an orientation package and online awareness training sessions for healthcare workers to ensure mainstreaming of cross-cutting themes including gender, protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, gender-based violence, protection, and child protection in the response. Prior to the reopening of the destination for domestic tourism, in collaboration with local government, WHO provided technical advice, training, and information materials on operating safely within the COVID-19 context to various sectors, including the tourism, agriculture, and livelihood sectors.\\nOne unique example of the role of WHO in the whole-of-society response to COVID-19 in Cox\\'s Bazar was the provision of technical advice and coordination for repurposing Rohingya volunteers involved in garment manufacturing and tailoring as livelihoods activities to produce cloth face masks. World Health Organization\\'s role in this initiative was to provide the specifications for the fabric masks, the quality standards for local production, and in collaboration with the livelihood sector partners including UNHCR, IOM, and WFP, the government counterparts including the district\\'s Civil Surgeon and regulatory authority, support the system for UN agencies that normally work with the production sector. More than one million masks were made and distributed in the camps and nearby community. This initiative contributed to the health response and improved the refugees\\' micro economy.\\nRestriction to the camps was another challenge for the whole-of-society response as many volunteers from non-health sectors such as protection, education, and nutrition were unable to continue their work. To overcome this challenge, WHO utilized these volunteer networks in partnership with the other UN agencies for health activities, which also enabled their usual volunteer roles. The volunteers contributed to the community surveillance system established prior to COVID-19, referred cases for testing and treatment, assisted with vaccination programs, and provided the backbone of RCCE. With partners, WHO provided training for 3,600 humanitarian workers and over 2,000 volunteers involved in the COVID-19 response on how to protect themselves from COVID-19 while working. By June 2020, every household was visited once a week by these community volunteers.\\nThe training provided to the volunteer networks enabled RCCE efforts as the volunteers disseminated these messages whilst completing their usual work. This intersectoral involvement in RCCE successfully alleviated the infodemic within the camp, as evidenced by improved outpatient attendance and health seeking behavior of the population. The RCCE feedback loop was also supported by WHO, as it enabled structured feedback to the government, UN agencies, and non-government partners at national and local level to improve the response. In collaboration with partners, messages were also delivered by WHO staff through weekly audio podcast program on local radios.\\nUzbekistan is a middle-income country in central Asia that has a UN interagency presence with a UNCT that comprises 24 UN agencies. World Health Organization works closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH), and prior to COVID-19, established Health Development Partnership meetings to facilitate communication between the UNCT, non-UN development partners, and the government.\\nA UN Crisis Management Team for COVID-19 was established and was co-chaired by WHO. The Crisis Management Team operated according to the national SPRP and the UN framework for the socio-economic response to COVID-19 in Uzbekistan. World Health Organization led the SPRP, contributed to the combined UN/WHO sitreps, was a co-chair of most COVID-19 related meetings, and a vital part of the UN decision making process. This further increase the visibility and added value of WHO within the UN system in Uzbekistan.\\nThere were six COVID-19 taskforces led by the UN and the government: capacity building, procurement, human rights and vulnerable groups, economic and social impact, education, and risk communication. World Health Organization led the capacity building taskforce and had a presence in all others. By MOH request, WHO was the liaison between the MOH and other UN agencies and the conduit between the COVID-19 taskforces. The Health Development Partnership meetings continued as the intersectoral communication and collaboration mechanism between the UN, non-UN partners, and government. World Health Organization presented technical information to each taskforce as needed and reviewed taskforce documents prior to distribution to the government:a \"translator.\" The COVID-19 response cemented that intersectoral collaboration is crucial for advancing the health agenda with WHO as a key contributor.\\nOne example of WHO working across the whole-of-society response in Uzbekistan was in the education taskforce. Working closely with UNICEF and the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), WHO contributed to technical guidance on school closures, required school infrastructure, such as building ventilation and the safe reopening of schools. Information, education, and communication materials were developed in collaboration with the MOH, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Pre-School Education with more than 6 million children in schools, 1.4 million children in pre-schools, 2 million parents received information, and 14,000 preschool institutions receiving materials.\\nOnline training mechanisms developed by WHO, in conjunction with the MOH Post Graduate Medical Institute, allowed experts to train large groups of healthcare workers in the public and private sector from across Uzbekistan (500 people per session) on COVID-19 related issues and topics, with the training materials made available to partners outside of the health sector.',\n",

There were left eye ptosis and decrement of left nasolabial fold in patient's face. The patient had tremor and truncal ataxia. The force of the extremities and deep tendon reflexes were normal in physical examination. Her heart rate was 110 min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg and temperature 38.2  C. The patient's weight was 21 kg and had 133 cm height and head circumference was 52 cm. The patient had no history of head trauma. \\nAn informed consent was obtained from her parents in order to publish data as a case report without publishing her name. Ethics Committee of the university approved the study.\\n Diagnostic focus and assessment: \\nThe patient underwent a brain CT scan without contrast in first day of admission preceded by CBC, diff, BUN, Cr, Na, K, Arterial blood gas sampling (ABG) and Urine analysis. On the second day, brain magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with flair, T1, T2 and DWI sequences and also EEG were ordered, then lumbar puncture with 3 samples was carried out. About 48 h after the MRI the patient became aggressive and had severe headache, nausea and vomiting plus ataxia and delirium, then the patient transferred to PICU and we decided to order the second CT scan and after the results, we asked for urgent neurosurgery consultation and the patient was prepared for brain surgery. The day after surgery the patient underwent brain CT scan without contrast again and laboratory tests were repeated. The patient underwent the last brain CT scan without contrast on thirteenth day and also had an EEG on the same day. We also did a portable echocardiography plus electrocardiography to determine presence of any PFO or ASD or any cardiac problems.\\n Therapeutic focus and assessment: The patient presented with sudden onset of headache and recurrent vomiting, ataxia, and history of 3 consecutive days of fever and malaise. Our first clinical suspicion was cerebellitis or post infectious ataxia (Figure 1) so we ordered intravenous ceftriaxone, intravenous pantoprazole, and ondansetron for two days. We also ordered acyclovir ampule plus dexamethasone ampule for the patient and after the brain MRI results that were consistent with cerebellar infarction aspirin tablet was prescribed for the patient. On the fourth day (48 h after) because of the patient's severe headache, intravenous acetaminophen was administered and dexamethasone was held and the patient was transferred to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and intravenous phenytoin ampule plus vancomycin ampule were prescribed. After the brain CT, because of obstructive hydrocephaly arising from cytotoxic edema mannitol and dexamethasone ampule were ordered for the patient and the patient became ready for the brain surgery. The next day after the surgery and inserting a drain in the left lateral ventricle, mannitol was discontinued. The day after, phenytoin ampule was held and Diamox tablet (acetazolamide) was ordered. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy of the left extremities begun for the patient and because of constipation lactulose syrup were ordered. \\n Follow-up and outcomes \\nThe first EEG report was mildly abnormal due to some spike and wave discharges (Figure 2 Left) and in the last EEG report, there were some background attenuations without epileptiform activity (Figure 2 Right). The patient had a lumbar puncture with normal result. The first and the last laboratory data are as follows (Table-1)\\nThe urine analysis result was normal. The HPLC Amino Acid profile was normal except lower than normal range of arginine (26.8) and higher than normal range of alanine (148.0). We also obtained an Arterial Blood Gas sample from the patient that was normal (Table 1). The echocardiography and electrocardiography results both were normal. Findings on the first brain CT scan were a dim hypodensity in the left cerebellar hemisphere accompanied by a mild generalized ventriculomegaly (Figure 3 Left). The MRV's result was also normal (Figure 4 Right). In the MRI report, there were abnormal low T1 and high T2 signal intensity in left cerebellar hemisphere involving superior and middle cerebellar peduncles in the same side as well (Figure 3 Right , Figure 4 Middle), restriction was noted in this region. DWI findings were consistent with cerebellar infarction in this region (Figure 4 Left). On the second brain CT scan that was 48 h after the MRI, there was an intense hypodensity arising from cytotoxic edema in the left cerebellar hemisphere with concomitant cortical entanglement exerted pressure on fourth ventricle and had resulted in hydrocephaly, severe ventriculomegaly was also seen in the CT scan (Figure 5 Left) . On the third brain CT which was after the patient's surgery, there were evidence of craniotomy in occipital bone on the left side and hemispherectomy of the left hemisphere of the cerebellum, the drain in the left lateral ventricle was in its appropriate position (Figure 5 Middle). The last brain CT scan had no new findings and the drain was extracted from the brain (Figure 5 Right). Pathology result of surgical biopsy of brain tissue was cerebellar tissue with small foci of hemorrhage accompanied by presence of vascular malformation, most probably venous angioma.\\nAfter 5 months the force of the extremities was normal and the ataxia was completely disappeared. The patient now goes to school and has no problems in daily life activities. The patient is now under treatment with an aspirin 80 mg tablet daily.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 47-year-old Caucasian woman with a nonsignificant medical history presented with generalized chronic severe periodontitis with secondary occlusal trauma (Figure 1).\\nPrimary etiologic factors included heavy accumulation of plaque and calculus, with secondary factors including defective restorations and occlusal trauma. She presented with cyanotic edematous gingiva, severe clinical attachment loss, and mucogingival defects and recession. Upon occlusal evaluation, it was revealed that the maxillary midline coincided with the facial midline, with horizontal overlap of 1 mm and vertical overlap of 2 mm. Smile analysis revealed that the patient had an average smile line and maxillary incisal edges did not follow the curvature of the lower lip (Figure 2). Centric occlusion to maximum intercuspation discrepancy was found to be 1 mm forward.\\nThe patients' final treatment plan included full mouth rehabilitation through a staged approach with guided implant surgery. The final implant abutments were selected on the guided software in areas # 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14 for the maxilla and 19, 21, 23, 26, 28, and 30 for the mandible. The case was treatment-planned to be staged using selected maxillary teeth # 6, 11, and 13 and the mandibular teeth # 20, 22, 27, and 29 to be retained as abutments for a fixed temporary prosthesis with a transitional removable prosthesis (Figure 3).\\nThe first phase of the periodontal treatment plan included oral hygiene instruction and full mouth supragingival debridement, followed by root planning with subgingival irrigation with chlorhexidine gluconate on the temporary abutment teeth. The criteria for the retention of these teeth included decreased mobility and probing depths and a favorable prognosis compared to the remaining hopeless teeth. Selected teeth were prepared and single unit provisional crowns were fabricated using temporary acrylic material (Alike, GC America Inc., Alsip, IL) and cemented with temporary cement (Tempbond NE, Kerr Manufacturing Co., Romulus, MI). At the re-evaluation visit, the patient presented with significantly improved oral hygiene and a reduced plaque index.\\nUpon phase 1 re-evaluation, the first surgical phase of the treatment included extraction of hopeless maxillary and mandibular teeth, utilizing GBR with mineralized crushed cortical bone (RegenerOss Allograft, Biomet 3i) and a resorbable collagen membrane (OsseoGuard Flex, Biomet 3i) for the deficient extraction socket areas, # 3, 7 to 10, 23 to 26, 21, and 28. Tooth # 5 was selected for extraction and GBR with tenting screw technology as part of the maxillary grafting procedures (Figure 4).\\nPeriosteal releasing incisions were followed by horizontal mattress and single interrupted Vicryl 4.0 sutures, stabilizing the flap and achieving primary closure. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg every eight hours for 7 days, chlorhexidine gluconate rinse twice a day for 2 weeks, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (ibuprofen 600 mg, q4-6 h) for 7 days postoperatively, and 2 grams of amoxicillin premedication. Preparation for full coverage restoration was finalized and preliminary alginate impressions (Jeltrate Plus, Dentsply Caulk, York, PA) were made to create diagnostic casts. Record bases with occlusal rims were fabricated on the diagnostic casts, which were mounted on semiadjustable articulator (Hanau Wide Vue, Whip Mix, Fort Collins, CO) using facebow transfer and centric relation records. Intraoral protrusive record was made to program the horizontal condylar inclination. The lateral condylar inclination was calculated based on Hanau formula (L = H/8 + 12). The result of the formula was used to program the lateral condylar inclination on the articulator. Full mouth diagnostic setup using denture teeth was completed on the mounted casts. The casts with diagnostic setup were duplicated and provisional fixed prostheses were then fabricated and cemented on abutments teeth # 6, 11, and 13 with a cantilever pontic # 5 for the maxillary arch. The initial set of temporary prostheses was delivered immediately after extraction of the hopeless maxillary and mandibular teeth. It was used as a template for adjustments in order to arrive at optimized esthetics, phonetics, and function before fabrication of metal-reinforced laboratory processed provisional prosthesis. Bilateral internal sinus lifts in the areas # 3 and 14 and implant placement were scheduled in 3 months. Abutment teeth # 20, 22, 27, and 29 were used to retain a mandibular fixed provisional prosthesis (Figure 5).\\nAfter 3 months of uneventful healing, another set of provisional fixed prostheses for improved esthetics, phonetics, function, and strength were fabricated. Alginate impressions were made for the previously optimized provisional prostheses and prepared teeth. Alginate impressions were poured in dental stone. The casts of the maxillary and mandibular prepared teeth were cross-mounted to the casts of the optimized provisional prosthesis. Denture teeth were set on the casts of prepared teeth, which were hollowed out from the palatal/lingual aspect to accommodate the prepared teeth and create space for the metal frames that were cast with beads to retain denture teeth and temporary acrylic material (Alike, GC America Inc., Alsip, IL). The metal-reinforced provisional prostheses were relined with acrylic material and cemented over abutment teeth using temporary cement (Tempbond NE, Kerr Manufacturing Co., Romulus, MI). Interim removable partial dentures were delivered to replace the missing posterior teeth for better esthetics and function.\\nThe provisional fixed prostheses were evaluated and adjusted periodically, if needed, to enhance esthetics and phonetics. Alginate impressions were made from the provisional fixed prostheses, which were then removed, and another set of alginate impressions were made of the prepared abutment teeth. The casts were then cross-mounted on a semiadjustable articulator. Mucosa-tooth supported radiographic guides were fabricated over the prepared teeth using orthodontic resin (Dentsply International Inc., Milford, DE) mixed with barium sulfate for the teeth and orthodontic resin only for the denture base. Straumann templiX reference plates, containing three titanium reference pins, were attached to the radiographic guides where Straumann gonyX was used to record reference pins orientation.\\nThe second surgical phase initiated with CBCT evaluation and treatment planning of restoratively dictated implant positions. The reference pins were detected on the coDiagnostiX software. The match between the software planning and the reference pins on the radiographic guides was ensured. The radiographic guides were fitted back on the casts of prepared teeth. The casts were remounted on Straumann gonyX using previous reference pins orientation. The radiographic guides were then converted to surgical guides with addition of metal sleeves based on spatial position and depth information provided by coDiagnostiX software. A flapless approach and CBCT guided surgery with tooth-stabilized mucosa-supported surgical guides for minimally invasive intervention were the treatment of choice. Two-staged bone level SLActive titanium implants were placed at # 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 sites in the maxilla and at # 19, 21, 23, 26, 28, and 30 positions in the mandible. The canine positions in the mandible were not considered as potential implant sites because there was enough bone quantity at the lateral incisors position, which provided proper implant distribution in the arch. Additionally, six implants were enough to support mandibular implant fixed prosthesis due to favorable bone quality in mandible (types I-II) as apposed to maxilla (types III-IV). The mandibular definitive prosthesis was planned to be splinted using precision attachments. At this stage preventive maintenance of the abutment teeth for the temporary prosthesis was, also, performed.\\nStaging the case allowed for a novel technique for sinus lift procedures through a surgical guide using Salvin/Drew osteotomes (Figure 6).\\nThe CBCT evaluation revealed 7.0 mm of residual bone in areas 3 and 14. Ideal implant placement indicated bilateral sinus lifts at the areas of 3 and 14 and simultaneous ridge expansion through the surgical guide, utilizing the Salvin osteotomes # 2.6, 3.1, and 3.8 mm and the intermediary Salvin/Drew osteotomes 2.6 and 3.1 mm. The intermediary osteotomes were tapped through cortical crestal bone to ensure that the Salvin osteotomes engaged the site. It should be noted that as soon as Salvin/Drew osteotomes reach the initial hub, the next Salvin osteotome can be engaged. The Salvin osteotome # 3.8 mm was then tapped to the final length of 1 mm from the sinus floor. To ensure the final length is accurate, the operator needs to consider the height of the soft tissue and the height of the sleeve in the surgical guide, through which the osteotome is inserted. For site 14, planning on the software revealed 7.0 mm of residual ridge, 5.0 mm in height of the guide sleeve, and the 6.0 mm in soft tissue height. The final length on the last osteotome of 17.0 mm was marked with a stop cylinder, when used through the surgical guide. The guide could now be easily removed. The osteotomy was filled with bone graft material (Bio-Oss, Osteohealth) and osteotome # 3.8 mm was pushed 1.0 mm from the floor of the sinus. The authors recommend using the osteotome with particulate graft material, when the concave tip of the osteotome is 1 mm coronal to the sinus floor. Using this protocol, the graft material, and not the osteotome, is elevating the sinus. The addition of bone graft material was repeated 4 times until the desired length of 17.0 mm was achieved, resulting in a 4 mm internal lift.\\nFor the prepared osteotomy at site # 14 an SLActive 4.8 x 10 mm was planned to be placed, but due to lack of initial stability a 6 x 10 mm MTX microtextured surface implant was eventually placed. Utilizing the same technique for site # 3 we achieved an increase of 5.0 mm in height which allowed us to place as planned a 4.1 mm x 12.0 mm SLActive implant. Utilizing a tooth-borne surgical guide enabled an easy removal of the guide and radiographic evaluation with 2 periapical X-rays to confirm adequate sinus elevation at sites # 3 and 14. The provisional fixed prostheses were then cemented back, which was an advantage of staging the treatment. The provisional pontic areas above the implants were relieved slightly to allow for minor swelling (Figure 7).\\nPre-operative medications for the guided surgery and the simultaneous sinus lifts were prescribed 1 hour before the appointment included 2 grams of amoxicillin and 2 tablets of an Medrol dose pack. Postoperative medications that included amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours for 7 days, chlorhexidine gluconate rinse twice a day for 2 weeks, Tylenol # 3 every 4 hours as needed for 7 days, and Medrol dose pack (methylprednisolone 4 mg) were prescribed.\\nAfter 3 months, all the implants were uncovered and periodontal plastic surgery, with partial thickness flaps, 2 vertical releasing incisions, and an apically positioned flap, was performed for site 3 and the mandibular molar areas due to lack of attached gingiva (Figure 8). This inadequate attached gingiva is common postextraction/GBR, where the mucogingival junction is advanced coronally to achieve closure. Implant level impressions were made for maxillary and mandibular implants which were then poured and mounted against the previous mounted casts of provisional prostheses. Screw-retained provisional prostheses were fabricated with apical pink acrylic to avoid excessively long nonesthetic prostheses. The abutment teeth # 13, 20, 22, 27, and 29 were extracted and augmented with mineralized crushed cortical bone (RegenerOss Allograft, Biomet 3i) and a resorbable collagen membrane (OsseoGuard Flex, Biomet 3i). The screw-retained provisional prostheses were delivered at this point (Figure 9).\\nAdditionally, flapless immediate one-stage bone level SLActive implants were placed at # 6 and # 11 extraction sockets, through the surgical guide. Peri-implant augmentation with mineralized crushed cortical bone, prior to healing abutment placement, was performed. The sites were stabilized with Vicryl 4-0 sutures after easy removal of the mucosal-tooth-borne guide (Figure 10).\\nScrew-retained prostheses were hollowed in positions # 6 and 11 and temporary cylinders were attached to the immediately placed one-stage implants # 6 and 11. The cylinders were picked up intraorally using temporary acrylic material (Alike, GC America Inc., Alsip, IL). The provisional fixed prostheses were finished and polished around newly added temporary cylinders and delivered back to the patient (Figures 11 and 12).\\nSix weeks allowed for healing around immediately placed implants # 6 and 11. Fixture level impressions were taken for maxillary and mandibular implants and poured in dental stone (Silky Rock, Whip mix) for master casts. The master casts were then cross-mounted against the duplicate cast of corrected implant retained provisional prostheses. The design of the definitive prostheses involved screw-retained porcelain fused to metal for ease of retrievability when needed on follow-up visits. The use of cast metal frame, which is an integral part of the definitive prosthesis, allows predictable sectioning and soldering in case of misfit upon try-in stage and provides high strength while giving enough space for porcelain to get an excellent esthetic outcome. The maxillary and mandibular definitive prostheses were designed in 3 separate sections in each arch. The provisional and the definitive prostheses were fabricated with even posterior teeth contacts in centric jaw position, anterior guidance in protrusion, and canine guidance with immediate posterior disocclusion on lateral eccentric movements. Since 6 implants were placed for the mandible, the definitive prostheses had precision attachments on the distal aspects of the mandibular canines. Designing the prostheses with multiple sections allows for easier maintenance and management of future prosthetic complications. Post-insertion management includes delivery of night guard and follow-up visits every 3-4 months for the first year and then every 6 months thereafter.\",\n",

The mass was excised, and gross examination revealed a hard, whitish, subcutaneous lesion with infiltrative borders. The lesion measured 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopic examination revealed a highly cellular neoplasm composed of closely packed, atypical spindle cells with scant cytoplasm, nuclear hyperchromasia, and brisk mitotic and apoptotic activity. A prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vascular pattern was observed (Figure 1). Moreover, a fibrosarcoma-like fascicular pattern was focally identified. Lymphovascular invasion was also observed. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for TTF1, synaptophysin, and chromogranin, but were negative for S100 and BCL2. The Ki67 proliferative index was approximately 80% (Figure 2). Small cell carcinoma was the preferred diagnosis.

Initial labs were notable for a sodium 107 and a white blood cell count of 17.7. She was admitted for severe symptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia which improved with one bolus of hypertonic saline and tube feeds. Initial chest x-ray (Fig. 1) showed no signs of consolidation. However, over the next 36 hours, she developed acute hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. Left subclavian central venous line was attempted and was complicated by left sided pneumothorax (Fig. 2). Considering this image and patient's clinical presentation, aspiration pneumonitis was considered. Her interval chest x-ray later showed a worsening right middle and lower lobe consolidation (Fig. 3), concerning for pneumonia. She treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and later escalated to Vancomycin and Cefepime for empiric treatment of community and hospital associated pneumonia, respectively. She failed to improve clinically on both courses. Over the next 5 days, she developed a large loculated right sided pleural effusion demonstrated on chest CT and x-ray (Fig. 4). Pulmonology obtained a bronchoalveolar lavage that grew >100,000 CFU of Bordetella bronchiseptica, and she was placed on droplet precautions. Due to high coinfection rates in the literature, she was tested for HIV and COVID-19 which were both negative. Of note, the patient endorsed having two dogs and a cat that lives indoors. The patient underwent ultrasound guided thoracentesis with thoracostomy tube placement for drainage.

On clinical examination, he had anemia and his blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. After resuscitation, he underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which was normal. He also had a history of hematemesis for which he was evaluated with triphasic abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) (Figure 1). His abdominal CECT showed an 8x6 cm pseudocyst in the lesser sac with a 4x3 cm hyperdense area and multiple calcifications were observed in the pancreas. For the SAP, he underwent digital subtraction angiography embolization and celiac trunk angiography was performed during the procedure by puncturing the femoral artery using the Seldinger method. The splenic artery pseudoaneurysm was identified and a total of three coils were used for embolization (2 coils proximally and 1 coil distally) and no stents were used (Figure 2). Three weeks after embolization, the patient presented with hematemesis and hypovolemic shock. His abdominal CECT showed a giant splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with calcifications in the pancreatic parenchyma (Figure 3). The patient was resuscitated and prepared for exploratory laparotomy, given his clinical condition.\\nOn exploration, the patient's abdomen was filled with blood and clots, which were suctioned out. Opening the gastrocolic omentum revealed a thrombosed sac with diffuse bleeding visible from the outer wall of the sac, but no arterial spurt was identified from the sac. After opening the lesser sac, control of the supraceliac aorta was taken, but we were unable to reach the celiac axis and splenic artery proximally or distally because of dense adhesions. After obtaining supraceliac aorta control, we directly opened the sac and an arterial spurt was identified and ligated (Figure 4). Since the splenic vein was thrombosed, it was identified and ligated (Figure 5), followed by splenectomy. Pathology of the pancreas was suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Postoperatively, the patient had a grade A pancreatic fistula which was managed conservatively and he was discharged on day 7. Anticoagulation medications were not used postoperatively.

We obtained informed consents for chemotherapy and PBSC collection from all patients included in this analysis. The patients received repeated cycles of ICE (ifosfamide 9000 mg/m2, carboplatin 500 mg/m2, and etoposide 500 mg/m2) chemotherapy supported by autologous PBSC. Three patients had a single leukapheresis procedure following 2nd to 4th cycle of chemotherapy and G-CSF stimulation, and the product was split into four equal doses. In two patients (patients 2 and 4, Table 1), we used PBSCs obtained after leukapheresis procedures that did not collect required numbers of CD34+ cells to support myeloablative chemotherapy and otherwise would be discarded. The PBSCs were reinfused 24 hours after completion of consolidation chemotherapy cycles followed by G-CSF or GM-CSF stimulation. We used the number of days from the start of chemotherapy to ANC recovery to > 1000/mm3 to evaluate hematopoietic toxicity. We compared these data to induction chemotherapy cycles administered without PBSC support in the same patients. We used the Student's t-test to determine the significance of differences.\\nThe following is a short description of each patient's case:\\nPatient 1 was a 2-year-old male with stage 4 anaplastic Wilms' tumor whose metastatic lung disease was refractory to the first line of chemotherapy, and he was switched to ICE. He subsequently received 4 cycles of ICE chemotherapy with PBSC support after cycles 3 and 4. He had partial radiological response (PR) to chemotherapy and subsequently received high-dose melphalan with PBSC support; however, he developed a second disease recurrence 3 months after transplant.\\nPatient 2 was a 17-year-old female with stage 4 favorable histology Wilms' tumor who developed both pulmonary and abdominal recurrence 10 months after initial therapy. She was treated with abdominal tumor resection and 4 cycles of ICE chemotherapy with PBSC support after cycle 3 (an infusion of 0.3 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg from apheresis that did not collect required dose for myeloablative therapy was given). She had PR to chemotherapy. She then received high-dose thiotepa and melphalan with autologous bone marrow transplant. She developed recurrent disease 4 months after transplant.\\nPatient 3 was a 9-year-old male with stage 3 favorable histology Wilms' tumor who had pulmonary recurrence 13 months after his initial therapy and was treated with 6 cycles of ICE chemotherapy with PBSC support after cycles 3 through 6. He had PR to chemotherapy and was alive without signs of disease more than 10 years off therapy at the time of this report.\\nPatient 4 was a 1.5-year-old male with stage 3 Wilms' tumor abdominal recurrence. He underwent complete abdominal tumor resection and then received ICE chemotherapy as a consolidation with PBSC support after cycle 3 (an infusion of 1.8 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg from apheresis that did not collect required dose for myeloablative therapy was given). The patient was still under therapy at the time of this report.\\nPatient 5 was a 20-year-old female with metastatic PNET with primary abdominal tumor and multiple metastases to the lungs, lymph nodes, and vagina. She underwent abdominal surgeries and received ICE chemotherapy. She had very good partial response after the first two cycles but developed significant hematological toxicities after cycles 3 and 4 even with 30% chemotherapy dose reductions. She received her ICE cycles 5 and 6 at full dose followed by 0.82 x 106/kg CD34+ cells support per cycle and tolerated them well with significant reduction of hematological toxicity. The ANC recovery to > 1000/mm3 was on day 26 after cycle 4 and on day 17 after cycles 5 and 6. Platelet count recovery to > 50,000/mm3 was on day 29 after cycle 4 and on day 26 after cycles 5 and 6. She subsequently remained in remission for 7 months but developed metastatic recurrence thereafter and died of disease.\\nSevere myelosuppression was the main toxicity observed in all patients receiving ICE chemotherapy. The doses of infused CD34+ cells ranged 0.3 to 1.8 x 106/kg (mean 0.76 x 106/kg), and in 9 out of 10 PBSC infusions, the dose of CD34+ cells was below 1 x 106/kg (Table 1). In patients who started to receive PBSC support after their 3rd and subsequent cycles, there were no significant differences in ANC recovery between the first 2 induction cycles and the subsequent cycles given with PBSC support (17.6 days after cycles 1 and 2 versus 17.1 days after cycle 3 and subsequent cycles, p=0.28). All PBSC-supported cycles were given at the full planned doses.\",\n",

After careful assessment of the patient's skin involvement, the modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) score was determined to be roughly 40 %. Prior to seeking treatment from our facility, she tried topical steroid treatment, systemic therapy (romidepsin), and had received 3 courses of focal radiation treatments to doses of 44 Gy in 22 fractions with complete response in those fields. Upon initial discussion of TSEBT the patient expressed hesitation, as she did not want to lose her hair. She had no past or current clinical evidence of scalp involvement, and we assured her that accommodations were possible. We created a customized helmet using high-quality blue wax polyethylene material manufactured by .decimal (dotdecimal.com) to create a bolus type structure that would attenuate the majority of dose, and spare the underlying scalp.\\nOur beam is commissioned using 6 MeV electrons, and the expected energy at the patient's surface is roughly 4 MeV. Using commissioning data and percent depth dose curves, we estimated a 1.5 cm thick bolus helmet would be adequate to reduce the dose to the scalp to less than 10 percent.\\nOur patient underwent computerized tomography (CT) simulation to obtain the exact contour of her head. Her hairline was wired during the simulation. The CT scan was imported into our treatment planning system; and a standard body contour was created, with a 1.5 cm uniform expansion. From this, a 1.5 cm thick false structure was formed using the previously wired hairline for reference (Image 1). This false structure contour was then transferred to .decimal for manufacturing. Within five business days, we received the milled polyethylene helmet in two pieces. These pieces were combined using adhesive and tape to form the final helmet (Image 2). The patient presented the day before treatment for a dry run and the helmet fit snugly. We use the modified Stanford technique with 6 standing positions and eye shields, so we added a chin strap to ensure the helmet did not fall or move when the patient changed positions during treatment.\\nOn the first day of treatment, two nanoDot optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) were placed on top of the bolus helmet and two OSLDs under the bolus helmet. The readings from these were 84-86 % for the two OSLDS placed on top of the helmet versus 3.9-4.1 % for the two OSLDs placed immediately under the helmet. Using these measurements, the estimated total dose to her scalp was less than 0.5 Gy over the six fractions of treatment.\\nThe patient completed radiation treatment with good tolerance. She returned to the clinic one month and 6 months later with nearly a complete response of her skin disease (MSWAT 5 %) and no alopecia (Image 3).\",\n",

Physical examination was pertinent for fullness in the right flank and left supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings revealed hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 269,000 per mm3, and normal LDH of 147 IU/L. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis demonstrated a 12 cm heterogeneous right renal mass (Figure 1(a)) with retrocaval, aortocaval, and paraaortic lymphadenopathy.

Treatment with four cycles of dd-MVAC was associated with a significant reduction in size of renal mass from 9.3 cm to 5.9 cm with areas of necrosis on a CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1(b)). There was near-complete resolution of right upper lobe and left lower lobe parenchymal lung nodules and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Multiple pleural-based nodules in the left hemithorax and right hilar lymph node decreased. Two additional cycles of dd-MVAC were administered and a follow-up CT scan showed continued improvement in size of renal mass to 4.4 cm, improvement in retroperitoneal, hilar lymphadenopathy, and parenchymal lung lesions. The subject developed grade I renal insufficiency and grade II chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) for which the cisplatin dose was reduced by 25% after the initial two cycles. Overall, she tolerated six cycles of dd-MVAC extremely well, with no hospitalizations.\\nAfter achieving an excellent partial response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent right radical nephrectomy with complete, bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node dissection without complications. Pathology revealed a gross tumor resection size of 6.2 cm. Viable carcinoma comprised approximately 2-4% of the tumor volume showing neoplastic cells with rhabdoid features in a background of extensive fibrosis and chronic interstitial inflammation. All surgical margins were negative for tumor. Two of 11 lymph nodes (one paracaval and one preaortic from the level of the aortic bifurcation) were involved with carcinoma (0.7 cm in greatest dimension) with no extracapsular extension. Pathologic TNM stage was assessed as pT1b N1 M1. Immunohistochemistry revealed a complete loss of SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1 (SMARCB1) expression. Subsequently, she underwent video assisted thoracoscopy and wedge resection of right lower lung lobe. Pathology showed inflammatory changes with no evidence of residual malignancy.\\nFollow-up imaging in the form of CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis was obtained every four months and at one year from diagnosis she showed no recurrence of disease.

She had no medications at the time of the visit. There was no abnormality on physical examination. Computed tomography (CT) showed urachal remnant (urachal diverticulum at the dome of the bladder) and a large bladder diverticulum at the right lateral wall (Figures 1(a)-1(e)). Urine cytology was negative. Since she did not have any symptoms, she was followed up without therapeutic intervention. However, the residual urine had been increasing gradually, and she was referred to our hospital for continuous follow-up in February 2016. The postvoid residual urine was 150 ml at the time. After six months, she complained of severe dysuria and repeated urinary tract infection possibly caused by bladder diverticulitis. Cystoscopic examination showed a large diverticulum at the right wall, and diverticular mucosa was reddish and erosive (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)). Urachal diverticulum was small and without inflammation (Figure 2(b)). Antibiotic therapy with Levofloxacin was effective for UTI. She was started treatment with Urapidil of 30 mg/day simultaneously; however, the postvoid residual urine and dysuria did not improve.\\nWe performed bladder diverticulectomy and excision of urachal remnant simultaneously with the laparoscopic approach in August 2017. We cut out the umbilicus circumferentially with the umbilical ligament connected and then dropped into the abdominal cavity. The 12-mm camera port was placed in the umbilical hole. We prepared the five working ports (Figure 3(a)). Two were inserted at the height of the umbilicus on the bilateral middle clavicular line, and the other three were inserted at the inside of the right upper abdomen and outside of the bilateral lower abdomen. First, we inserted a camera into the right side working port of the umbilicus height and dissected the urachal ligament and adjacent tissues toward the bladder using the remaining right working port (Figure 3(b)). We transferred the camera to the central camera port and dissected the umbilical ligament until just above the bladder dome. We could confirm the bulging of the bladder diverticulum just to the right side of the bladder dome (Figure 3(c)). We used the cystoscopy to visualize the diverticular neck. The cystoscopic light could be observed from the abdominal cavity, and the bladder diverticulum was circumferentially resected at its neck. The resection line was extended to the bladder dome, and the urachal diverticulum was also resected (Figure 3(d)). The specimens were placed in an organ retrieval bag and removed through the 12-mm camera port site. The bladder defect was closed in 2 layers with a running 3-0 V-loc suture. The total operative time was 216 min with minimal blood loss.\\nThe Foley catheter was removed on the seventh postoperative day, and she was discharged home on the same day. For 18 months after the operation, she was able to void without residual urine, urinary tract infection ceased to develop, and had no recurrence of the diverticula (Figure 1(f)). Microscopic hematuria also disappeared.',\n",

The onset of these symptoms was related to a traumatic event in which she and her husband were simultaneously hospitalized for severe COVID-19, requiring critical care. Although the patient made a full recovery, her husband died, and due to her critical condition, she did not find out until several weeks later. In that previous consultation, she was diagnosed with a mixed anxiety-depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms for which treatment with antidepressants (sertraline 50 mg/day) and atypical antipsychotics (levomepromazine 5 drops/day) was started without an adequate response. The symptoms persisted after 6 weeks, even after the addition of a second antipsychotic (risperidone 2 mg/day). She reported being adherent to treatment and denied recreational drug use or other remarkable personal or familial psychiatric history.\\nAt the index admission, the mental examination revealed diminished language production, altered introspection, and paranoid delusions. The rest of the physical and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

However, the age and abruptness of onset, as well as the suboptimal response to medications, raised the suspicion of underlying organic pathology.\\nComputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed no abnormal findings. Laboratory workup ruled out infections and ingestions. Moreover, an upper gastric endoscopy was performed due to dysphagia and weight loss, ruling out malignancies and other anatomical defects. The metabolic panel was remarkable for an elevated corrected total calcium (13.21 mg/dL, normal: 8.6-10.3 mg/dL), confirmed with ionized calcium (1.8 mmol/L, normal: 1.15-1.30 mmol/L). A workup for hypercalcemia ruled out malignancies with a negative serum protein electrophoresis and a normal thoracoabdominal CT. pHPT was diagnosed based on an elevated PTH (396 pg/mL, normal: 14-55 pg/mL), a normal 24-h urinary calcium (224 mg/day, normal: 100-300 mg/day), and the incidental finding of nephrolithiasis in the abdominal CT (laboratory results are presented in Table 1).

She reported a 4-week history of intermittent, sharp, right upper quadrant pain that was worse after eating. When she developed scleral icterus, acholic stools, and dark urine, she presented for evaluation. Blood work revealed transaminitis (AST 322 U/L [normal 17-33 U/L], ALT 360 U/L [normal 8-24 U/L]) with a direct hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 7.2 mg/dL [normal 0.2-1 mg/dL], direct bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL [normal <0.3 mg/dL]), and elevated GGT (1,346 U/L [normal 10-21 U/L]). Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large, infiltrative central liver mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a poorly defined, T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense mass at the porta hepatis measuring 6 cm x 6.7 cm x 6.9 cm with distal biliary ductal dilatation. The left portal vein was not visualized in its course through the mass; the right portal vein demonstrated normal enhancement (shown in Fig. 1a, b). A chest computed tomography scan was notable only for a left lower lobe calcified granuloma, and a positron emission tomography scan revealed fluorodeoxyglucose avidity solely in the known hepatic mass. The patient underwent percutaneous biliary decompression and drain placement along with biopsy of the mass by interventional radiology. Pathologic evaluation of the biopsied tissue demonstrated immunohistochemical staining positive for CK7 (strong, diffuse), mucicarmine, CK19 (focal), CK56 (focal), and galectin-3 (focal) and staining negative for CK20, S100P, TTF-1, and CDX-2, which, in conjunction with morphologic features, confirmed the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (shown in Fig. 1c, d). The liver tumor was deemed unresectable due to its locally advanced nature. The patient therefore received standard cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with eight cycles of cisplatin-gemcitabine (cisplatin 25 mg/m2 followed by gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks). A partial response to chemotherapy was documented. She then underwent hypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy for definitive treatment (58.05 Gy [RBE] in 3.87 Gy [RBE] per fraction for a total of 15 fractions (shown in Fig. 1e, f)). The patient tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 nausea and fatigue that was transient. On follow-up imaging, her primary tumor remained stable.\\nThe patient enrolled in our institution's precision medicine study. Tumor tissue from the diagnostic biopsy was sent for comprehensive genomic sequencing (whole exome/paired normal and transcriptome sequencing) utilizing the GEM ExTra  assay (Ashion Analytics, Phoenix, AZ, USA). Details of the test methodology and clinical reporting have been published previously. Tumor tissue sequencing identified a novel, presumed oncogenic AGRN-NRG1 fusion between chromosome 1 (AGRN) and chromosome 8 (NRG1) with breakpoints within exon 2 of AGRN and intron 1 of NRG1 (shown in Fig. 2a). Based on our institution's molecular tumor board discussion, the patient was started on the oral pan-ERBB family inhibitor, afatinib, as a form of maintenance therapy. She continued on afatinib 40 mg daily with stable disease for 17 months with the main side effect being acneiform rash. The patient then experienced disease progression with development of three new, subcentimeter, satellite liver lesions. Biopsy of the largest lesion confirmed cholangiocarcinoma, and sequencing identified persistence of the AGRN-NRG1 fusion along with the development of a MCL1 amplification. Despite detection of 66 new genomic alterations, none were classified as driver events (shown in Fig. 2b). The patient subsequently chose to enroll in a clinical trial utilizing an anti-ERBB3 monoclonal antibody for NRG1-altered tumors.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The first patient was an 88-year-old male that was referred to our center for a 1 mm neuroendocrine tumor in the upper rectum at 14 cm from the anal verge. This lesion was first diagnosed and biopsied during a routine colonoscopy. This was staged as yT1N0M0 rectal lesion. The patient had no symptoms. Additional histological findings demonstrated a 1 mm lesion without mitoses, a ki67 index at 1.1% and most importantly, positive margins. On follow-up rigid proctosigmoidoscopy, the residual stellate scar, which was less than 1 cm, was confirmed to be at 14 cm from the anal verge in the left lateral position (Fig. 5).\\nAll treatment options were discussed with the patient including laparoscopic low anterior resection versus the less invasive trans-anal minimally invasive surgery. TAMIS procedure was selected for this patient. Given that the lesion was at 14 cm from the anal verge and therefore likely above the peritoneal reflection, a simple local excision could result in entering into the peritoneal cavity. Intraoperatively, the remaining scar was found to be mobile. It was therefore decided to proceed with the residual scar removal using a stapled technique. Echelon 60 and Endopath Flex 45 laparoscopic staplers were used, each with two reloads. The final pathology demonstrated only scar with no residual neuroendocrine tumour. The specimen was reported as full-thickness by the pathologist.\\nThe second patient was a slim 56 years old female with an endoscopically non-resectable tubular adenoma at 12 cm from the anal verge in the anterior position. Stapled TAMIS surgery was proposed for this patient. The Endopath Flex stapler with 2 blue cartridges was used. Due to the anterior position of the lesion, in addition to abdominal entry at 12 cm, another potential complications could be vaginal trauma. A mandatory maneuver in this situation therefore was to include identification of the recto-vaginal septum using digital manual inspection. Prior to firing the stapler, a finger was kept in the vagina to make sure that it was not pulled into the resection. An additional helpful maneuver is to develop a plane between the vagina and rectum by injecting 5-10cc of saline into the recto-vaginal septum. At the end of the excision in this case, the vagina was intact. Final pathology demonstrated a full-thickness excision, no malignancy and negative margins.\\nThe third patient was a 65-year-old female who had a recurrent serrated adenoma at 8 cm from the anal verge. Multiple attempts for removal under colonoscopy were unsuccessful. A pelvic MRI was performed. The MRI results featured an anterior 1.2 cm rectal lesion with concerns of invasion into the anterior mesorectal fascia (possible stage T4 lesion). However, there was no obvious pelvic lymphadenopathy or evidence of vascular involvement. Furthermore, there was no invasion or malignancy demonstrated on extensive biopsy. On digital rectal examination, the lesion appeared very mobile and smooth. It was therefore believed that the MRI findings could have been secondary to scarring due to prior endoscopic resections and biopsies rather than due to the presence of an advanced cancer. The diagnostic dilemma was discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting and reviewed with the patient. A decision was made to proceed with excision using the TAMIS platform. This was to serve as an excisional biopsy to be followed by further treatment if the lesion was confirmed to be an advanced cancer. This could also be a curative procedure if the final pathology was consistent with an adenoma or a T1 cancer with good prognostic factors.\\nTAMIS using six laparoscopic stapler firings was performed in order to achieve macroscopically negative margins. The final pathology showed a tubulovillous adenoma with no high-grade dysplasia or malignancy with clear microscopic margins. Pathology confirmed the specimen was removed full thickness so a second procedure was spared.\\nThe fourth patient was a 60 year old male who had a rectal lesion identified on colonoscopy after a positive FIT test. The lesion was located at 12 cm from the anal verge posteriorly and was attached to a relatively narrow pedicle. It was a large lesion which extended an additional 7 cm proximally. It was removed in a piecemeal fashion using 19 firings of the ETS Endo-GIA stapler and 3 firings of the Echelon blue powered stapler. Residual mass was left as the team had used multiple cartridges and felt that removing the distally remaining portion increased the chances of entering into the abdominal cavity. The residual mass appeared to be villous adenoma, which was felt would best be removed at an interval colonoscopy. The final pathology confirmed the specimen as villous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. The residual lesion will be removed via colonoscopy two months post-operatively.\\nThe fifth patient was an 81 year old, slim female who presented to hospital with hematochezia. She had a colonoscopy which showed a rectal polyp at 9 cm. Biopsy demonstrated severely dysplastic colonic epithelium suspicious for adenocarcinoma. She had a follow up endoscopic ultrasound which identified no obvious mass lesions or perirectal lymph nodes. CT imaging showed no metastatic disease. Interestingly, a pelvic MRI did not identify the lesion nor any lymph nodes of concern. Intraoperative assessment identified the lesion at 9 cm from the anal verge, in the anterolateral position. It was felt to be mobile intraoperatively and that a stapler would be beneficial to simultaneously remove and close the defect to reduce any chance of entering into the peritoneum. Three shots of the Endo-GIA stapler were fired. Final pathology identified multiple foci of well-differentiated invasive colonic adenocarcinoma within the submucosa: this lesion is pT1N0 SM3. At the follow up appointment management options going forward were discussed: full excision (via low anterior resection), which was recommended given the SM3 status, versus close surveillance. The patient wished to pursue close surveillance given her age and comorbidities. As is our standard she will undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy at 3months and a colonoscopy at 1 year post-operatively. She will have a repeat MRI in 6 months time and if any findings, another repeat scope at that time. Her CEA levels will be repeated every 6 months.',\n",

Inspection of the pattern deviation plot confirmed the presence of an inferior visual field defect with an apparent greater impairment on the left side. Record review confirmed that the bilateral, inferior visual field loss was non-progressive and identified as early as age 5; when the patient was first able to participate in formal visual field testing.\\nAll imaging was carried out using a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva system and an eight-channel head coil. Conventional T1 weighted structural images were acquired using an MP-RAGE pulse sequence (TE 3.1 ms, TR 6.8 ms, flip angle 9 degree, 1 x 1x 1.2 mm voxel size). For white matter tract reconstruction, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) was chosen given its superior ability in revealing intravoxel white matter fiber heterogeneity and delineation of multiple fiber orientations within an individual voxel (Tuch et al.,). HARDI images were acquired using a single shot EPI sequence (TE 73 ms, TR 17844 ms, 64 directions, Bmax 3000, Bmin 0, 2 mm isotropic voxel size). White matter fiber tracking and reconstruction were performed using DSI Studio software (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/) with diffusion decomposition and sparse solution of the fiber orientation distribution function (ODF). HARDI images were aligned to the anatomical data using boundary based registration (Greve and Fischl,). The optic radiations were defined using a two-seed approach. For each hemisphere, the thalamus (composed of the thalamus proper and the ventral diencephalon containing the lateral geniculate nucleus; Desikan et al.,) was used as the start seed, while the white matter adjacent to the pericalcarine cortex was used as the second seed. Termination criteria were based on a subject-specific threshold of quantitative anisotropy and an angle change of 75 degree, enabling the capture of the full extent of the optic radiations. Both T1-weighted and HARDI images were acquired in the same scanning session. HARDI images were acquired within a 22 min scan period.\\nStandard T1-weighted MRI imaging of the CVI patient revealed markedly enlarged ventricles characteristic of PVL as compared to the age/gender matched control (Figure 1B). However, no details regarding the structural integrity of the optic radiations could be ascertained by standard MRI alone. By comparison, white matter reconstruction of the optic radiations obtained by HARDI revealed a generalized reduction in geniculo-striate projections in the CVI patient compared to the normal developed control (sagittal view; Figure 1C). Furthermore, the optic radiations along the superior bank qualitatively appeared to be markedly reduced than in the ventral bank, consistent with the inferior visual field deficit characterized on clinical examination. Finally, the marked reduction of optic radiations in the right hemisphere (compared to left) was also consistent with the laterality of the visual deficit suggested by perimetry findings.\\nThe functional organization of occipital visual cortex was characterized using static retinotopic mapping techniques allowing for rapid and robust identification of early visual area borders (Rajimehr and Tootell,; Nasr et al.,). Boundaries between primary (area V1), secondary (area V2), and tertiary (area V3) visual areas were functionally identified in both hemispheres. Flashing high-contrast colored checkboard stimuli (8 Hz) were presented in sub regions of the visual field and two spatially complementary stimuli were contrasted: (1) a horizontal meridian wedge (8.6  radius and 30  angle) vs. a vertical meridian wedge (8.6  radius and 60  angle) to identify early visual area borders and (2) an upper-field wedge (8.6  radius, 15  angle) vs. a lower-field wedge (8.6  radius, 15  angle) to differentiate activation between the upper and lower visual field. Each pair of stimuli (i.e., meridians as well as upper and lower wedges) were presented in two runs of 16, 16-s blocks comprised of six blocks of each stimulus and four blocks of fixation per run. Retinotopy was acquired with a single-shot EPI sequence (TE 28 ms, TR 2000 ms, flip angle 90 degree, 3 mm isotropic resolution with no slice gap). Each run of the scan was 256 s in duration. For all retinotopic runs, the subjects were instructed to maintain fixation on a central 0.9  fixation stimulus throughout the run and respond using a button box when the central target changed its luminance (TR-wise probability of a luminance change = 30%). Fixation performance (detection accuracy and reaction time) was scored after the scanning session. Stimuli were viewed under binocular viewing conditions.\\nAll structural and functional data were analyzed with FreeSurfer and FS-FAST packages (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Using standard FreeSurfer methods (Fischl et al.,; Greve and Fischl,), the surface of each cerebral cortical hemisphere was extracted via image processing based on the anatomical gray-white matter boundary and computationally reconstructed as a 3D mesh of vertices. In order to permit visualization of multiple visual cortical areas, each cortical hemisphere was computationally inflated to reveal buried sulcal regions and an occipital lobe \"flat patch\" was created for each subject hemisphere by making cuts in the vertex mesh (along the calcarine sulcus and the anterior extent of the occipital lobe) and unfurling this mesh into a 2D representation (see Figure 2A for further details). Each functional run was rigidly registered to the anatomical data using gray-white matter boundary based registration (Greve and Fischl,). Functional data was motion corrected and spatially smoothed using a 3D Gaussian kernel (fwhm = 3.0), separately by run and by hemisphere. Voxel-wise statistical tests were based on a univariate general linear model (GLM), and the significance levels (inverse log p-value) were visualized on the inflated and flattened cortical surfaces.\\nDorsal (d) and ventral (v) regions of interest (ROI) were identified in each hemisphere and in each participant using block-design retinotopic fMRI analysis (e.g., Nasr et al.,). Briefly, the V1/V2 border lies along the center of the vertical meridian response, as it runs both dorsally and ventrally, and the center of the horizontal meridian representation in the calcarine sulcus was used to define dorsal and ventral subdivisions in each cerebral hemisphere. Each ROI represents the diametrically opposed region of the visual field (e.g., dorsal V1 of the right hemisphere represents the lower-left quadrant of the visual field). It is important to note that identifying the boundaries between early visual areas permits us to define ROIs for V1 and V2, but leaves the anterior border of V3 undefined. Since the visual cortical areas just anterior to V3d and V3v (V3A and hV4) contain hemifield representations rather than quadrant representations, the quadrant analysis could be seriously contaminated if the anterior borders are not well localized. For this reason, we quantitatively examined the quadrant results only in areas V1 and V2.\\nWe then determined the BOLD percent signal change to the upper visual field wedge (relative to passive fixation) and to the lower visual field wedge, within each ROI for each subject for each run. Since the dorsal parts of V1 and V2 are responsive to lower visual field stimulation and ventral parts are responsive to the upper visual field stimulation, this allowed us to create an in-field vs. out-of-field metric for each ROI and for each subject, normalized by the standard deviations of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals. This in vs. out metric was computed as follows: \\nWhere \"preferred\" is the BOLD percent signal change evoked by the preferred stimulus for each ROI (i.e., the upper visual field wedge in ventral areas and the lower field wedge in dorsal areas) and \"nonpreferred\" is the BOLD percent signal change evoked in the ROI by the other, nonpreferred wedge. Standard deviations in BOLD percent signal change were computed within subjects and across runs. The in vs. out metric was contrasted between the CVI and control subject for each visual quadrant ROI as a ratio. A ratio of 100 indicates that the CVI patient and the control demonstrate similar responsivity profiles, while a ratio less than 100 indicates that the representation of the upper/lower visual field is less strongly segregated in the CVI patient than in the control subject.\\nBoth the CVI patient and the control subject were able to maintain adequate central fixation during the fMRI scans allowing for the identification of retinotopically specific cortical activation patterns (CVI patient fixation accuracy: 80%, mean reaction time 640 ms; control subject fixation accuracy: 58%, mean reaction time 729 ms). Functional MRI assessments resulting from the stimulation of horizontal and vertical visual field meridians were used to reveal the boundaries between visual cortical areas and the boundaries of early visual areas (i.e., V1-V3, see Figure 2A). These areas were robustly identified in each hemisphere in both the CVI and control participants suggesting that the overall organization of early visual areas is largely intact in the CVI patient despite the maldevelopment of geniculo-striate projections (compare upper and lower panels of Figure 2B). However, the upper and lower visual field responses showed the most marked difference in the CVI patient mirroring the visual field deficit identified by automated perimetry (described above). Specifically, activation within primary visual cortical representations of the lower visual field (V1d) in the right and left hemisphere of the CVI patient exhibited respectively only 21.5 and 22.2% of the activation observed in the same lower visual field representations in the control participant (Figure 2C). In contrast to those strongly attenuated for the lower visual field, cortical representations of the upper visual field (V1v) exhibited minimal differences in activation between participants (right hemisphere: 91.9% activation of control, left hemisphere: 89.1% activation of control). Again, this pattern is consistent with the inferior visual field deficit characterized by perimetry and the observed reduction in optic radiation tracts along the dorsal branch corresponding to the inferior visual field representation. Finally, in terms of laterality, a greater reduction in activation in the right lower visual field (V1d) compared to the left lover field (V1d) was also observed. This is further consistent with the lateralized visual field deficit in the left side as well as marked reduction in optic radiations observed in the right hemisphere. For comparison, we also examined regional activations in V2 and found a similar pattern to that of V1. Specifically, dorsal areas (lower field representations) exhibited much lower activations in the CVI subject as compared to control (right hemisphere: 33.1% activation of control, left hemisphere: 35.3% activation of control), while the ventral (upper field representations) were similar between CVI and control subjects (right hemisphere: 147.4% activation of control, left hemisphere: 93.7% activation of control). We further noted that the activation ratios between the CVI and control subjects were somewhat smaller in V1 than in V2 (approximately 22% compared to 34%, respectively). This result is consistent with the fact that V2 neurons have larger receptive fields than V1 neurons and thus V2d receives more upper field visual stimulation than does V1d (Zeki,; Smith et al.,).',\n",

Though the symptoms started on the first day after the operation, they were not severe and he was discharged from the hospital three days postoperatively. There were associated vomiting, anorexia and hiccoughs, which all started on the fifth day after surgery. The urethral catheter was removed on the third postoperative day and he experienced a significant improvement in his urinary symptoms. He had no known history of hypertension or diabetes patient and there was no previous history of intra-abdominal operations\\nClinical examination at presentation revealed mild pallor, fever (T-37.8 C), and bilateral peri-orbital and pedal swellings. The pulses were normal but blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg. The abdomen was distended but soft with no areas of tenderness. Percussion notes were tympanitic and the bowel sounds were hyperactive. Digital rectal examination revealed an enlarged nodular prostate and the rectum contained soft brownish stool. The absent testes and the healing scrotal wound were noted. There was no neuromuscular abnormality.\\nHis hemoglobin was 11.2 g/dL; the white cell count was 10.8 x 109/L, (neutrophilia of 73%) and platelet count of 258 x 109/L. He had evidence of renal impairment: serum urea was 28.2 mMol/L (normal range: 2.5-6.5 mMol/L) and serum creatinine level was 744 mumol/L (53-106 muMol/l). He was hyponatraemic (Sodium 126 mMol/L) (135-145 mMol/L) and slightly hyperkalaemic (Potassium, 5.1 mMol/L) (2.9-5.0 mMol/L), Urinary specific gravity was normal. Abdominal radiographs revealed features of intestinal obstruction, with gaseous distension of the bowel especially of the small bowel with multiple air fluid levels and paucity of gas in the pelvis (see Figures 1 and 2). Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound scanning revealed bilateral moderate hydronephrosis, a thickened urinary bladder wall with irregularity in its lower segment and remnants of the prostate gland. Urine microbiology culture yielded growth of klebsiella pneumoniae, which was sensitive to ceftazidime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination.\\nIt was apparent that the patient had intestinal obstruction occurring after the Channel TURP with obstructive nephropathy. Initially, conservative management was instituted vis a vis nothing by mouth, intravenous fluids (normal saline alternating with 5% dextrose-saline), and intravenous antibiotics using a combination of ceftazidime and metronidazole. The gastro-intestinal tract was decompressed by passing a naso-gastric tube for continuous drainage. A size 18 Fr Foley urethral catheter was passed to monitor the patient's urine output and to decompress the upper urinary tract.\\nThe patient's renal function improved significantly with the conservative management but the abdominal pain and distension persisted and got worse. On the tenth day of admission, he had an exploratory laparotomy. Findings at laparotomy were distended small bowel loops and multiple adhesions involving the dome of the bladder, the small intestine and the large omentum. Adhesiolysis was done and the intestinal loops were released. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was commenced on graded oral diet on the third postoperative day after which he moved his bowel on the same day. The renal status of the patient continued to improve and urethral catheter was removed on the tenth postoperative day, and the patient voided satisfactorily. The serum electrolyte and urea levels at discharge were all within normal ranges (Sodium, 135 mMol/L; Potassium, 4.4 mMol/L; Urea-4.8 mMol/L and creatinine - 88 muMol/L). The patient was discharged from the hospital on antihypertensive medications 22 days after admission.

Diagnostic phrenic nerve stimulation demonstrated bilateral diaphragm responses, allowing diaphragm pacing. In May 2001, the patient was implanted with intrathoracic phrenic stimulators (Atrostim , Atrotech, Finland). After 4 weeks of diaphragm reconditioning, complete ventilator weaning was obtained, the patient rapidly using diaphragm pacing 24 h a day and then doing so for several years. Decreased pacing efficiency was first noted in 2007, with the need to increase stimulation intensities to maintain tidal volume at the level needed to keep alveolar ventilation adequate (650-700 mL). The situation slowly deteriorated over the following years, with the appearance of dyspnoea in the sitting position, decreased tidal volumes, and partial followed by total loss of ventilatory autonomy leading to nocturnal, and then permanent ventilator dependency in 2012 (tidal volume 200-250 mL). Phrenic nerve function was verified several times, always with normal phrenic nerve conduction times and ample, and symmetrical diaphragm action potentials. A progressive decrease in tracheal pressure and abdominal movements following phrenic stimulation was noted. During this course, device replacement, aggressive correction of malnutrition and aggressive urologic management of chronic urinary tract infection (both liable to be responsible of muscle weakness and/or neuromuscular transmission impairment) were conducted without modifying the course of diaphragm pacing deterioration. In May 2011, high-resolution chest computed tomography revealed widespread vertebral fusion suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis (Fig. 1). This diagnostic had indeed been established prior to the accident having led to quadriplegia (HLA B-27 positive), the patient reporting the occasional use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to control intermittent back pain before he became quadriplegic. It was concluded that the disease had evolved over years, the patient not perceiving pain because of the spinal lesion, and diaphragm pacing failure was attributed to thoracic ankylosis preventing diaphragm contractions to adequately inflate the rib cage. The patient died in May 2012 of severe pneumonia.',\n",

Phrenic stimulation induced-thoracic expansion had become almost undetectable. No device dysfunction was identified. Phrenic nerve conduction was normal, as was tracheal twitch pressure in response to bilateral phrenic stimulation. Over the same time frame, complex hormonal disorders led to massive weight gain (from 67 to 104 kg, body mass index 22.6-35.1 kg/m2), with an ulterior diagnostic of Klinefelter syndrome.

The abdominal ultrasonography was interpreted in favour of AP. In the abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), the gall bladder could not be observed (excised) and the pancreas was diffusely enlarged (Figure 1), while widespread increases of density and fluid retention were observed in the peripancreatic bilateral anterior renal fascia, splenic hilum, mesenteric adipose tissue, and the pelvic region. There was 19 x 18 mm necrosis area in the head of pancreas. Filling defects (thromboses) were observed in the splenic vein at the level of the tail of the pancreas. The patient's CT image shows the AP and splenic vein thrombosis (Figure 2). A central venous catheter was placed and the patient was prescribed blood glucose tests every six hours and insulin treatment for the regulation of her blood glucose levels.

The intraoral examination revealed a mass, 25x35-mm in diameter, located in the buccal and palatal aspect of the edentulous alveolus of the left maxilla, in the area between the second premolar and the first molar (Fig. 1B and C). The mucosal surface of the mass was rough and covered with small and protruding hemorrhagic papules, which were pink-red in color. On palpation, the mucosa surrounding the mass appeared to be normal and was not indurated. However, tenderness and bleeding were identified.\\nA panoramic radiograph revealed a dome-shaped radiopaque mass with well-defined margins extending from the left maxilla to the maxillary sinus. The lesion caused the floor of the antrum to be elevated (Fig. 2). CT revealed a round cystic lesion, 30x40 mm in dimateter, which extended from the left maxillary alveolar region to the maxillary sinus (Fig. 3A and B). The floor of antrum was elevated by the cystic lesion and its margins were thickened (Fig. 3B and C). A section of the elevated sinus floor had been destroyed (Fig. 3C). 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) detected FDG uptake in the left maxilla [maximum standardized uptake value, (SUVmax), 12.4; Fig. 4A] and in two submandibular lymph nodes (SUVmax, 2.2). No abnormal FDG uptake that would have been indicative of another primary tumor or distant metastasis was detected on the FDG-PET images (Fig. 4B).\\nFrom these imaging results, the lesion was diagnosed as a primary malignant tumor arising from the left maxilla. The tumor was clinically staged as T4aN2bM0 in accordance with the 2009 Union for International Cancer Control system. An incisional biopsy was performed and indicated that the lesion was a PIOSSC. The patient underwent a subtotal maxillectomy of the left maxilla, and left radical neck dissection under general anesthesia and the diagnosis was histopathologically determined following surgery.\\nThe histopathological examination of the excised specimen revealed tumor cells consisting of atypical squamous epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei, which had invaded the submucosal connective tissue and bone (Fig. 5A-C). The tumor was accompanied by necrosis inside the tumor nests and scattered mitotic figures (Fig. 5D and E). These features indicated a poorly differentiated SCC. Inside the lesion, there was no clear evidence of the presence of cysts. However, the tumor had progressed to the surface from deep within the tissue, no atypical cells were observed in the epithelium at the boundary of the ulcer, and there was no contiguity between the oral mucosal epithelium and the maxillary sinus mucosa. No histological metastasis to the lymph nodes was identified. Based on these findings, the lesion was finally diagnosed as PIOSCC.\",\n",

On initial examination, visual acuity was 0.2 (Snellen equivalent) in the right eye and light perception was in the left eye. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed left hard brown cataract and right pseudophakia. Specular microscopy was within acceptable limits (cell density >2000 cells/mm2, hexagonality >50%) in the left eye. Intraocular pressure measurements were normal bilaterally. Right fundus examination showed macular atrophic changes. However, dense cataract did not allow a detailed fundoscopic evaluation in the left eye. B-scan ocular ultrasonography revealed no retinal detachment or intraocular mass.\\nPhaco surgery was performed under retrobulbar anesthesia due to poor patient compliance. A 2.75 mm superior clear corneal incision was created, and anterior lens capsule was stained with trypan blue dye. Central part of the anterior lens capsule was punctured with a cystotome following OVD injection into the anterior chamber (AC). A continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis was created. Two corneal side port incisions were made using a 20-gauge blade two clock hours away from the superior corneal incision. After hydrodissection, central vertical groove was formed, and nucleus was cracked into two halves (Figures 1(a) and 1(g)). Using the phaco needle, core nucleus (which is the rock-hard part of the lens) of the two halves was hollowed sideward in the capsular bag (using low vacuum (linear increment with an upper limit of 80 mmHg) and power (linear increment with an upper limit of 80% torsional amplitude) settings) (Figures 1(b) and 1(h)). A dispersive OVD was injected into the AC to protect corneal endothelium. The nuclear halves were removed from the capsular bag using the phaco tip, and each half was pushed to one side on the iris plane with assistance of OVD (Figures 1(c) and 1(i)). Capsular bag was inflated with OVD, and a foldable IOL was implanted (Figures 1(d) and 1(j)). Thus, posterior capsule moved backwards and got fully secured.

A 99mSestamibi-CT scan confirmed increased uptake in the topography of left inferior PT, corresponding to CT scan findings. Therefore, the patient was referred for formal cervical exploration with parathyroidectomy. At surgery, the inferior left PT was a polycystic gland of about 5 cm, adherent to the posterior face of left thyroid and close to the esophagus.

       "    'case_text': \"As detailed above, the amino acid sequence of ACE-2 is a determining factor of the host species range affected by SARS-CoV-2. During the search for an animal model of COVID-19, bioinformatic predictions and previous studies with SARS-CoV-1 indicated that non-human primates, ferrets, hamsters, and domestic cats were possible animal candidates to be explored. Accordingly, experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical sign development have been successfully accomplished in non-human primates, ferrets, and golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Experimental infection was also successful in cats, but the animals developed no clinical signs. In dogs, the intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in 3-month-old beagles resulted in only two out of four experimentally infected animals developing neutralizing antibodies and no detectable viral RNA in organ tissues of one euthanized animal 4 days postinfection. Viral RNA was sporadically detected in the feces of these dogs a few days postinfection. This same study shows that experimental infection of SARS-CoV-2 was not successful in pigs, ducks, and chickens. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that companion animals, particularly cats and hamsters, may get infected with SARS-CoV-2 outside experimental laboratory conditions. As previously shown in a review on cell, tissue, and animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection, non-human primates may be used for human clinical tests, while primary cell culture, primary tissue explants, and organoids may be applied for other human and animal approaches.\\nWith millions of people detected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, reports of companion animals possibly infected with the virus started to emerge. These animals were frequently owned by individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising concerns that an anthropozoonotic transmission occurred. Therefore, our aim is to review reported cases of animals naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2, particularly companion pets, shedding light on the role of these animals in the epidemiology of COVID-19.\\nMembers of the Coronaviridae family have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome varying from 26 to 32 kilobases, the largest viral RNA genomes ever described. CoVs are enveloped viruses and identified in several species of birds and mammals, including humans. The Coronaviridae family is composed of two subfamilies (Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae) and four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) found in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. The organization and expression of their genome are very similar, with 15 to 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16, with nsp1 being absent in Gammacoronavirus), codified by ORF1ab at the 5' end, and four to six structural proteins, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE, found in some betacoronaviruses) spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), which are codified by ORFs at the 3' end of the genome.\\nIn humans, CoVs primarily cause infections of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe or lethal. Seven CoV strains are able to infect humans: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E (Alphacoronavirus), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and more recently, SARS-CoV-2 (all these in the Betacoronavirus genus). HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are distributed globally, with seasonal and geographic variations. These are low-pathogenic CoVs associated with a variety of mild upper respiratory tract infections, occasionally affecting the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, bronchiolitis, or both. Nonetheless, in the last two decades, highly pathogenic, zoonotic CoVs emerged. These are SARS-CoV-1, which emerged in China in 2002; MERS-CoV, which was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012; and SARS-CoV-2 identified in China in 2019. These CoVs are highly pathogenic and may cause lethal disease, with variable mortality rates of about 10% for SARS-CoV-1, 34% for MERS-CoV, and from 1 to 7% for SARS-CoV-2. The epidemic of SARS-CoV-1 affected 26 countries, and more than 8,000 cases were reported, while MERS-CoV was identified in 27 countries, with more than 80% of the 2,494 cases reported in Saudi Arabia. Currently, SARS-CoV-1 is not detected in any region of the world, and MERS-CoV cases are sporadically reported in Saudi Arabia. SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, is currently at epidemic peaks in many regions, with exponential growth of case numbers and fatalities globally.\\nCoronaviridae species affecting host species other than humans have been reported, causing respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, or neurological diseases in a variety of domestic and wild animals, with no human infection by these coronaviruses ever reported. Among companion animals, canine coronavirus (CCoV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV) belong to the species Alphacoronavirus 1 with two serotypes (I and II), each occurring as either a low-virulence biotype that causes mild to silent enteric infectious and high-virulence, pantropic biotypes in dogs (a CCoV-IIa lineage) and cats (feline infectious peritonitis virus). In addition, a betacoronavirus named canine respiratory coronavirus has been associated with respiratory disease in dogs.\\nAmong large animals, calves and adult cattle are susceptible to enteric and respiratory disease after infection by bovine coronavirus (a Betacoronavirus), while another betacoronavirus, equine coronavirus, has been associated with enteric disease in horses. Avian coronavirus (a Gammacoronavirus) has chickens as a natural host, infecting the trachea, lungs, kidneys, reproductive tract, and intestines in broilers, layers, and breeders with a wide range of serotypes. Moreover, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), first reported in 2017, together with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are alphacoronaviruses that cause highly lethal enteric disease in pigs. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and the betacoronavirus porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) also use pigs as hosts.\\nTo understand how certain domestic animal species may be infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to investigate the underlying reason for the ability of the virus to enter host cells and establish infection. Current knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis indicates that such event is made possible by the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host ACE-2 protein, which acts as a receptor for viral adherence and membrane fusion. Supplementary Data and Table 1 show a multiple protein sequence alignment of ACE-2 of human, main domestic, and laboratory animal species and cross-species identity of the 22 amino acids of ACE-2 that physically interact with SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Among putative pet animals, golden Syrian hamsters, cats, and rabbits diverge in only 3 of the 22 amino acids of ACE-2 responsible for the interaction with SARS-CoV-2, while dogs diverge in five amino acids (Supplementary Data and Table 1). However, the whole-protein sequence of ACE-2 of golden Syrian hamsters showed higher sequence similarity and phylogenetic relatedness to human ACE-2 than the rabbit and cat ACE-2 (Supplementary Figure 1). Whether at the whole-protein level or at the 22 interaction-defining amino acids, this sequence may be determinant of a successful infection, along with the expression of ACE-2 protein in different tissues and yet to be unraveled alternative receptors of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. The link between structural properties of ACE-2 orthologs to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been already investigated. In this study, non-conservative mutations in several ACE-2 amino acid residues have been associated with interrupted key polar and charged viral spike protein contacts, which may decrease the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection across different animal species. In addition, structural analysis of amino acid residues has suggested that changes in amino acid positions 30 and 83 may affect structural interaction of ACE-2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, differentiating non-susceptible from susceptible species.\",\n",

A 17-year-old male Pomeranian with several comorbidities was asymptomatic and quarantined on February 26, 2020, after its owner was diagnosed with COVID-19. On March 18, an asymptomatic 2.5-year-old male German shepherd dog tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in nasal and oral swabs; the two dogs had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, viral sequences were identical to the virus identified in the respective owner cases, suggesting human-to-animal transmission. On June 1, in the Netherlands, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in an 8-year-old American bulldog with breathing distress, with a COVID-19-positive owner. The animal was euthanized due to clinical worsening. In New York State, Richmond County, USA, two dogs tested positive to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. One dog showed signs of respiratory illness and severe lethargy associated with hemolytic anemia. The other dog was asymptomatic. The owner of the two dogs tested positive for COVID-19. Both dogs are recovering. In May 2020, a 7-year-old male German Shepherd tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, after 6 weeks with breathing distress. On July 11, 2020, the animal died with a diagnosis of lymphoma, which may have been a confounding cause for the respiratory signs.\\nAlso, in Hong Kong, nasal and oral swab and fecal samples from a clinically healthy cat tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. The owner had been hospitalized with COVID-19. Until April 15, 2020, the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department tested 17 cats from guardians positive for COVID-19, and only the cat mentioned above was positive. In mid-March 2020, in Belgium, viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples of vomit and feces of a cat with diarrhea, vomiting, and dyspnea, using RT-qPCR. Despite the animal's guardian being infected with COVID-19, it was not possible to establish the level of identity between the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 present in the cat and human. This cat showed clinical improvement 9 days after the onset of symptoms.\",\n",

One cat is a 5-year-old Devon Rex, from Orange County, and the owner was positive for COVID-19. The clinical signs in the cat appeared after the owner showed COVID-19-compatible symptoms. Another cat in the same household remained asymptomatic but was not tested for the presence of the virus. The second positive 4-year-old cat was from Long Island (Nassau County) with outdoor access. The animal has presented respiratory signs and lethargy and tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative RT-PCR. Three of five households have shown clinical signs related to COVID-19 but were not tested, and the cat is presumed to have been infected by someone at home or by a virus carrier.

       "    'case_text': \"On March 18, a case of a Belgian cat with a breathing problem, vomiting, and diarrhea was reported, with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR in vomit and feces samples. On April 17, a 9-year-old female cat of European breed from France was tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR on a rectal swab. The animal showed clinical signs, such as anorexia, vomiting, and cough, 17 days after its owner has tested positive to COVID-19. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in two serum samples taken 10 days separately. In addition, sequence analysis of cat SARS-CoV-2 has shown that it belongs to the phylogenetic clade A2a, similar to the French human SARS-CoV-2. In June, one cat from Minnesota and another one from Illinois, USA, tested positive for SAR-CoV-2, confirmed by USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories.\\nIt is not surprising that cats develop clinical signs; SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cell by binding to the ACE-2 receptor, and the ACE-2 receptor in cats has high homology with the human receptor, as shown above. The coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic (SARS-CoV-1) in 2003 also uses the ACE-2 receptor to enter cells. Cats are susceptible to experimental infection with the SARS-CoV-1 and also became naturally infected during the SARS epidemic in 2003. Recently, cats were experimentally inoculated intranasally with high doses of SARS-CoV-2. The animals showed no clinical signs, developed neutralizing antibodies, and eliminated viral RNA in the feces. At necropsy, infectious virus was found in the nasal turbinates, soft palate, tonsils, trachea, and lungs. Experimentally infected cats transmitted the disease by air particles to susceptible cats. Moreover, an experimental study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted by virus-inoculated cats to cats with no previous infection, after cohoused contact. After 24 days of inoculation, all the cats showed IgG antibody titers ranging from 5,120 to 20,480. Since no clinical signs were reported in this study, the authors speculate that cats may be a silent intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.\\nExperimental infection with SARS-CoV-2 is also possible in hamsters, ferrets, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), and African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Callithrix jacchus monkeys have been resistant to SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection, when compared with M. fascicularis and M. mulatta. Experimental studies with rhesus macaques have shown mild disease as frequently observed in human cases and suggest that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against reinfection throughout early recovery days.\\nIn hamsters and ferrets, transmission occurred to other susceptible animals by air. To date, there are no reports of natural cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters or ferrets. The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department tested two hamsters from guardians positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both were negative. Under experimental conditions, Syrian hamsters (M. auratus) have been successfully infected by SARS-CoV-2, and transmission between cohoused animals was observed by direct or indirect contact with blood, feces, saliva, and tears.\",\n",

The swab samples were collected and tested after two Malayan tigers, three Siberian tigers, and three African lions showed respiratory signs for a week. On April 17, the OIE confirmed that one of the African lions tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Later on, all these animals and one asymptomatic Siberian tiger tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR of stool samples. The five positive tigers live separately in the same enclosure. The three lions live in an enclosure in another zoo area, and they occasionally interacted. The Bronx Zoo also has one Malayan tiger and two Siberian tigers living in a distant enclosure. These three tigers showed no clinical signs. SARS-CoV-2 was identified and characterized in a Malayan tiger. The seven symptomatic animals have improved and are expected to fully recover. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 characterization has shown distinct viral sources for tigers and lions, with similarities between tiger and zookeeper viruses suggesting human-animal transmission, but no identified viral source was found for the infection in lions.\\nOn April 26, 2020, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature, and Food Quality communicated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in two mink (Neovison vison) farms, after respiratory disease and increased mortality. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in minks on a farm with 13,000 minks. Additional infections were identified on a second farm with 7,500 adult minks. Three minks with gastrointestinal and respiratory signs were euthanized. Samples of manure, air, and dust collected from the vicinity of the farm are being tested for the presence of the virus. Cats from the farms will also be tested. At least one worker tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in both farms. It is not surprising that minks are susceptible because they are from the same family (Mustelidae) as ferrets (Mustela putorius furo), and ferrets can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmit the disease to other ferrets by direct or indirect contact. The infection in minks appears to be a case of human-to-animal infection, once viral sequences of two farms were related to human being sequences, but in separate introductions. In addition, since March 2020, rabbit farms near infected visons have been investigated by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature, and Food Quality due to possible susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.\\nExperimental transmission study has shown that pigs (Sus scrofa) and chickens (Gallus gallus) were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, since none of the animals seroconverted and all samples were negative for viral RNA after intranasal inoculation. On the other hand, fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) have presented virus replication detected by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization (ISH), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) associated with mild rhinitis.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 46-year-old man with HIV and a history of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma presented with left eyelid droop and left-sided facial numbness five days after restarting antiretroviral therapy following a long hiatus. He was diagnosed with HIV 21 years prior and had a nadir CD4 cell count of 107. His CD4 cell count when he restarted his antiretroviral regimen was 159 cells/mm3, viral load 511,000 c/mL. He had been intermittently compliant with antiretroviral therapy in the past and since resumption of therapy. In 2005, he had a recurrence of Kaposi's sarcoma and received five cycles of paclitaxel with clinical remission by 2006. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable at the time and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was read as having no significant abnormalities. His symptoms initially were stable, but in the subsequent two months, they worsened, with hypoesthesia and paresthesia over all three branches of the trigeminal nerve on the left, severe headaches, ataxia, dysarthria, and dysphagia. He also began to experience fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. A repeat MRI revealed enhancing leptomeningeal masses with associated mass effect involving the trigeminal nerve, middle cerebellar peduncle, pons, and upper spinal cord. Review of his prior MRI showed a suggestion of enhancement of the left trigeminal nerve intradurally. \\nA lumbar puncture revealed elevated protein (205 g/dL), slightly depressed glucose (45 g/dL), with 106 leukocytes (32% lymphocytes, 26% monocytes, and 42% unclassified cells), and no erythrocytes. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cytology was notable for atypical appearing cells, which were suspicious for, but not sufficient for a primary diagnosis of malignancy (see Figure 2(a)). CSF flow cytometry demonstrated no clonal B- or T-cell populations, and IGH gene rearrangement was not detected by PCR. CSF PCR for EBV was negative.\\nA bone marrow biopsy was unremarkable and core needle biopsy of a modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node showed no evidence of lymphoproliferative disease. There was no evidence of pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial effusions on computed tomography and ultrasound studies. A positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) was then performed and demonstrated increased uptake at the known cerebellopontine lesion, as well as in the posterior inferior wall and papillary muscle of the left ventricle of the heart (Figure 1). An endomyocardial biopsy of the left ventricle was performed via left heart catheterization. Pathology revealed large atypical discohesive cells infiltrating the myocardium. Immunostains of the atypical lymphoid cells were strongly KSHV+ (Figure 2), MUM1/IRF4+, CD79a rare+, CD20-. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) using a probe for EBER showed no staining. Comparison with the CSF specimens showed that these atypical cells were morphologically similar to the suspicious cells in the CSF (Figure 2(a)).\\nA preliminary diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma was made based on morphologic appearance, and the patient was initiated on treatment with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) along with intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone for the leptomeningeal disease. He was observed on telemetry for one week without cardiac ectopy and was discharged home. One day following discharge, he had syncope and was found to be in ventricular tachycardia with preserved blood pressure, for which he was treated with lidocaine and amiodarone with successful conversion to sinus rhythm. CD20 staining on his pathology returned negative and so treatment with cycle 2 was changed to EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) without rituximab. High-dose systemic methotrexate was included to treat the CNS disease. Six weeks into treatment, restaging PET CT imaging showed no persistent FDG-avid disease of the heart, and MRI showing significant resolution of his intracranial tumor. Spinal fluid examination demonstrated no persistent circulating disease in the CSF. Clinically, his headaches, dysarthria, and dysphagia improved, but he still had numbness of his left face along the V1 and V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve along with an upper motor facial nerve palsy on the left. Some residual gait ataxia was notable on examination.\",\n",

Computed tomography (CT) with three-dimensional reconstruction done showed occipitalization of atlas. Posterior arch of axis and transverse foramen were absent, C3 body was split into halves (butterfly vertebrae), and the posterior elements of C3 were not connected to the bifid body (floating). They were connected to the C4 facet alone. C4-C6 vertebral bodies were fused. C1-C2 joints were oblique [Figure 1]. CT angiography revealed anomalous course of vertebral artery. VAs were skirting along lateral surface of C2 body and turned posteromedially just short of superior facets of C2.\\nThe patient was put on Crutchfield's tong traction starting with 7%-8% of body weight increased over a period of 24 h. Lateral cervical radiographs showed distraction with partial reduction. The patient was operated through midline posterior incision. Inferior surface of C1 arch traced and dissected to identify C1-C2 joints. Bilateral C2 root ganglia were transected to obtain a panoramic view of the C1-C2 joints. The anomalous VA was addressed appropriately, by dissecting and safeguarding it. C1-C2 joints were opened and drilled comprehensively to make them flat in sagittal and coronal plane. Spacers were inserted with bony chips taken from rib graft. C1 screws were inserted into lateral masses and C2 screws were directly inserted into C2 body just below C2 facets. Further manipulation of C1-C2 joints were manipulated using rod holder and loosely fastened rod to realign facets. The arteries were protected while drilling the C1-C2 joints and inserting the screws.\\nPostoperatively, the patient improved neurologically with immediate relief from spasticity.

In order to analyze the common mutations within the exon 9 of the CALR gene (type 1 and type 2 mutations), which account for almost 90% of all CALR mutations, we developed a simplex PCR assay. We analyzed the sequence of CALR gene and developed primers encompassing the two common mutations, using the online program Primer3 v.0.4.0.

The patient had just recently moved back to Tennessee to seek help from his family in quitting alcohol, after living in Texas and working as a bank teller for 7 years. No known travel outside of the country and no known contact with persons with communicable diseases. On physical exam he was well developed, well nourished, profoundly encephalopathic and diaphoretic. Temperature was 103 F, heart rate 87 beats/min, blood pressure 154/84 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 /min, and oxygen saturation 99% RA. His cardiovascular, pulmonary, and abdominal exams where unremarkable, skin was notable for significant diaphoresis without rash. He was unable to follow commands for a full neurologic exam but was confused and combative, moved all extremities spontaneously and with equal strength, and did exhibit significant photophobia or nuchal rigidity.\\nInitial laboratory data revealed leukocytosis of 11.7 th/mm3 with 92% neutrophils otherwise hemoglobin, hematocrit, and complete metabolic panel where within normal limits. Cerebral spinal fluid evaluation revealed WBC count of 302/mm3 with 98% lymphocytes, glucose 14 mg/dl, protein 144 mg/dl, and was clear in character. Chest x-ray and non-contrast CT of head where without significant pathology. After blood cultures had been obtained and initial CSF studies sent, the patient was place in the neurologic intensive care unit and started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Over the next twelve hours the patient was closely monitored and supportive care was continued as initial results began to return. Gram staining of CSF and blood was negative for bacteria and HIV, RPR, Cryptococcal antigen, HSV PCR where negative. The patient showed minimal mental status improvement within the first 24 hours and an MRI of the brain and Neurologic consult where obtained. MRI with and without contrast revealed right basilar meningeal enhancement with an acute right basil ganglia infarction (Figures 1,2). Given the characteristic finding of the CSF and MRI a PPD was placed and Infectious disease was consulted. PPD was read as negative at 48 hours by nursing staff and re-read as positive at 72 hours by an infectious disease physician. Initial direct smears of two separate samples of CSF where negative for acid fast bacilli, and PCR of the CSF was negative for TB on two different occasions. CT of the chest was obtained to look for possible source of infection and revealed right upper lobe nodules with central cavitations (Figures 3,4). Biopsy of the lung was performed and pathology revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with acid fast bacilli (Figures 5,6). Initial concentrated direct smears for acid fast bacilli from the lung biopsy where negative, but Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated and identified by DNA probe with High Performance Liquid Chromatography at 32 days.\\nTreatment should be initiated on the basis of strong clinical suspicion. As mentioned previously it may take several repeated studies before obtaining positive proof of tuberculous infection and delay in treatment often leads to irreversible deficits or death. Recommended treatment is for 9-12 months and is divided into two phases. The intensive phase is four drug therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamine (PZA), and either ethambutol (EMB) or streptomycin (STM) for two months followed by a continuation phase of INH and RIF for 7-10 months depending on clinical response and sensitivity of the specimen.\\nOnce empiric TB coverage was started the patient showed significant clinical response with improvement of his mental status, but at the time of discharge still had prominent personality, memory, and functional impairment.',\n",

She was evaluated in another centre with a CT thorax and VATS biopsy 3 months into illness. This showed fibrosing interstitial pneumonia (the slides reviewed in our centre was reported as organizing pneumonia). Post biopsy, she developed a left sided loculated pneumothorax, and this remained even after intercostal drainage. She was treated with oral corticosteroids. After a brief period of stability, her symptoms continued to progress. Azathioprine was added on for another 3 months with no response and hence stopped. She was then briefly initiated on Pirfenidone, which was stopped due to intolerance. When she presented to us, she was only on oral steroids. In the mean time, she developed a spontaneous pneumothorax on right side which completely resolved with intercostal tube drainage. There was no history suggestive of a connective tissue disorder. Her co-morbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and primary infertility. On examination, she was not clubbed. She had reduced air entry in the left infraclavicular region and bilateral diffuse crackles and squeaks. Her room air saturation was 95% but she quickly desaturated to 82% on exertion. Her ABG revealed chronic type 2 respiratory failure with hypoxia. Her CT scan (Fig. 1) revealed loculated pneumothorax in left upper zone, pleural and subpleural parenchymal fibrosis with upper lobe predominance. The fibrotic changes have significantly worsened compare to previous CT picture.\\nThe differentials considered were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Absence of response to steroids and absence of triggering factors dissuaded a diganosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. She was started on the maximum tolerable dose of Pirfenidone(400 mg thrice a day) and the oral steroids were gradually tapered. She underwent pulmonary rehabilitation. She was also initiated on nocturnal Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV) at IPAP (Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure) of 15 cm of H2O and EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure) of 6 cm of H2O and long term oxygen therapy was initiated at 1 L/min. She re-presented with increasing shortness of breath, cough with purulent expectoration and pleuritic right sided chest pain. A CTPA was done to rule out a pulmonary embolism and revealed new areas of bilateral ground glass opacities. She was initiated on intravenous antibiotics. After an improvement for few days, she deteriorated with reduced sensorium secondary to worsening type 2 respiratory failure. Her supports on the NIV were increased. She succumbed to her illness in the next couple of days.\\nAn autopsy was performed. The pleura appeared fibrotic and adherent to the underlying lungs. The right and left lungs were contracted and weighed 250 g and 335 g, respectively. Serial sectioning revealed areas of consolidation and fibrosis. On histopathological examination (Fig. 2), there was marked pleural fibrosis and elastosis with involvement of the underlying lung parenchyma. There was interstitial fibrosis and elastosis with some of the alveoli displaying type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia. Overall, the features were in keeping with pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. As there were no precipitating factors, we concluded her to have had Idiopathic Pleuroparenchymal Fibroelastosis (IPPFE).\\nThe various differentials considered were discussed with the patient and her husband. A few uncoventional treatments were given with good intentions (Pirfenidone for possible idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and NIV for type 2 respiratory failure in the presence of a loculated pneumothorax), and these were discussed with the family prior to initiation.',\n",

An arterial duplex ultrasound and CT Angiogram (Fig. 1) found that the anterior tibial artery (ATA), which was the target angiosome vessel, was occluded. Segments of the plantar artery were also occluded. The angiographic images of the distal posterior tibial artery (PTA) (Fig. 2) were suggestive of underlying Buerger\\'s disease.\\nThe patient underwent a tibial angioplasty. An attempt to reopen the ATA antegradely resulted in the guidewire traversing subintimally in the mid ATA and was unable to re-enter the true lumen distally. Retrograde attempt with fluoroscopy was technically difficult as the visible target dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) was too small. An ultrasound guided approach could not find a sufficient patent lumen. In view of poor imaging quality from both techniques but with a potential target distal DPA, a decision was made for an open approach.\\nAs the patient had preoperatively undergone a popliteal nerve block, the skin overlying the DPA was cut longitudinally for 3 cm (Fig. 2b). The artery was identified but not dissected out and looped as traditionally performed. The surrounding tissue around the vessel provides a stable platform for direct puncture. Using the transpedal/micropuncture 4 Fr needle kit (Angiodynamics Inc., NY) the DPA was punctured and back bleeding was obtained. A V18 (0.018\") (Boston Scientific, MA, USA) wire (Fig. 2c) was used to traverse the occluded point of the distal ATA supported with a 2.6 Fr angled CXI (Cook, Bloomington, USA) catheter. The wire was retrieved via an antegradely passed Berenstein 2 catheter (Angiodynamics Inc., NY) at the proximal ATA (transluminally). Subsequently an antegradely passed CXI catheter was passed just proximal to the puncture point of the DPA and the V18 wire was retrieved. The puncture point was closed with a 7/0 prolene stitch. A PT2 0.014\" (Boston Scientific, MA, USA) wire was passed antegradely and passed beyond the puncture point and into the tarsal branch of the DPA. A 0.014\" 2 mm x 80 mm Nanocross (EV3, Covidien, Plymouth, USA) balloon angioplasty was performed across the puncture followed by 0.014\" 2.5/3.0 mm tapered balloon (EV3, Covidien, Plymouth, USA) to the ATA (Fig. 3). Check angiogram revealed good run off to the DPA and the metatarsal artery and a palpable DPA was present. He underwent a third toe ray amputation with good bleeding from the raw edges of the wound. Patient was subsequently placed on double antiplatelet therapy, a statin and was advised to stop smoking. During his routine follow up in the clinic (8 weeks post angioplasty) the wound had healed and he still had a palpable DPA.',\n",

Vein mapping showed no suitable conduit for bypass.\\nAn antegrade angioplasty of the ATA was attempted with multiple wires and supporting catheters and balloons, which proved unsuccessful. The vessel wall was moderately calcified and an attempt at retrograde percutaneous technique using an ultrasound also failed. As the patient was already under regional anaesthesia (popliteal nerve block), DPA was exposed by surgical cutdown and directly punctured with a 4F micropuncture set (Angiodynamics Inc., NY). A 2.6 Fr angled CXI (Cook, Bloomington, USA) crossing catheter over a V18 (Boston Scientific, USA) wire was used to guide the wire transluminally towards the proximal ATA, where it was snared with 4 Fr Berenstein 2 (Angiodynamics Inc., NY) catheter. The angled 2.6 Fr CXI (Cook, Bloomington USA) catheter was then inserted antegrade up to the retrograde puncture point at which point the v18 wire was exchanged with an antegrade PT2 (0.014\" Boston Scientific) guidewire to traverse into the DPA. The puncture point was closed with 7/0 prolene stitch (Ethicon, USA). Post dilatation with a 0.014\" balloon angioplasty showed significant recoil (>50%) at the DPA. A Maris deep (Medtronic MN, USA) nitinol self-expanding stent 3 mm x 80 mm was deployed across the ATA to proximal DPA. However the distal DPA still showed significant stenosis with poor outflow therefore a 3mm x 28 mm Xience Prime (Abbott, Santa Clara, USA) drug eluting stent was deployed across the distal DPA (covering the puncture point). Subsequent angiogram showed rapid outflow to the digital vessels (Fig. 5). The third, fourth and fifth toes were amputated, which showed brisk back-bleeding.\\nOne month post intervention the wound showed poor healing and a surveillance duplex scan showed the ATA and DPA stents were thrombosed. Patient underwent a successful antegrade passage of guidewire across the blocked stent and into the metatarsal artery. On angiogram it was discovered the proximal ATA stenosis was the cause of early occlusion and this was treated with a proximal stent. The wound had healed completely at two months follow-up.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"Growing up, father and son had relatively little to do with one another. Nine siblings were formidable competition, and the eldest - a girl - was already twenty years old when Heisaku came along, by which time fatherhood for Takataro may have lost much of its charm. To make matters worse, under Japan's ie (household) system, the first son mattered by far the most in terms of family name and inheritance. Heisaku's existence was, at least in this social sense, neither here nor there. His eldest brother's name -   : Soei - meant religious glory or honour. Heisaku -    - meant 'normal crop'.\\nOther than Kosawa's early wish to become Prime Minister, which he attributed to the influence of his father's politics, there is little evidence that Takataro attended to or shaped the young boy directly in any meaningful way. Kosawa later recalled Takataro reserving most of his attention instead for the third son of the family, Saburo, who appears to have suffered with behavioural problems. Kosawa resolved to become a psychiatrist one day partly so that he could better understand people like Saburo - how they came to be the way they were, and what might be done about it.\\nTakataro's influence on Kosawa was largely indirect, but formidable nonetheless. He plainly scared his son, who found him overbearing, unpredictable, stubborn and fundamentally selfish (Kosawa, yume bunseki). He recalled his father once complaining to him about the cost of Heisaku's lengthy hospital treatment for a detached retina while in his mid-20s. Despite this being a serious condition, and doubtless a frightening experience, the only fatherly comments that stayed with Kosawa were that one family member shouldn't be allowed (financially) to destroy the rest. Even as Takataro lay dying, there was no let up. Kosawa was by this point a fully qualified medical doctor, pursuing a specialism at one of the country's most prestigious universities. His father simply asked him how long he intended to keep messing around 'at school' (Kosawa, Satogaeri no ki). Kosawa, for his part, tried to bring what he could of his medical know-how to prolonging his father's life. He was unsuccessful, and may even have blamed himself for his father's early death in 1931.\\nTwo things now happened. First, Kosawa started to identify himself with Prince Ajase, who in a famous Buddhist legend set during the lifetime of the historical Buddha imprisons and then kills his father, King Bimbisara. By the summer of 1931, Kosawa had published a mixed psychoanalytic and religious theory of guilt based on this legend, including in it his parable of the smashed plate. Second, Kosawa left Japan in late 1931 to seek out Sigmund Freud. He wrote to his brother Ichiro - the fourth son, who having inherited the family's money agreed to help finance Kosawa's trip - that his aim was to get Freud's approval for his new 'Ajase Complex' idea and then return to lay his completed thesis at their father's grave (Kosawa,).\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"In Kosawa's parable, the child's mother appears by contrast as a saintly figure: capable of great patience and gentleness but also possessing a spiritual gift of sorts, able to see into the depths of the child, meet him there, and nurture a 'truly religious state of mind'. Kosawa's own mother, Kon, was a rather more complex figure, and in any case as was common for a family of the Kosawas' standing, the young Heisaku was mostly looked after as a child not by his mother but by a local girl serving as his nanny. 'Ichi' was around ten years old when she began looking after Heisaku, and as one might expect from someone of that age was not entirely committed to the idea of responsible childcare. Missing her friends, she once tied Heisaku to a tree so that he couldn't wander off while she went out to play. Much later in life, Kosawa's thoughts used to return frequently to that moment - a sign, thought one of his students, that his idealization of the maternal possessed deep roots not in satisfaction but in longing and loss (Takeda,). 1  \\nKosawa was by no means out of the ordinary here. He grew up in a society many of whose men rhapsodized rather than really knew their mothers (Napier,), and who sought to fix the womanly and the maternal as comforting social, emotional and even spiritual categories. She was, nevertheless, a strong presence in his life, ensuring that 'home' offered a reassuring resonance and embrace for Heisaku - powerful enough to surface years later in his free associations. He remembered her joy when he used to return home from boarding at his Higher School in Sendai, in the north of Japan. Mother would make amazake - a sweet rice drink - to welcome him back. She would smile at him as he licked his cup - 'like a baby', he wrote, 'just moving onto solid food'. Heisaku remembered too the vivid sensation of being in the bath with her (Kosawa, yume bunseki).\\nKosawa's early relationships with his father and mother seem to have shaped his attitudes towards both Buddhism and mental health, and to have inspired his interest in seeing the two placed together in a single, salvific system - albeit with Buddhism and psychoanalysis still retaining separate goals and languages and institutions of their own. Helping to set this emerging conversation in train was a Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu (Shin) sect by the name of Chikazumi Jokan. Kosawa met Chikazumi while he was at Higher School in northern Japan, encountering via him a highly devotional, emotional form of Buddhism in which intra-familial relationships were understood as furnishing the individual with transpersonal salvific opportunity. Chikazumi came to this realization while lying in bed one day, critically ill, and hearing his father by his bedside quietly wishing his son's troubles upon himself. It became a moment of conversion: an encounter with compassion so strong and pure that all at once it broke him out of the small, citadel mentality of a young university intellectual, showing him instead a truer, more vital vision of himself - as weak, vulnerable and loved (Iwata,).\\nThe proximate source of this love and compassion was his father. Their ultimate source, for human beings, was the quasi-monotheistic figure of the cosmic Buddha 'Amida' - the Buddha of Infinite Light. The thirteenth-century founder of Shin Buddhism, a man by the name of Shinran, had insisted that the limits of human nature and the boundless compassion of Amida were such that a person needed only to recite a short prayer - Namu-Amida-Butsu: 'Hail to Amida Buddha' - in order to be saved. This wasn't some magical formula. Rather, it was an honest and profoundly generative recognition of weakness, such that the very term 'weakness' lost its typical, negative connotations.\\nThe voice with which I call Amida Buddha\\nIs the voice with which Amida Buddha calls to me.\\nShinran went as far as to say that this prayer could only be truly spoken by Amida Buddha himself, working at the deepest level of a person's subjectivity. As Kai Wariko, a modern Shin poet, put it:For Chikazumi, and soon for Kosawa, the full force of his home life coming into play alongside a new-found devotionalism, modern Japanese family relationships were the means by which Amida's mercy broke into mundane, linear time, and into mundane, human lives (Iwata,).\\nTo twenty-first century ears, much of this must already sound like psychotherapy of a sort (Ross,). But for Kosawa, the connection only really came when he encountered the writings of Sigmund Freud while at university. He found in Freud a modern-day Shinran: someone who understood human frailty, and appeared to be on a quest to tease out and treat them, bringing all the tools of modern science to the task.\\nA few months spent in Vienna, with Freud and his circle, failed to change Kosawa's mind about Freud and the purpose of psychoanalysis, although he did write home to his brother to say that he was a little disappointed with the general level of psychoanalytic practice in Vienna - and was looking forward to getting home to start his own clinic in Tokyo (Harding,). 2  This he accomplished in 1933, seeing hundreds of clients from all walks of life over the next few years - students, farmers, civil servants, company employees, even a sushi chef, a politician, and a Buddhist monk. From his client records, and from the testimony of those still alive who were treated by Kosawa, we get a sense of the therapeutic fruits of Kosawa's inner religion-psy dialogue across his early life.\\n  Kosawa's impeccably neutral consulting room - Buddhist conversation with interested clients would instead be held next door, once the session had ended.\\nPerhaps most revealing are the records of what Kosawa called 'psychoanalysis by mail'. This involved asking clients who couldn't make it for face-to-face sessions in Tokyo to send him, at regular intervals, two documents. The first was a covering letter, addressed to Kosawa. The second was a written record of a period of solo free association - all that had flashed through their heads when they obeyed the standard psychoanalytic command to allow their thoughts and feelings to go where they will. The first document told Kosawa about the client's own self-understanding. The second was the really interesting one: it revealed something of what lurked in the client's unconscious. As therapy went on, Kosawa would hope to see material move from this second document into the first: unconscious elements making their way into conscious awareness.\\nCovering up the ears symbolizes castration, which in turn suggests your desire to become a girl as a means of securing affection from your father. What's more, your recollection and sharing of that memory now may well be a sign of homosexual feelings towards me ...\\nOne client confided in Kosawa that he recalled being embarrassed, as a child, when his parents forced him to wear a girl's rubber swimming cap at the seaside. Kosawa responded that he hadn't been embarrassed at all: he had liked it. \\nPerhaps the client spilled his morning tea as he read this. Maybe he glanced nervously over the top of the letter at his father sitting across the table. Whatever happened, this was part analysis, part carefully calibrated attempt to nudge a client who was beginning to over-intellectualize the process of therapy into precisely the kind of gentle, helpless humiliation that Kosawa believed Shinran and Freud were agreed was central to the success of religious practice and psychotherapy alike. One day, a client of Kosawa's reported to him a vivid experience of being momentarily outside of himself, or at least not quite 'in' himself in the usual way. Kosawa was overjoyed. That, he said, is the real aim of psychoanalysis. Without it, psychoanalysis as a technique can never survive (Harding,).\\nAwareness in the West of the Shin Buddhist sect to which Kosawa belonged has generally been low, despite its considerable size and power in Japan. 3  Buddhism, and especially Japanese Buddhism, has tended to be associated more with Zen. One of the reasons put forward for this is that in Zen, mid-twentieth-century Westerners found a combination they felt Christianity failed any longer to provide: vivid experience, real inner change, minimal theological baggage. Shin Buddhism's emphasis on faith and fundamental human inadequacy, by contrast, was too close for comfort to Protestant, particularly Calvinist Christianity. Why travel thousands of miles to a brand new culture - whether literally or in one's reading - only to find the very thing you were trying to escape?\\nAnd yet for all the past and on-going interest in how Zen and psychoanalysis might work together, pioneered in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Erich Fromm and Japan's famous Buddhist evangelist D.T. Suzuki (Fromm, Suzuki, & De Martino,), Shin Buddhism and psychotherapy - as Kosawa's experience shows - possess promising commonalities. So it is all the more interesting to see that just five years after Fromm and Suzuki's work was published, Protestant Christianity and psychotherapy were entering into dialogue via a radio and television studio conversation between the German-American theologian Paul Tillich and Carl Rogers - the latter once having spent time in training for the Christian ministry.\\n Carl Rogers in conversation with Paul Tillich, filmed for television in 1965.\\nWe may identify four key themes arising in and from Kosawa's inner religion-psy dialogue and the more literal 'dialogue' between Tillich and Rogers: a concern with the damaging social and psychological impact of modernity; a conviction that a profound experience of acceptance lies at the heart of the remedy; a sense that, almost by definition, this cannot be effected by the individual acting alone for his or her own benefit; and a danger - pointed out by critics - that such a remedy, especially where it takes hybrid religion-psy form, risks fostering subjectivities more suited to the totalitarian societies of the recent past in Europe and Japan than their postwar counterparts. It is worth briefly addressing each of these themes in turn.\\nKosawa Heisaku was a great critic both of what he saw as pathological individualism in early 1930s Japan and the false community and comfort offered by Marxism and by Japan's 'new religions', the latter striking Kosawa as shallow and manipulative. Kosawa was hardly alone in these concerns: commentators from the novelist Natsume Soseki through to journalists and philosophers like Watsuji Tetsuro worried about Japan's social and cultural fabric coming apart under the pressure of successive waves of Western fads and fashions from the late nineteenth century onwards. In the United States, both Paul Tillich and Carl Rogers worried, as Terry Cooper has shown (Cooper,), in similar ways. Tillich wrote about 'estrangement': from the ground of our being (a phrase Tillich used frequently for what other theologians called God), from others, and from ourselves. Rogers coined the term 'incongruence': the result of steadily concealing parts of ourselves from others as we grow up, in the hope of making ourselves more acceptable, the end-point of which is the partial concealment of ourselves from ourselves (Cooper,, pp. 17-21).\\nIn all three schemes - Kosawa, Tillich, Rogers - we find that acceptance plays a crucial role in countering all this. Not 'acceptance' in the everyday sense for which 'tolerance' may be the more accurate term, but rather the kind of acceptance that relies on deep knowledge of the person who is being accepted, along with that person's willingness and ability to, as it were, accept the acceptance. One of the reasons why Kosawa chose a little boy, as opposed to an adult, for his parable may be that a little boy, or girl, might still be at the stage where they have not lost their natural ability to accept acceptance. What Rogers called 'conditions of worth', all too clearly communicated in the father's outburst in the parable, have not yet become completely entrenched.\\nBut here is an important point of complication: where does this acceptance come from? For Rogers, the human realm is the source. For Tillich, the human realm - including family and therapist - mediates an acceptance that comes from somewhere well beyond us. Though there are obvious perils in seeking to compare Kosawa's with Tillich's cosmologies, the two share something important in common here. They are convinced that anxiety or other forms of distress stem, in part at least, from our very nature, which in turn is a 'given' of existence rather than something we are capable of shaping. Because of this there is always need of what Tillich called grace and what Kosawa understood as the working of Amida's compassion: some salvific force from without, operating in and through the human.\\nThis places important limits on religion-psy dialogue, in at least two ways. First, though in entirely secular counselling settings one could talk of moments of 'grace' (where something powerful and unintended arises), and on that basis much fruitful conversation can happen between the religion and psy spheres, Tillich's and Kosawa's cosmologies nevertheless understand the human as something else, or more. So for all their usefulness as bridging concepts between the religious and the psy, ideas like 'grace' should not have distinct meanings folded into them as though such things do not matter. Second, in Kosawa's and Tillich's cosmologies human limitations extend to our ability to formulate any adequate concepts - suggesting an even more fundamental hermeneutic problem for religion-psy dialogue (Hirota,). 4  \\nCritics of particular instances of religion-psy dialogue have been quick to offer related cautions. We need some way of distinguishing in meditation, argues one, between psychological insights (about us, in the past and present) and spiritual insights (relating to the 'divine', for wont of a more appropriately inter-religious term, and our place in it, or relationship with it). We need to avoid religion-psy 'dialogue' devolving into the former simply serving the latter - as a provider of high-sounding, inspirational alternative terminologies for what is basically psychology, effectively masking a slide into agnosticism. 5  Still others wonder how forms of Buddhism and Christianity that resist the idea of ultimate reality having a personal dimension can meaningfully talk about 'acceptance'. Surely acceptance is a process with a person at either end (Cooper,; Harding,).\\nLastly, there is a concern about what kinds of people some forms of religion-psy dialogue helps to create. Kosawa, in his own day, was accused of literally 'drinking' his clients: thriving on their tales of distress and even playing the saviour to some extent - unable, despite his theorizing to the contrary, to imagine himself rather than Amida Buddha as the source of a person's felt acceptance. An American critic, though not especially well informed about Japan, offered the provocative criticism that whereas psychoanalysis in the United States sought to free the individual from the fetters of society, people like Kosawa actively sought to tighten them. If one stands back and seeks to read, at a purely social level, Kosawa's therapy, then reliant as it was on encouraging an individual to really experience their frailty, inadequacy, and deep need of others it might indeed fit such concerns. Read, however, at a religious or philosophical level, there might seem to have rather more going on: on this reading, everyone is heir to the very same constitutional weaknesses, so there can - or at least should - be no tyranny of 'strong' over 'weak'. In practice, of course, there was the serious risk of a religious reading glossing, even enabling, the harmful effects described in a social reading. Kosawa was criticized on precisely these grounds by some of his young psychoanalytic trainees.\\nFor Kosawa Heisaku, the fruits of religion-psy dialogue emerged in two simple questions: what is insight, and what does it cost? Good questions, which seem likely to remain with us for some time yet. And there is much to welcome, from this point of view, in the increasing interaction between the religion and psy professions, institutions, ideas and practices - even orientations within individuals. Finding ways to hold such interaction to account, by understanding its sources, claims, motivations and possible implications, is an important task, in which a range of academic and non-academic specialisms have roles to play. This article has sought to sketch out a social-historical and transcultural approach, as just one of many potential angles on this complex modern and contemporary phenomenon.\",\n",

In March 2012, computed tomography (CT) revealed brain and lung metastases, so the patient began radiation therapy to treat these lesions.\\nIn September 2012, the patient was admitted to our hospital for back pain. Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging detected new multiple hepatic metastases of melanoma. A transcatheter arterial infusion of cisplatin was administered, and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was performed. In October 2012, she began treatment with vemurafenib, based on the finding of a positive BRAF V600E mutation in the resected primary site of the skin, which was analyzed by direct sequencing analysis using DNA from the paraffin-embedded primary cutaneous melanoma. She tolerated the treatment remarkably well, and the size of the multiple hepatic and lung metastases decreased, while the size of the brain metastases did not. In addition, the serum concentration of 5-S-cysteinyldopa (5-S-CD), a biological marker of melanoma progression, was also decreased from 40.1 ng/mL to 5.2 ng/mL.\\nIn December 2012, she suddenly developed severe abdominal pain. Abdominal CT revealed ruptured hepatic metastases accompanied by massive intra-peritoneal hemorrhage. A retrospective and sequential analysis of the CT images suggested that a part of the liver metastases had enlarged rapidly and then ruptured with intratumoral hemorrhage during vemurafenib treatment (Fig. 2).

       "    'case_text': 'A 59-year-old man with a history of chronic ankylosing spondylitis for many years, developed neck pain and left cervico-brachial neuralgia following a road traffic accident sustained one week before. Plain radiographs of cervical spine were initially misinterpreted. On examination, he had severe neck pain on mobilization without any neurological deficits. Delayed cervical computed tomography scan showed ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament, calcification of the intervertebral discs and complete vertebral fusion (so called bamboo spine) with transversal fracture at C5-C6 disc level (so called carrot-stick fracture) causing a luxation of the cervical spine with significant compromise in canal space (A and B). A transcranial spinal traction was performed followed by anterior decompression and stabilization via an anterolateral cervical approach. The outcome was favourable. Transverse fractures of the spine are rare in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and diagnosis should be considered following even minor trauma. These atypical unstable fractures occur because of the loss of flexibility and fragility of the osteoporotic spine. Early diagnosis for possible intervention is important because of the high mortality rate.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'In our three patients:(I) a 31-year-old man, (II) a 67-year-old woman, and (III) a 40-year-old man:the mechanism of injury consisted of an ankle sprain. In patient I, the sprain occurred during a soccer match and in patients II and III it occurred while walking in the sidewalk. They went to the outpatient clinic complaining of lateral pain at the hindfoot for 24, 18, and 16 months, respectively. Previous treatments elsewhere were based only on anti-inflammatory drugs, ice, and rest. On a physical exam, there were pain and swelling over the course of the PT. In patients I and II, there were no clinical signs of ankle instability or varus of the hindfoot. In patient III, a bilateral cavovarus deformity was observed. No restriction of the range of motion of the subtalar joint was observed in any of them. Radiographic images were normal. In all MRI images, there were irreparable tears of the PB tendon and anatomical conditions were noted in patients I and II, such as low-lying muscle belly of the PB tendon and a peroneus quartus tendon, respectively. Initially, we conducted a conservative treatment for six months with physiotherapy, rest, analgesics, and ankle stabilizer to restrict inversion-eversion movements, but it was proved unsuccessful.\\nThe illustrative case (patient II) was presented for the demonstration of the surgical technique (Figures 2-9). The surgery was performed with the patient placed in an oblique lateral decubitus under regional anesthesia with a nonsterile thigh tourniquet on a radiolucent operating table. The STA was harvested through a medial longitudinal incision of 3 cm at the region of the proximal lower leg with the hip externally rotated to provide a frontal view of the knee. The graft was prepared by resection of the muscle belly; then its two stumps were tubularized with a 1-0 Vicryl whip stitch. We kept the STA in its full length to ensure that the entire defect was filled after the resection of the unhealthy PB tendon (Figure 2).\\nA lateral curved incision over the course of the PT was performed along the posterior border of the lateral malleolus, from 3 to 4 cm proximal to the tip of the fibula extending to the fifth metatarsal base (Figure 3). During dissection, care was taken to avoid damage to the sural nerve branches inferior to the lateral malleolus. The peroneal tendon sheath and the superior peroneal retinaculum (SPR) were opened, and PB and peroneal longus (PL) tendons were exposed. Dissection was performed proximally and extended distally to isolate the compromised portion of the tendon (Figure 4). The PB was assessed, and the nonviable portion was resected. The distal stump was debrided and totally removed to prevent local pain due to a bulky suture of the STA to the remaining distal stump, under a thin skin. The STA was sutured to the proximal stump of the native PB tendon using a Pulvertaft suture with a 1-0 Vicryl (Figure 5). The suture was performed 3 cm above the tip of the lateral malleolus to prevent the volume effect of increased pressure within the retromalleolar groove. This distance was based on previous studies which recommend to place peroneal brevis tendon tenodesis to the peroneus longus to avoid pain due to the entrapment of the suture. The distal fixation of the STA was carried out through a bone tunnel at the fifth metatarsal base to provide a bone-to-tendon fixation. Since we kept the full length of the STA, there was an adequate distal stump length remaining to fix it distally (Figure 6). The bone tunnel was drilled with a 3.2 mm drill (Figure 7) perpendicular to the long axis of the fifth metatarsal, from plantar to dorsal. The distal stump was pulled from plantar to dorsal through the tunnel and sutured back to itself with a 1-0 Vicryl (Figure 8). Alternatively, it can be fixed with a biotenodesis screw or an anchor. During the suture, the foot is positioned in neutral inversion/eversion and dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, and the tendon graft was tensioned at 50% of the maximum excursion of the PB muscle belly. The length of the reconstruction was determined at this point. The deep tissues, SPR, and skin were closed in layers. The closure of the SPR was made carefully to prevent PT subluxation. Finally, a sterile dressing and a short leg cast were applied.\\nPatients remain non-weight-bearing for two weeks with the cast. At 2 weeks, sutures are removed and they are placed in a walking boot (WB) with full weight-bearing as tolerated. At this period, physical therapy is initiated focusing in the dorsiflexion/plantarflexion range of motion to prevent adhesions in the tendon graft. Inversion-eversion movements are prohibited to prevent stretching of the healing tendon graft and the subsequent development of an elongated tendon with the loss of strength. Patients are instructed to always maintain the WB except for hygiene purposes and dorsiflexion/plantarflexion exercises. The patient who underwent the calcaneal osteotomy followed the same postoperative protocol as the others. At 8 weeks postoperatively, the WB is removed and the patient is transitioned into an ankle-stabilizing orthosis. A physical therapy program is oriented to start inversion-eversion movements and to progressively restore proprioception and strengthening. The ankle-stabilizing orthosis is used progressively less accordingly to the patient rehabilitation.',\n",

This was interpreted as a head of pancreas mass causing portal vein compression. The patient was asymptomatic; physical and laboratory examinations were all unremarkable.\\nThe patient was lost to follow-up and did not receive any further investigation or treatment. Although still asymptomatic, he re-presented 12 months later for a repeat MDCT, which showed that the mass had increased in size to 4.8 x 5.0 cm. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein was also observed. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, which showed a tumour at the upper border of the pancreas and duodenum compressing the portal vein. A 1-cm lesion in the subcapsular aspect of segment II of the liver was also seen. The presumed pancreatic tumour was deemed unresectable and multiple biopsies were taken. The liver lesion was resected and the histology of both samples showed spindle cell tumour. The patient also underwent a positron emission tomography-CT, which showed the lesion to be hypermetabolic with SUVmax of 7.3. No metastatic disease was identified.\\nThe patient was then referred to the hepatobiliary team in Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong for further assessment. The patient remained asymptomatic clinically with normal laboratory results including liver biochemistry (bilirubin 4 mumol l-1, alkaline phosphatase 54 U l-1, alanine aminotransferase 29 U l-1 and aspartate aminotransferase 23 U l-1). A repeat MDCT 2 months later showed that the lesion had a soft tissue density on non-contrast scans. The mass now measured 5.3 x 5.9 x 6.4 cm, extending from the superior mesenteric vein/splenic vein confluence to the porta hepatis. It exhibited heterogeneous enhancement with feeding vessels seen on the arterial phase, both within and around the mass. On the portal venous phase, numerous collaterals were seen surrounding the mass with a sharp interface between the mass and opacified portion of the main portal vein at the porta hepatis giving the appearance of a \"beak\" (Figure 1). The pancreatic duct was mildly dilated and measures 3 mm. The biliary tree was not dilated. There was splenomegaly measuring 13.5 cm craniocaudally. No gastroesophageal varices or ascites was appreciated. Based on these MDCT and histological findings, a preoperative diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of the main portal vein was made.\\nThe patient underwent Whipple\\'s procedure and portal vein reconstruction using cadaveric graft. Intraoperative findings confirmed the tumour arising from inside the portal vein and confined to the lumen with no macroscopic evidence of disease spread. Histological examination of the tumour showed spindle cells with enlarged, pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Patchy coagulative necrosis was also seen. Mitotic figures were at 8 per 50 high power fields, and atypical mitotic figures were found. There was focal infiltration into adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. Immunohistochemical stains showed the tumour was positive for actin, h-caldesmon and desmin but negative for myogenin, c-kit and S100 protein. The final histological diagnosis was of a primary LMS of the portal vein (Figure 2). The patient made an uneventful recovery and no adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy was given. He was followed up for 4 months in our institute with no complications.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 43-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit in our hospital due to multiple open traumas caused by a traffic accident. The patient had a history of hypertension. At admission, the patient presented a constant body temperature of 36.5 C. Physical examination showed no obvious abnormality in the heart, lungs, or abdomen. He suffered multiple lacerations and fractures of the right acetabulum and inferior ramus of the pubis, accompanied by pelvic extraperitoneal hematoma. On the first day of hospitalization, he underwent surgery for multiple injuries. Based on empirical therapy, cefuroxime (1.5 g, every 8 h) was administrated for infection prevention, and anti-infective therapy with cefoperazone-sulbactam (3 g, every 8 h) and levofloxacin (500 mg, daily) was conducted for common bacteria and traumatic wet lung. On day 2, the patient developed a fever (38.4 C), with an increase of procalcitonin (PCT; 31.47 ng/ml) and lactic acid (8.58 mmol/L) after the operation. The antibiotic treatment was changed to meropenem (1.0 g, every 8 h) plus teicoplanin (0.4 g daily). On day 14, P. aeruginosa was positive in the bacterial culture of wound tissues ( Figure 1A ) and was identified as a multiple-resistant strain with antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST; Kirby-Bauer method), thus amikacin (0.4 g/day) was added to the anti-infective regimen. Despite antimicrobial therapies, a P. aeruginosa-positive blood culture was still identified as bloodstream infection on day 16; the dose of amikacin was therefore adjusted. On day 21, the patient underwent thigh amputation, surgical debridement, and drainage due to recurrent vascular rupture and aggravated cyanosis. Five days later, due to the less effective anti-infective therapy, P. aeruginosa-positive blood culture along with fever still existed; therefore, the patient received moxifloxacin to replace the teicoplanin and amikacin. Despite this management, fevers continued, and infection was still under suspicion. Ceftazidime-avibactam (2.5 g/day) was then administrated to replace the meropenem. The culture was P. aeruginosa negative for the 26th-day blood sample but still positive for wound tissues.\\nDue to the uncontrolled infection, other pathogens were suspected. On day 26, tiny, nonhemolytic, and transparent colonies grew on the Columbia blood agar plate of four blood sample cultures ( Figure 1B ), possibly representing M. hominis. Gram staining of the blood smear showed no bacteria. A subculture of blood and wound tissue samples on mycoplasma medium presents as fried-egg-type colonies after 5 days of incubation ( Figure 1C ). Colonies were then identified to be M. hominis by the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and further confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing (primers: 27F, AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG; 1492R, GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT) and phylogenetic tree analysis ( Figure 2 ; GenBank Accession No. OQ642125 for a strain isolated from a wound tissue sample and OQ642126 for a strain isolated from a blood sample). On day 31, therapy with polymyxin B in a dose of 5 x 105 U/day was initiated instead of ceftazidime-avibactam due to its shortage. In addition to the initial isolates of M hominis, two subsequent cultures obtained in the following week were also positive. The AST with a commercial kit (broth dilution method, Zhongaisheng, Hebei, China) showed that M. hominis was susceptible to doxycycline, minocycline, and josamycin but resistant to azithromycin, clarithromycin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, roxithromycin, sparfloxacin, spectinomycin, and levofloxacin ( Figure 1D ). Based on the results of AST, minocycline (100 mg, twice/day), meropenem plus teicoplanin were started instead of moxifloxacin on the 33rd day of hospitalization. On the 37th hospital day, the hematology data and PCT level returned to normal, and infection was controlled. After starting minocycline-based therapy for 6 days, repeated cultures from the blood were M. hominis negative. Details regarding the diagnosis and treatment are shown in  Figure 3 .',\n",

While in the emergency department, he deteriorated rapidly to a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 requiring intubation. A head computed tomography (CT) revealed a large, bifrontal extra-axial mass of the anterior skull base, measuring 52 mm x 37 mm. The lesion also involved the ethmoid cells and frontal sinuses as well as the right orbit. It was infiltrating the dura. Extended peritumoral brain edema with significant mass effect was also noted [Figure 1]. The patient was emergently transferred to our hospital. On arrival, he had fixed mid-dilated pupils, with minimal flexion movement to pain and intact corneal and gag reflexes. Laboratory tests were within normal limits. He was treated with intravenous push of high- dose dexamethasone (20 mg) and mannitol (70 g) and was immediately transferred to the operating room for a bifrontal decompressive craniectomy and tumor debulking.\\nAt surgery, the tumor was found to be very vascular. On opening the dura, the brain was swollen and of firm consistency with no pulsations. A debulking operation was performed along with bifrontal decompressive craniectomy. An intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor was inserted to the parenchyma. The ICP levels were <25 mmHg on average during the postoperative course, the patient was in Glasgow Come Scale 3, with no brain stem reflexes. Postoperative head CT demonstrated persistent, bilateral, massive edema, the patient's condition remained critical and he passed away 1 week later.\\nHistological examination for hematoxylin and eosin stain showed a tumor comprised small to medium size cells, some of them with clear cytoplasm.

The patient had been treated with isoniazid 300 mg, rifampin 450 mg, and ethambutol 800 mg daily for pulmonary tuberculosis during the past two months. He had no history of exposure to antituberculosis antibiotics before beginning therapy. His compliance to antibiotics was excellent after the treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis and he denied the interruption on these regimens. He reported no constitutional symptoms, history of hyperthyroidism or paralysis.\\nA physical examination indicated that the muscle strength of the lower extremities was 2/5 of normal. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. A chest radiograph revealed reticular opacities on the bilateral upper lung fields, consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. His laboratory data included hemoglobin 13.0 mg/dL, leukocyte count 9900/muL, and platelet count 290,000/muL. His biochemical data for serum and urine on admission are shown in Table 1. Profound hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypouricemia were present. Serum pH, bicarbonate level and anion gap indicated hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap. The urinary anion gap was positive (10.2 mEq/L), suggesting the presence of renal tubular acidosis. Urinalysis showed normoglycemic glucosuria, beta2-microglobulinuria, pH 5.5, 2.5 g/day proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. The fractional excretion of potassium was 29.3% (normal range, 4%-16%); the calculated ratio of the maximal tubular transport of phosphate reabsorption to the glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) was 0.24 mg/dL (normal range, 2.3-4.3 mg/dL); and the fractional excretion of uric acid was 77.4% (normal range, 6%-20%). Generalized hyperaminoaciduria was detected with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. These findings suggest generalized proximal tubular dysfunction with wasting of bicarbonate, glucose, protein, potassium, phosphate, and uric acid.\\nAdditional blood tests were performed to determine other possible causes of the patient's hypokalemia. His plasma renin activity and serum level of aldosterone were 21.6 ng/mL/h and 30.5 ng/dL, respectively. His thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels were within the normal ranges. Serum and urinary protein immunoelectrophoresis showed no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy, and immunological surveys of autoantibodies were negative. The patient's reticulocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes levels were within the normal ranges.\\nAn ultrasonographic examination showed a normal-sized kidney, with slightly increased echogenicity in the bilateral renal parenchyma. A renal biopsy showed extensive mononuclear cell infiltrates, including epithelioid histiocytes and eosinophils, mild interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy (Figure 1A and B). Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli and PCR detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the renal biopsy specimen were negative. Focal granular deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement 3 (C3) were demonstrated in the tubules (Figure 1C and D). The same immunofluorescent positivity was also shown in glomerular mesangium, and electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in the subendothelial and mesangial spaces (Figure 1E and F). These findings were consistent with IgA nephropathy accompanied by focal immune deposits along the tubules. Half the epithelial foot processes were effaced, and there were no pathological findings in the mitochondria.\\nPotassium chloride supplementation was given to treat the patient's hypokalemic paralysis. His muscle strength increased one day after potassium chloride supplementation. We substituted rifampin with levofloxacin, but his other antituberculosis antibiotics remained the same. Supplementation with potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate was continued, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 14. The biochemical markers associated with Fanconi syndrome were significantly resolved, and he experienced no paralytic symptoms after discharge. His proteinuria and microscopic hematuria was also improved, and we discontinued supplementation with potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate at the three-month follow-up.

The patient was free of symptoms, had no neck pain, and is fully active. To assess stability and motion, CT in rotation, flexion-extension radiographs, and MRI were obtained. CT showed normal CCI and BDI, and 44 degrees of C1-C2 rotation (22 degrees dexter, 22 degrees sinister) at follow-up at 3 months. At 11-month follow-up, CT in rotation showed 39 degrees of C1-C2 rotation (21 degrees dexter, 18 degrees sinister). MRI showed good visualization of alar ligaments, assessed as radiologically intact, and the tectorial membrane was at normal position. Flexion-extension radiographs showed no excess C0-C1 movement.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 7-year-old girl was hit by a car as she got off a bus. Apart from AOD she sustained a head concussion, an undisplaced acetabular fracture, and a liver contusion. She was initially a little lethargic, but awake and neurologically intact. CT revealed increase in BDI and CCI, an asymmetrical widening of the neurocentral synostosis of C2, displacement of the tip of the odontoid, and a retroclival hematoma. MRI showed a rupture of the tectorial membrane. A temporary C0-C2 fixation was performed with implant removal after 4 months. A long-term follow-up, including MRI in rotation, was made after 8 years. At this time the patient had no cervical symptoms and had a clinically normal range of cervical motion. An MRI of C1-C2 showed that the alar ligaments and tectorial membrane were normal and rotation MRI of the CCJ showed 30 degrees of motion in C1-C2 segment (9 degrees dexter, 21 degrees sinister), shown in Fig. 4 . \\nSurgical technique : Navigated C0-C2 muscle-preserving fixation. \\nThe main goal is to achieve a temporary rigid fixation from the occiput to the C2-vertebra without major injury of the C2 muscles.\\nThe following six steps are made during the procedure: 1st step: To access the deep muscles of the neck with midline approach. 2nd step: To make space for C0 plates and screws with partial muscle removal. 3rd step: Make space for attachment of navigation reference on C2 spinal process without injury of muscles. 4th step: C2 pedicle screws placement using navigated probe or drill. 5th step: Tunneling of the rods under the muscles. 6th and final step: Attachment of C0 plates.\\n1st step : A midline posterior skin incision is made from the occiput to the C3 spinal process to provide access from the occipital protuberancia all the way to the C3 vertebra. Then, splitting of the nuche ligament is performed from occiput to C3 spinal process. Once the nuche ligament is split, one can easily dissect the connective tissue between nuche and the C2 spinal process without injury of the superficial muscles of the neck. The muscles are then moved laterally as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (online only). \\n2nd step : Access to the occipital protuberancia is made by exposing the midline portion of occiput and approximately 1.5 to 2 cm laterally. This means removal of the insertion of the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle and partial removal of semispinalis capitis muscle. The goal is to make enough space for occipital plates and rods as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 (online only); then, one continues dissection deep toward the C1 arch and the posterior tubercle of atlas to remove the origin of rectus capitis posterior minor muscle approximately 1 cm laterally from midline. Once C1 arch is exposed, one can easily access the space between C1 arch and the C2 spinal process and exposure of the epidural membrane C1-C2 as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 , (online only). \\n3rd step : Attachment of navigation reference to C2 is made by access of the interspinal space of C2-C3 and free cranial margin of C2. A midline dissection of C2-C3 will make space for the navigation reference which is attached to C2 spinal process as shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 (online only). \\n4th step : O-arm scan is now performed with reference on C2 spinal process. Correct entry point of C2 pedicles are now located by using navigation and exposing the bony entry point on C2 with sharp neural dissector. Navigated pedicle probe is helpful due to the small pedicles of pediatric C2 pedicles. Screws are then placed without too much injury of muscle tissue and attachments. The rectus capitis major, obliquus inferior, and the cervicis spinalis muscles are attached to the C2 spinal process, in some cases they can be split without too much injury of the muscle. \\n5th step : Rod placement is made by first making a tunnel under the rectus capitis posterior major muscle and the obliquus capitis inferior muscle. This is done by a sharp neural dissector from the screws in following the lamina of C2 in direction of C1 midline. This needs to be done with care, shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 (online only) by the blue rubber bands. Once rods are measured they can be inserted in craniocaudal direction under the muscles and attached to C2 screws. \\n6th step : Final step is adding the occipital plate to the rods and fixations of plates in midline of the occiput as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 (online only).',\n",

Approximately 1 week prior to presentation, the cat had a suspected altercation with an unidentified animal. The owners cleaned a puncture wound to the neck and applied antibiotic ointment; the cat seemed relatively normal until 3 days prior to presentation.\\nHyporexia prompted a visit to the primary care veterinarian, where there were no abnormalities on examination other than a temperature of 104oF (40oC). Point-of-care retroviral tests were negative, hematocrit was 40% and no parasites were identified on peripheral blood smear examination. The cat was discharged with pradofloxacin but re-presented the following day for complete anorexia and worsened lethargy. Fever was unchanged and mild icterus was now identified. A complete blood count (CBC) demonstrated a hematocrit of 31% with mild neutropenia (2.11 x 103/mul; reference interval [RI] 2.5-12.5 x 103/mul) and platelet aggregates; no parasites were identified. Subcutaneous crystalloid fluids were administered, but the cat was not hospitalized. The following morning, the cat experienced what the owners described as a seizure, prompting the emergency visit to MU-VHC. The cat, which had survived cytauxzoonosis 7 years prior, lived on several wooded acres adjacent to Mark Twain National Forest in Cherryville, MO, USA, and was treated regularly with a combination product containing fipronil, etofenprox and (S)-methoprene (Frontline Tritak; Merial).\\nOn presentation at MU-VHC, the cat's temperature was 104oF (40oC), pulse 180 beats per min, respiratory rate 24 breaths per min and was judged to be 6% dehydrated. There were no obvious wounds. Mucus membranes were pale and mildly icteric. Complete neurologic examination findings were not recorded, but the cat was reported to be dull and lethargic. Abnormalities on plasma chemistry profile included hyperglycemia (179 mg/dl; RI 80-155 mg/dl), hyponatremia (140 mEq/l; RI 148-154 mEq/l), hypochloremia (108 mEq/l; RI 112-123 mEq/l), hypokalemia (3.0 mEq/l; RI 3.1-4.6 mEq/l), hypocalcemia (8.4 mg/dl; RI 8.6-10.4 mg/dl) and hyperbilirubinemia (2.6 mg/dl; RI 0.1-0.2 mg/dl). Abnormalities on CBC included marked thrombocytopenia with few platelet clumps identified (10 x 103/mul; RI 166-466 x 103/mul), neutropenia (1.82 x 103/mul; RI 2.2.7-9.82 x 103/mul) and moderate numbers of intraerythrocytic signet ring-shaped inclusions compatible with C felis (Figure 1). Hematocrit was again 31%.\\nBased on a suspected diagnosis of cytauxzoonosis and the associated costs for treatment, the owners opted against specific therapy and took the cat home. After their cat experienced several additional seizures later that same day, they arranged for an at-home euthanasia. Based on our discussions about the unique nature of repeat cytauxzoonosis, the owners requested that the veterinarian performing euthanasia harvest a small sample of liver and spleen to be shipped in formalin to the MU Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory for confirmation of the suspected diagnosis.\\nOn hematoxylin and eosin stain of prepared tissues, portal tracts were infiltrated by small numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells. Marked lymphoid depletion of the splenic white pulp was noted. Mild extramedullary hematopoiesis was identified in the parenchyma of both the spleen and liver. Although modest in numbers, schizont structures typical of the protozoan C felis were recognized in hepatic arterioles and sinusoids, as well as in splenic sinusoids (Figures 2 and 3). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (from this case and a non-infected cat as a negative control) were sent to North Carolina State University for the molecular detection of C felis. Slides were heated to remove paraffin and total DNA was extracted. Partial C felis cytochrome oxidase C1, 18S rRNA and mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit-4 genes were amplified from the infected cat but not the control (see supplementary material for methodologic detail).\\nIn May of 2012, the same cat had been hospitalized at MU-VHC for treatment of acute cytauxzoonosis. Diagnosis was based on a typical presentation, including acute onset of anorexia and lethargy, high fever, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperglycemia, panhypoproteinemia and multiple electrolyte abnormalities, as well as cytologic identification of numerous typical red blood cell (RBC) piroplasms. Engorged ticks were found on the cat at the time of diagnosis. Treatment included atovaquone and azithromycin, as well as intensive in-hospital supportive care, including multiple blood transfusions, thoracocentesis to relieve pleural effusion, and placement of an esophagostomy tube to facilitate feeding and medication administration. Despite a complicated clinical course, the cat was discharged after 9 days. It recovered completely, and a single CBC performed 2 weeks after hospital discharge failed to identify any parasites.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 54-year old athletic male was a helmeted cyclist on a street race bicycle, when he fell over the handlebars and struck his head directly on cemented ground, sustaining a hyperflexion injury to his neck. He was able to get up at the accident scene and pushed his bicycle to the closest meeting point. Due to severe neck pain, he asked a friend to call an ambulance. He was initially brought to a local hospital in the Rocky Mountain region, where a CT of the head and cervical spine was obtained. The patient was placed in a C-collar and transported by ambulance to our level 1 trauma center for definitive management of his cervical spine fracture. Upon arrival, the patient was awake and alert with a GCS of 15. He stated to have felt some tingling sensation in his right hand after the accident, which apparently subsided by the time of his presentation to our hospital. His clinical exam demonstrated full symmetric motor strength (M5/5) in all four extremities, a normal rectal tone and bulbocavernosus reflex, and minimal hypoesthesia in the small finger on the right hand, related to the C8 dermatome. The review of his CT scan from the outside facility revealed a complex multi-level fracture-dislocation of the cervical spine from C6 to T1, with rotational instability (AO/OTA classification 51-C2.1). The injury pattern included a C7/T1 fracture-dislocation (Fig. 1a) with a left-side locked/perched facet at C6/C7 (Fig. 1b,c), a right side facet fracture-dislocation at C7/T1 (Fig. 1d), and a \"saving\" traumatic laminotomy at C6 and C7 on right side (Fig. 1e,f). A CT-angiogram was obtained which demonstrated a grade 1 intimal tear to the left vertebral artery at the C6 level. In light of the highly unstable fracture pattern, we decided to apply a Halo fixator for temporary external fixation. The Halo application was performed under local anesthesia without any closed reduction attempts, in order to mitigate the risk of an iatrogenic compression of the spinal cord. The patient was kept awake throughout and reported no change in symptoms. Thereafter, an MRI of the cervical spine was obtained for advanced imaging and preoperative planning. The MRI demonstrated a complete disruption of the annulus fibrosus of the C7/T1 intervertebral disc, a disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) and posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) at the same level, and a complete extrusion of the C7/T1 disc into the spinal canal, positioned behind the C7 vertebral body (Fig. 1g,h). The interspinous ligament was disrupted at C6/C7, and there was mild spinal canal stenosis at C6/C7 without signs of cord compression or contusion. \\nThe posterior perched facet requiring posterior approach and open reduction to restore anatomic sagittal alignment of the spine;\\nThe extruded disc at C7/T1 requiring a C7 corpectomy and decompression through an anterior approach;\\nThe sequence of surgery being dictated by the intraspinal disc which requires (1) anterior decompression, followed by (2) posterior fracture reduction, and ultimately (3) an anterior completion fusion after posterior reduction and instrumentation.\\nA surgical plan was designed based on the following considerations: \\nAs part of the preoperative shared decision-making process for surgery, the patient understood the detailed plan and the risks of intra- and postoperative complications. He agreed to proceed with surgery and provided a written informed consent. We took him to the operating room the next day for the 3-stage procedure under continuous neurophysiological monitoring. In supine position, the cervical spine was exposed from C6-T1 through a standard left side anterior Smith-Robinson approach. The dislocation at C7/T1 was visualized and the intervertebral disc at this level was obliterated, as expected from the preoperative MRI findings. A C7 corpectomy was performed which allowed decompression of the spinal canal by removal of the extruded intervertebral disc. The anterior wound was then closed temporarily. Under strict log-roll precautions, using the Halo ring for axial traction, the patient was carefully moved into prone position, for the 2nd stage of the procedure. We then performed a standard posterior approach from C4-T2. A completion laminectomy was performed through the laminar fractures at C6 and C7, for posterior spinal canal decompression. The perched facet at C6/C7 on the left and the facet fracture-dislocation at C7/T1 on the right were anatomically reduced, and a left side C6/C7 facetectomy was performed, which resulted in adequate rotational and sagittal alignment of the cervical spine. Spinal fixation was performed by posterior instrumentation with placement of lateral mass screws at C4, C5, C6, and pedicle screws at T1 and T2. The posterior wound was closed, and the patient was log-rolled back into supine position for the 3rd stage of the procedure. The previous anterior cervical wound was re-opened. The exposed dura was visualized through the preceding C7 corpectomy, and a 2-level anterior fusion from C6-T1 was performed with a PEEK cage filled with autograft bone from the resected C7 vertebra, and placement of a 2-level anterior locking plate (Fig. 2). The anterior wound was then closed, the Halo was removed, and the patient was transitioned into a cervical collar. He tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room. His neurological exam was normal and the hypoesthesia in the right C8 dermatoma resolved postoperatively (Fig. 3). The grade 1 vertebral artery intimal injury was managed conservatively with 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) for three months. The patient was mobilized with physical therapy and discharged home on the 2nd postoperative day. He remained in a cervical collar for 6 weeks and was allowed to remove the collar for showering only during that period of time. The patient resumed full activity at three months. He was back riding his bicycle at 7 months, and by 10 months after surgery he had returned to competitive street bicycle racing in the 100 mile \"Elephant Rock Century Ride\" in Castle Rock, Colorado (Fig. 4). The patient remained asymptomatic and continued his work as a financial consultant as well as unrestricted physical activity and exercises, including regular participation in competitive bicycle races, at follow up 7 years after the accident.',\n",

He has had an appendectomy and back surgery in the past but was never treated surgically for his Crohn's disease. He was on maintenance therapy with Azulfidine and Azathioprine. The patient was started on Infliximab in November 2005 after multiple admissions for small bowel obstruction. The patient was changed to Adalimumab in May 2007 for patient convenience and difficulty related to obtaining regular intravenous access. He denied any recent antibiotic use.\\nComputerized tomography scanning on admission demonstrated a small bowel obstruction with thickened and edematous small bowel in the right lower quadrant 8-10 cm from the ileocecal valve with a small amount of ascites and no evidence of abscess.

On May 7, 2019, he was referred to the clinic of periodontics at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University dental hospital by the nearby dentist due to problems with oral hygiene instructions owing to complaints such as \"gingival damage due to tooth brushing\" and many other complaints (e.g., occlusal instability, difficulty eating, difficulty speaking). At the clinic, he mentioned that his teeth were sensitive to cold water and did not understand the explanation of the lack of identifiable causes requiring treatment. Thereafter, he had repeated unscheduled visits and phone consultations with the clinic to present with complaints such as \"I feel some teeth are missing,\" \"I can no longer chew with the left teeth.\" In July, periodontal scaling was initiated. However, his complaints increased and worsened (e.g., \"gingival recession,\" a tingling sensation and numbness,\" and \"the lower teeth are damaged by the upper teeth\"). He began visiting the clinic approximately once or twice a week. During 3 months after August, he lost 20 kgs due to \"hip pain\" and \"difficulty walking.\" From October, he was unable to work and took leave. The Department of Psychiatry, to which he was recommended by his younger sister, suspected he had somatic symptom disorder after excluding psychotic disorders, depression, and bipolar disorder. However, the psychiatric treatment was discontinued because he remained highly dissatisfied with the dental treatment.\\nOn November 26, 2019, he visited our clinic (Department of Psychosomatic Dentistry) for the first time. However, the examination did not reveal any findings correlated with his complaints (Figure 1). Mr. A was diagnosed with AO, regarding that his pain was limited around his teeth (however, moving beyond nerve distribution), not provoked by jaw movement and failed to respond to every conventional dental treatment. However, based on the previous treatment process and his attitude, underlying developmental disorders were suspected. Hence, effects of amitriptyline and so on were not anticipated. He was referred to the outpatient department of SK, who is familiar with the treatment of developmental disorders in the Department of Anesthesiology, The University of Tokyo Hospital; at this point, the patient declined the referral.\\nHowever, given his continued complaint calls and letters regarding \"incidents at the periodontics clinic\" to the chief of periodontics clinic, our dental hospital director issued a treatment refusal document and send it to the patient in April. In response to our letter, the patient made repeated visits and phone consultations with our department, asking \"What should I do with my teeth?\" Therefore, he was advised to seek treatment at the University of Tokyo Hospital. Despite reluctance, on March 6, he eventually agreed to the referral. He was referred to Dr. SK a psychiatrist at the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Relief Center, on April 24, 2020 (day 0). The timeline for this patient is shown in Figure 2. During the examination, he was suspicious of the treatment in the primary referral hospital and made unsolicited complaints without listening to the advice of Dr. SK. A structured interview, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, was conducted to differentiate comorbid psychiatric disorders. He did not have a major depressive episode with hypochondriac delusions or other melancholy-type features, a manic episode, or psychotic disorder. He displayed gender-atypical gestures and abnormal eye contact and ritualized patterns of verbal or non-verbal behavior (his speech was excessively formal and polite). He was overly particular about Dr. SK\\'s wording and frequently corrected his expressions. He had highly restricted and fixated interests in gingival pain and was hyperreactive to sensory input. Hence, he was diagnosed with ASD according to the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5. He was highly educated and employed in a highly structured, professional occupation, and did not have severe impairment in social functioning due to ASD prior to the onset of AO.\\nBased on hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms observed (fidgeting with hands and squirms in seat, blurting out answers, interrupts others), the long version of the Conners\\' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S) and the observer-rated (CAARS-O) questionnaire were administered to examine the suspected comorbidity of ADHD. Mr A\\'s percentiles of the subscale of the CAARS-S were: E. DSM-IV Inattentive Symptoms, 90; F. DSM-IV Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms, 98; G. DSM-IV ADHD Symptoms Total, 96; H. ADHD Index, 88. According to ADHD symptoms in the CAARS, Mr. A\\'s ADHD symptoms were at the clinical level of psychiatry (Table 1). In addition, according to the CAARS-O completed by his younger sister, the percentile of the subscale D. Problems with Self Concept was 99, indicating low self-esteem related to ADHD symptoms. His developmental and life history was obtained and evaluated with the CAARS using the Diagnostic Interview for Adult ADHD. The results indicated inattention: poor listening to others since childhood; avoiding tasks requiring sustained mental effort, poor logical thinking; easily distracted by ambient noise; forgetful in daily activities. Accordingly, he was diagnosed with ADHD, predominantly inattentive type in the DSM-5 (day 26).\\nDuring each examination, the pain numerical rating scale (NRS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) were administered. Subjective pain intensity was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Regarding the changes in NRS scores, the minimum clinically important difference is called MCID, decreases of-2 points (or-33.0%) or more in NRS is considered to be substantial or optimal. The average pain NRS score of Mr. A was high (7 points).\\nSymptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Based on previous studies, the MCID of HADS is set at 1.5. Mr. A\\'s HADS results revealed clinical anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS-A, 15 points; HADS-D, 12 points).\\nCatastrophic thinking related to pain was evaluated using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). It has been reported that strong catastrophizing thoughts leads to increased pain and disability possibility, resulting in chronic pain. The MCID of PCS can be improved by 38-44%. Mr. A\\'s PCS results (PCS score 30 points) indicated clinically catastrophic thinking. Changes in pain NRS, HADS, and PCS during treatment course are shown in Figure 2.\\nMr. A exhibited strong anger and suspicion at the periodontist who performed scaling. Dr. SK identified the uncontrollable temper outbursts and aggression as ASD irritability and prescribed risperidone (1 mg/day) (day 39). In addition, atomoxetine was initiated at 10 mg to treat severe anxiety and fear due to hyperarousal of ADHD that may contribute to irritability. At the subsequent examination (day 69), the patient responded to medication and stated that \"pain was reduced.\" Temper outbursts and frequent suspicions and complaints of scaling in the primary referral hospital were reduced and Mr A was more polite and considerate. To prevent discontinuation of medication due to side effects, atomoxetine was carefully increased to 20 mg.\\nDuring the examination 2 weeks later (day 83), he was calmer, and his facial expression was less grim, and the amount complaints regarding the symptoms he faced had reduced. Therefore, atomoxetine was increased to 30 mg. During the examination 2 weeks later (day 97) he did not mention anger or suspicion of previous treatments except one mention of oral discomfort. He requested consultation on more practical topics such as the preparation of the document for sickness and injury allowance. Therefore, atomoxetine was increased to 40 mg. During the examination 2 weeks later (day 110), pain and numbness were almost resolved. He stated, \"Lately, I have been very stable mentally.\" Additionally, he wanted to discuss with his boss when he would return to work, so the doctor created a medical certificate permitting him to return to work. Thereafter, atomoxetine was increased by 10 mg at ~2-week intervals, leading to reduced pain and numbness and improved mental health status. He returned to work after the administration of the maximum dose of atomoxetine (120 mg/day) (day 226) with no side effects indicating discontinuation. He stated, \"I am able to set up my work better than before because of the medication I have been taking.\" Re-administration of the CAARS-S at day 324 showed the following percentiles for the subscale of the CAARS-S and improved ADHD symptoms: E. DSM-IV Inattentive Symptoms, 60; F. DSM-IV Hyperactive Impulsive Symptoms, 21; G. DSM-IV ADHD Symptoms Total, 36; and H. ADHD Index, 26 (Table 1). Pain NRS (4 points) improved by 3 points, HADS-A (7 points) improved by 8 points, HADS-D (8 points) improved by 4 points, and PCS (16 points) improved by 14 points (46.7%) from the first visit. Clinically significant improvement was observed exceeding MCID on all scales. Thereafter, he continued to visit the clinic once a month to receive medication. Regardless of the presence of mild pain, he continued his work and achieved social integration. He stated that \"the pain has improved, and I am now able to do my hobby of reading, which I had to interrupt because of the pain.\"',\n",

The diagnosis of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma was made. The dedifferentiated part was consistent with an osteosarcoma.\\nThe patient underwent limb salvage surgery, performed according to standardized local protocol by surgeons specialized in oncologic surgery, followed by endoprosthetic replacement. Wide surgical margins were achieved. Although the patient was reasonably fit, adjuvant chemotherapy was not given due to the patient's age.\\nDuring the further course of treatment, the suspicious condition in the right kidney, that had already been present during initial tumor staging prior to limb salvage surgery, was diagnosed as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (Figure 2) and immediately subjected to nephrectomy.

Moreover, the entire coding (exons 2-11) region and flanking intron regions of TP53 were sequenced. Since both MLPA and sequenciation did not reveal pathologic changes of the TP53 gene, the GAG-banding pattern derived from cell division was analyzed as well. However, chromosomal aberrations were not detected in the cytogenetic analysis neither for structural or numerical reasons. Taking into account all the results obtained, the diagnosis of LFS could not be confirmed, but there is still uncertainty regarding a definitive diagnosis in terms of a possible new genetic syndrome.',\n",

He subsequently developed anterior urethral stricture disease which required multiple endoscopic procedures, including urethral dilations, direct visualization internal urethrotomy, and transurethral resection of urethral stricture and bladder neck contracture. Eventually, he began to void per rectum and was diagnosed with a large recto-urethral fistula. He was referred to a tertiary center and underwent diverting colostomy and ileal conduit. At the time of diversion, the bladder and rectum were left in situ due to a \\'hostile pelvis.\\' After surgery, he developed rectal prolapse and underwent a Thiersch procedure. Unfortunately, the pelvic organ prolapse worsened and he was advised that no further operative options were available. He and his wife began to manage the prolapse of his bladder and rectum by manual reduction, packing the rectum with Kerlix gauze, and applying dressings and tape to his buttock. He sought out further surgical opinions and presented to our center for management of this extremely complex and rare scenario. After meeting with a team of urologic, plastic, and colorectal surgeons, he elected for repair.\\nUsing a transanal approach, the posterior bladder wall was seen adjoined to the anterior rectal wall, consistent with a recto-urethral fistula. The anterior rectal wall was dissected from the posterior bladder wall, preserving all rectal tissue. The posterior bladder was then dissected laterally into the perivesical space. Bladder was mobilized off the peritoneal lining and the posterolateral pedicles were controlled with the LigaSure device. The anterior bladder was then dissected off the pubic symphysis using the transanal approach with slight vertical extension to gain access and exposure of urethra and Foley. Resection of residual prostate with closure of the urethra was performed.\\nAfter cystoprostatectomy, completion proctectomy was judged to be impractical due to the presence of parastomal hernias of the anterior abdominal wall. Bilateral gracilis muscle flaps were harvested from medial thighs and transposed into the pelvic defect. Left gracilis muscle was wrapped around the rectum and sutured to ischium in order to restore some muscular support to the sphincter. The right gracilis myocutaneous flap was used to fill dead space within the pelvis, bridging the gap between the anterior rectal margin and anal verge. Postoperatively, he developed venous congestion of the myocutaneous flap which was treated with medical leaches and eventually necessitated a return to the operating room 7 days post-op. After debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue, the anterior margin of rectum was inset to muscle and anal verge in place of the skin paddle.

Her hospitalization was complicated by unsuccessful coil embolization and subsequent hydrocephalus. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted, and she was transferred to an acute care hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, for further management in February 2013. She underwent reinsertion of the shunt and was discharged to a long-term care facility (LTCF 1). She was readmitted to the same hospital because of fever in March 2013.\\nA urine culture collected at the time of readmission grew carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli. Although production of KPC-type beta-lactamase was initially suspected in K. pneumoniae, the unusually high level of resistance to amikacin (MIC >32 mug/mL) and gentamicin (MIC >8 mug/mL) increased concern for presence of an NDM-1 producer, which is frequently highly resistant to aminoglycosides because of production of 16S rRNA methyltransferase. A modified Hodge test showed a positive result for carbapenemase production, and a metallo-beta-lactamase Etest (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) showed a positive result for metallo-beta-lactamase production.\\nPCR and sequencing identified NDM-1 and OXA-232, a 5-aa variant of OXA-48 recently reported in K. pneumoniae isolates from India. Presence of the gene for 16S rRNA methyltransferase (armA) was also confirmed by PCR and sequencing and accounted for the high-level aminoglycoside resistance. The isolate belonged to sequence type (ST) 14, as determined by multilocus sequence typing, and has been reported to be common among NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae in Europe.\\nThe patient was discharged to LTCF 1 but was readmitted because of recurrent fever. A urine culture collected at this admission grew carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and carbapenem-resistant E. coli. This E. coli isolate belonged to ST95 and was positive for the NDM-1 gene but negative for the OXA-48 group and armA genes. The original extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli isolate belonged to ST3865, which is distinct from ST95. Therefore, it is likely that the patient was already colonized by NDM-1-producing E. coli ST95 at the time of the first admission, but this colonization was not detected in a clinical culture at that time. All K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates remained susceptible to fosfomycin and colistin.\\nThe patient did not receive any antimicrobial drug therapy specific for these isolates because she was deemed to be only colonized with them in the urine. Enhanced contact precautions were also implemented at the time of PCR confirmation of the NDM-1 gene. These precautions included all components of contact precautions (handwashing, gowns, gloves, disinfected/dedicated equipment), and dedicated personnel monitored compliance with these measures around the clock.\\nThe patient was eventually discharged to another long-term care facility (LTCF 2) in April 2013. A point surveillance testing for NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae by using rectal swab specimens was conducted for all inpatients at the acute-care hospital and for all residents of the unit at LTCF 2. Testing did not identify any other patients colonized with NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.\\nIn transformation and conjugation experiments, transformants carrying the OXA-232 gene were obtained from K. pneumoniae, but those carrying the NDM-1 gene could not be obtained by either method, suggesting that the 2 genes were not located on the same plasmid. For E. coli, transformants and transconjugants carrying the NDM-1 gene were obtained, which indicated that this gene was located on a self-conjugative plasmid.\\nDetection of NDM-1- or OXA-48-group-producing Enterobacteriaceae, in particular K. pneumoniae, poses a diagnostic challenge in regions to which KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is endemic. In our case, recognition of resistance to multiple aminoglycosides by an automated instrument, which was confirmed to be high level by the disk diffusion method (i.e., no inhibition zone), prompted early detection and implementation of appropriate infection prevention measures. Production of 16S rRNA methyltransferase by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is extremely rare, and no cases have been identified in the United States. Therefore, we propose that high-level resistance to amikacin and gentamicin can serve as a clue for suspecting potential NDM-1-producing isolates in clinical diagnostic laboratories.\\nConversely, Enterobacteriaceae producing OXA-48-group carbapenemase, including variants such as OXA-232, do not have characteristic susceptibility patterns and may easily not be recognized in areas with a high background prevalence of KPC-producing organisms. Therefore, organisms producing OXA-48 or their variants might have already spread in the United States.\",\n",

Medical history was significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, polycystic kidney disease, and a recent tamponade diagnosed 4 months prior to this hospitalization. Dizziness was his initial complaint in March. A large serosanguinous pericardial effusion was drained at that time with inconclusive fluid analysis including a negative culture and cytology. His medications included amlodipine, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. He used to work as a truck driver. After 45 packs per year smoking history, he quit in 2015. Positive findings on exam were a BP of 85/60 mmHg, mild respiratory distress on room air, increased jugular vein pressure, muffled irregular heart sounds, and pitting edema of the shins. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 59% and a moderate sized posterior pericardial effusion with borderline signs of tamponade. The echo also revealed a fibrinous material and stranding suggestive of adhesions in the collection (Figure 1). Attempt to drain the pericardial effusion with subxiphoid pericardial window was terminated due to fusion of pericardium to the anterior surface of right ventricle. Partial pericardiectomy was then attempted through median sternotomy with frozen section, which revealed a neoplastic process. Hence, a subtotal pericardiectomy was performed. There were adhesions of the pericardium to the right ventricular wall and diaphragmatic surface and nodularity on pericardium. Repeat echocardiogram showed no further effusion. Pericardium and epicardium tissue slides revealed predominantly solid sheets of high-grade epithelioid to spindle cells with focal areas of vasoformation. Tumor cells predominantly epithelioid show prominent atypia with abundant amophilic to eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesicular nucleoli, and prominent nucleoli with atypical mitotic figures. On immunostaining, tumor cells were positive for CD31, CD34, WT1, vimentin, keratins AE1/AE3, and focal CK7 and negative for CK20, PSA, PSAP, AFP, TTF1, CDX2, BerEp4, calretinin, podoplanin D2, CD45, and S100 (Figures 2-2). These findings led to the diagnosis of epithelioid angiosarcoma of the pericardium. Chest computed tomography scan showed nodular opacifications within both lungs with concern for metastasis. His condition stabilized with Lasix and oxygen. He was then referred to the university hospital for a second opinion regarding his management. Cardiac MRI showed extensive vascular malignant mass in the pericardium encircling and infiltrating the right heart chambers. He received paclitaxel weekly for 6 doses with palliative intents. Later he developed malignant pleural effusions and intracranial metastatic lesions. He was admitted again in our hospital for weakness and encephalopathy. Patient preferred comfort care. Hence, he passed away 9 months after his initial presentation.',\n",

Nine years ago, he had been treated with scatter laser photocoagulation for an ischemic type of upper branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in the left eye. At that time, he was diagnosed with homocysteinemia with the homozygous C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene. After a detailed systemic workup, he was put on warfarin sodium. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motions in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. A slit-lamp examination was unremarkable in each eye. The intraocular pressure was 15 mm Hg in both eyes. Dilated fundoscopy revealed tortuous and dilated retinal veins with 360  scattered retinal hemorrhages as well as a clearly demarcated pale retina in the distribution of the upper temporal artery in the right eye and scattered laser spots with macular retinal pigment epithelium changes in the left eye (fig. 1). Our fundus autofluorescent image clearly depicted the extent of the infarcted area (fig. 2a), and fluorescein angiography demonstrated that the peripheral retina was well perfused in the right eye (fig. 2b). Optic coherence tomography (OCT) showed the presence of subretinal fluid and the ganglion cell layer infarct in the right eye (fig. 2c). The diagnosis was simultaneous CRVO and upper BRAO in the right eye. After a prompt digital ocular massage and a 20% mannitol infusion, an anterior chamber paracentesis was immediately performed. However, no visual improvement was noted following the procedure. Two weeks later, a dexamethasone intravitreal implant (Ozurdex, Allergan Inc., Irvine, Calif., USA) was injected into the right vitreous cavity to at least alleviate the CRVO-related concomitant macular edema, as the patient still had a visual acuity of hand motions in the right eye. Visual acuity gradually improved in the following weeks with a remarkable decrease in the central macular thickness, and no postoperative injection-related complication was observed. Six months after the operation, the retinal anatomy appeared to be dramatically improving (fig. 3a, b), and his BCVA was found to be 20/25.

The patient's symptoms began the evening prior. The patient was experiencing chest pain on the left side, which is accompanied by neck pain. The chest pain and dyspnea (shortness of breath) appeared to be worse when the patient was walking upstairs. It is not specified whether the pain is radiating or not. His last fentanyl use was one month prior. At the time of admission, he had been in a rehabilitation facility for one month.\\nHe denied fever, chills, recent weight loss, change in vision, nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, recent sick contacts, or previous episodes of his presenting symptoms.\\nThe physical examination revealed an afebrile patient, with a blood pressure of 131/85 mmHg, tachycardic (110 bpm), and tachypneic (22 breaths/minute), with an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Findings included shortness of breath with lung fields clear to auscultation bilaterally and hand tremors on outstretched extremities bilaterally. The remaining physical examination results were unremarkable.\\nSignificant initial laboratory results include the following: cross-linked dimeric degradation product (D-dimer), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high sensitive cardiac troponin I, and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) (Table 1). An elevated D-dimer prompted chest computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) (Figure 1), which revealed no signs of pulmonary embolism, patchy ground glass opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe, mild dependent changes with subsegmental atelectasis within the bilateral lower lobes, and mildly enlarged main pulmonary artery, suggestive of underlying pulmonary artery hypertension, with an upright X-ray showing signs of cardiomegaly (Figure 2). Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (Figure 3). A two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 36%, with diffuse mild dilation of the atria and ventricles and trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Video 1).\\nOn the second day of admission, the patient was placed in droplet isolation according to hospital policy due to COVID-19. It is important to note that the initial rapid at-home SARS-CoV-2 test was positive, but on hospital reassessment using PCR testing, the patient was found to be negative. Together with the lack of overt symptoms on physical examination, we suspect that this was likely a false-positive result. While SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy in rare cases, we did not believe that there was sufficient evidence in this patient to include it as a likely differential diagnosis. His free T4 was 6.58 ug/dL and total T3 was 459.37 ng/dL, with a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), indicating a hyperthyroid state. A thyroid ultrasound indicated an enlarged and relative hypervascular thyroid. However, due to the prior CTPA use of iodine, the radioactive iodine uptake study could not be completed. Nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) at rest and stress indicated no evidence of a fixed defect or stress-induced ischemia (Figure 4).\\nThe third day of admission resulted in serology studies, with thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin of 127 IU/L, thyroglobulin antibody < 1.0 IU/mL, thyroid peroxidase antibody of 281 IU/mLco, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody of 39.60 IU/L, indicating Grave's disease. The treatments provided were as follows: methimazole dosing titrated to 20 mg tablet, orally, twice daily; metoprolol 50 mg tablet, orally, daily; and Entresto 1 tablet (49/51 mg), orally, twice daily.

She had a recent vaginal delivery at home approximately ten weeks before this presentation and had ongoing intravenous drug use. Since the birth at home, she had lower abdominal pain but failed to seek medical attention. She also reported two to four weeks of generalized malaise, fever, and chills. She was febrile at the emergency room, with tachycardia of 105 beats per minute, normal blood pressure, and oxygen saturation >90% on room air. Based on her clinical history and physical examination findings such as tachycardia and severe lower abdominal tenderness, acute pulmonary embolism was a concern. She underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for further evaluation. Imaging revealed multiple small pulmonary emboli and findings concerning septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis and edema of the left clavicle. Based on her clinical presentation and risk factors, IE was suspected. Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital for further management.\\nOn arrival at our facility, the patient had a fever of 38.8ocelsius, tachycardia of 125 beats per minute, blood pressure of129/79 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Labs revealed leukocytosis of 19,000/mL with neutrophil predominance and normal renal and hepatic functions. Labs were significant for hypoalbuminemia and elevated inflammatory markers, including ESR (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate) of 100 mm/Hr and CRP (C-reactive protein) of 27 mg/dL. Her urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines and opiates, and she admitted to the daily use of heroin and methamphetamine. On physical examination, she was alert and oriented but appeared to be in painful distress, expressing significant abdominal and left shoulder pain. Lungs were clear on auscultation, whereas on the cardiac exam, a diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area was heard. She had severe suprapubic area tenderness on palpation. The left shoulder limited range of motion with no spine tenderness was appreciated on musculoskeletal examination. Left antecubital and buttock areas showed the presence of multiple needle marks with no signs of infection. A portable chest X-ray disclosed diffuse lung opacities suspicious of septic emboli (Figure 1). Empirically intravenous (IV) vancomycin and ceftriaxone were initiated for suspected IE treatment. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated an extensive mobile 3.7 x 0.5 cm vegetation on the pulmonary valve with moderate to severe pulmonic regurgitation (Figure 2). The patient refused a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) despite multiple requests. The cardiothoracic surgery team review of the TTE was negative for any left-sided IE stigmata.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder revealed acromioclavicular joint septic arthritis and abnormal marrow edema in the distal clavicle concerning for osteomyelitis (Figure 3). A subcentimeter abscess in the region of subacromial bursa was also seen (Figure 3). Pelvis MRI showed peripherally enhancing fluid collection from pubic symphysis compatible with septic arthritis and erosion in the left pubic body without confluent marrow replacement to indicate osteomyelitis and bilateral hip joint effusions (Figure 4). Blood cultures returned positive for MRSA within 12 hours, and they remained positive from the first day of hospitalization until day 7. The mean inhibitory concentration of vancomycin for MRSA was 1. The positive blood cultures resulted in the de-escalation of antibiotics to vancomycin alone.\\nThe patient underwent irrigation and debridement of the pelvic abscess and left shoulder joint. The cultures from the fluid aspiration of the left acromioclavicular joint and pubic symphysis grew MRSA confirming septic arthritis. On the 13th day of hospitalization, she underwent bioprosthetic pulmonic valve replacement and pulmonary artery reconstruction with autologous pericardial patch placement. Intraoperative echocardiogram did not reveal any left-sided IE stigmata. The special stain for fungal organisms was negative. Cultures from the valve were not sent due to positive blood and tissue cultures from the joint aspirations. Histopathology of the pulmonic valve vegetation revealed a partially necrotic cardiac valve with septic vegetations, numerous Gram-positive cocci in clusters, and pairs. After one week following cardiac valve surgery, she had dental extraction of the remaining upper teeth to optimize dental hygiene. After valve replacement, she was started on warfarin with an international normalized ratio goal of 2-3.\\nDue to the history of active ongoing intravenous drug abuse, outpatient parenteral antibiotics were deferred. Instead, the patient received intravenous antibiotics, inpatient, until completion of her antibiotic course. She completed the IE treatment with six weeks of vancomycin. Inpatient pharmacy managed the vancomycin dosing based on the trough levels. Vancomycin dosing was three times a day, and the average dose ranged from 750 mg to 1250 mg over six weeks. Her mean vancomycin trough levels ranged from 15 mcg/mL to 18 mcg/mL. Upon completing antibiotic therapy, the ESR had decreased to 32 mm/Hr and CRP decreased to 1.32 mg/dL. Before being discharged home, she underwent an evaluation by psychiatry for suboxone treatment. She was discharged home in a stable condition. Unfortunately, she was lost to the outpatient clinic follow-up and repeat imaging to ensure that the infection resolution could not be obtained.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 10-year-old Caucasian girl with history of vesicoureteral reflux grade 3 bilaterally, was transferred from an outside hospital with abdominal pain. The patient was complaining of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain 5 days prior to admission with worsening into the evening. The pain continued despite Tylenol and Motrin. It was described as achy, 7/10 in intensity, and was in the RUQ without radiation. There were no aggravating factors, and the pain had no association with food intake. She felt better when she was resting. She had an episode of diarrhea on the same day of pain onset and one episode of nonbilious/non-bloody vomiting 2 days prior to admission. Associated symptoms included a fever with a temperature of 100.4 F from 4 days prior to admission; she was responsive to treatment with Tylenol and Motrin. She developed a rash on the same day of fever onset. The rash first appeared on her neck and later spread to her face, upper, and lower extremities. The rash was not itchy or painful.\\nHer mother took her to urgent care 4 days prior to admission. She was sent home with reassurance and with a diagnosis of viral illness. She had poor appetite and decreased oral intake for 5 days before the admission. Her mother was concerned that she was still having abdominal pain, poor appetite, and rash. She took the patient to her pediatrician; who performed a rapid streptococcal antigen test (negative), and streptococcal throat culture was sent and was subsequently negative. She was provisionally diagnosed with scarlet fever and was started on amoxicillin therapy. Of note, there were no known sick contacts at home or school. She completed 2 days of amoxicillin, did not show any improvement, and so her mother took her to an outside hospital.\\nVitals at the outside hospital were temperature 37.4 C, heart rate 149/minute, blood pressure 106/57 mm Hg, respiratory rate 22/minute, and SpO2 96% on room air. Complete blood count showed white blood cells 12.2 k/mm3 (with 70% neutrophils, 14% lymphocytes, and 9% monocytes), hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, hematocrit 38.9%, platelets 439,000/mm3, serum sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, carbon dioxide 27 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 6 mg/dL, creatinine 0.45 mg/dL, serum glucose 106 mg/dL, calcium 10 mg/dL, total protein 7.2 g/dL, and albumin 3.7 g/dL. Alkaline phosphatase was high at 402 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 37 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was high at 111 U/L, Total bilirubin was high with total 2.2 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin was not available. Lipase was mildly elevated at 284 U/L. Urinalysis with microscopy showed specific gravity 1.014, bilirubin 1+, ketones +, urobilinogen 1, glucose -, nitrite -, LE trace, red blood cells 3 to 10/high-power field (HPF), white blood cells 3 to 10/HPF, and epithelial cells 6 to 30/HPF.\\nAbdominal ultrasound showed a prominent gallbladder that was distended measuring up to 4.6 cm in short axis. No gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid were noted. She received intravenous (IV) famotidine 10 mg, normal saline bolus at 20 cc/kg once, IV Zofran 4 mg, and was transferred to our tertiary care emergency department for further management.\\nIn our emergency department, vitals were temperature 36.9 C, heart rate 96/minute, respiratory rate 22/minute, blood pressure 101/68 mm Hg. Abdominal X-ray showed moderate retained stool on the right and left colon with a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 16.39 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mildly high at 36 mm/h, and direct bilirubin was 1.3 mg/dL.\\nAbdominal ultrasound (Figure 1) was repeated, which showed distention of the gallbladder measuring 4.3 cm in maximum transverse dimension that was stable when compared with the earlier study. Gallbladder wall hyperemia was noted on Doppler, and gallbladder wall thickness was at the upper limits of normal measuring 3 mm without evidence of biliary stone. There was mild pericholecystic fluid. A small amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant was noted. The appendix was not visualized.\\nShe was started on maintenance IV fluids and was sent to 23 hours observation unit.\\nIn the observation unit, the patient was hemodynamically stable and remained afebrile. She was noted to have an erythematous macular rash all over the body (Figure 2). She had conjunctival injection in both eyes with clear discharge. Symmetric tonsillar enlargement with mild erythema (2+) was noted. There were no tonsillar exudates. She had tenderness over the RUQ with a positive Murphy's sign on admission. There were no organomegaly or palpable masses. The rest of the examination was normal. She was kept NPO (nil per os) initially, started on IV ceftriaxone, and was continued on IV fluids\\nLaboratory tests were repeated on the day of discharge and showed the following: lipase 310 U/L, bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL, AST 44 U/L, ALT 89 U/L, C-reactive protein 9 mg/L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 27 mm/h.\\nInfectious Diseases consultation recommended evaluating for possible infectious causes of acalculous cholecystitis. Cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin Ig G and IgM (negative), anti-streptolysin O titer (negative), hepatitis panel (negative), infectious mononucleosis screen (negative), EBV serology panel (negative). Parvovirus B19 IgM was negative. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction panel was negative. Liver enzymes were retested, with the results AST 53 U/L and ALT 98 U/L. Diet was advanced slowly and the patient tolerated well without vomiting, diarrhea, or return of abdominal pain. Infectious Diseases consultation also recommended Mycoplasma IgG and IgM antibody testing. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM was positive. M pneumoniae IgG was negative. The patient was discharged home with oral azithromycin therapy. She followed-up in gastroenterology clinic a few weeks after discharge, where she was completely asymptomatic. ALT, AST, bilirubin, and lipase were repeated and were within normal limits. Her repeat ultrasound was normal with no signs of cholecystitis.\",\n",

The digital rectal examination revealed a large, soft, fluctuant mass arising from the prostate. TRUS revealed a cystic mass measuring 5 x 4 x 3.5 cm arising from the prostate and no left kidney was seen. On MRI, a tube-like structure meandering along the rear wall of the bladder was recognized as the lower portion of the left ureter. The mass showed low T1- and high T2-weighted signal intensity compatible with a cyst in the left seminal vesicle area (Figures 1 and 2). Enhanced CT revealed left renal agenesis and a retroperitoneal cystic lesion. The urine culture showed that E. coli was sensitive to all antibiotics tested and Q  max at uroflow was greater than 15 mL/second. As surgery is very demanding and features many complications, we decided to manage this disease conservatively with alpha-blockers and antibiotics. After 6-month followup, the patient did not report any complain and the uroflow test was similar to a normal urination.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A premature male was born at 28 weeks and five days gestation with a birth weight of 1,200 grams due to preterm labor. This was a dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy. The co-twin was selectively terminated at an outside hospital at 21 weeks' gestation for multiple congenital anomalies secondary to amniotic band syndrome. The mother, a 23-year-old Hispanic with no reported history of serious disease tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests 13 days before delivery and upon admission to the hospital. The mother was asymptomatic at presentation and reported no previous symptoms of COVID-19. She received antenatal steroids 29 days prior to delivery after she presented to the hospital with suspected rupture of membranes. Placental pathology of the co-twin showed acute chorioamnionitis with areas of fibrin deposition characteristic of intra-amniotic infection of an unidentified source.\\nAPGAR scores were 6 at 1 min and 9 at 5 min of life and initial resuscitation included positive pressure ventilation for one minute, followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5cmH2O. The infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on CPAP and FiO2 0.21. Chest x-ray showed mild diffuse hazy granular opacities consistent with respiratory distress syndrome (Figure 1A). A nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR at 24 h postnatal age was positive and remained positive until day of life (DOL) 26. Inflammatory markers showed elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) to 3 mg/dl (normal is <1 mg/dl) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) to 36.2 pg/ml (10x normal), which normalized by DOL 7. Serum antibodies (IgG, IgM) for SARS CoV-2 were undetectable on DOL 4, but present on DOL 19.\\nOn DOL 5, increasing oxygen requirement (FiO2 0.5) prompted treatment with dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg every 12 h for 3 days, 0.05 mg/kg every 12 h for 2 days) and remdesivir (5 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2.5 mg/kg/dose daily for 4 days). Chest x-ray at this point showed diffuse bilateral hazy opacities with increased perihilar markings (Figure 1B). Echocardiography was normal. By DOL 10, progressive respiratory failure required intubation, mechanical ventilation and FiO2 1.00. Chest x-ray now showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates (Figure 1C). Due to deteriorating respiratory status, the dexamethasone dose was increased to 0.1 mg/kg every 6 h for 2 days with subsequent tapering. Anakinra (a synthetic IL-1 receptor antagonist) was started on DOL 11 at 1 mg/kg/dose every 12 h. FiO2 requirements improved to 0.6, whereupon dexamethasone and anakinra were discontinued by DOL 30.\\nOn DOL 25, antibiotics were started for ventilator-associated pneumonia, presumedly due to respiratory cultures positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. On DOL 40, another course of dexamethasone was started at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 10 days, with some improvement in oxygen requirement, which worsened with dexamethasone taper. His FiO2 requirements increased further to 0.80-1.00, and a tracheostomy was performed on DOL 104. The infant continued to have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and high oxygen requirements despite multiple courses of empiric antibiotic treatment for presumed pneumonia. Echoencephalography was normal on DOL 5, 7, 14, 40, and 124. At 5 months of age, the infant's respiratory status progressively deteriorated and ventilatory support was withdrawn because of the extremely poor prognosis, and the infant soon expired.\\nLung pathology showed severe bronchopneumonia. To investigate the plausible role of hyperinflammation in the etiology of the severe progressive respiratory failure and potential systemic effects in this infant, we performed additional stains in the lung and heart for proteins potentially involved in macrophage and platelet activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation indicative of SARS CoV-2 hyperinflammation. We found, specifically, increased low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and phospo-NF-kB-p65 expression in lung macrophages and cardiomyocytes, increased osteopontin (OPN) and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in blood vessels in the lung and heart (Figure 2), and increased citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in the lung and blood vessels in the heart (Figure 2), indicating hyperinflammation with formation of NETs.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 4-month-old male entire indoor-only domestic shorthair cat was referred to the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies' Neurology Service for acute onset of right thoracic monoparesis following a fall from a chair. Clinical signs progressed rapidly and within 18 h the cat was unable to walk, with right hemiplegia, left hemiparesis and right Horner's syndrome. At this stage the patient was referred. On presentation the cat was quiet, alert and responsive; vitals were within normal limits; and a large, firm bladder was evident on abdominal palpation. Neurological examination revealed anisocoria with a miotic right pupil, cervical hyperaesthesia, right hemiplegia, left hemiparesis, thoracic limb hypotonia, pelvic limb hypertonia, right thoracic limb areflexia, absent deep pain in the right thoracic limb below the elbow and pelvic limb hyperreflexia. Neurolocalisation was to the C6-T2 spinal segments, with lateralisation to the right. Differential diagnoses were trauma, vascular event and infectious/inflammatory disease (feline infectious peritonitis/toxoplasmosis).\\nAn emergency CT scan (64-row multi-slice CT scanner; Somatom Definition AS) of the head and spine was performed shortly after admission; no structural abnormalities were identified to explain the clinical signs. Serum biochemistry and haematology identified no significant findings. An echocardiogram revealed trivial tricuspid regurgitation, no left atrial enlargement, no thrombus formation and good contractility. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) were within their respective reference intervals (RIs), and serum fibrinogen concentration was not increased: APTT 13.4 s (RI 10-20 s); PT 10.2 s (RI 5-12 s); and fibrinogen 3.2 g/l (RI 2-4 g/l). Testing for serum feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibody was negative (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test; IDEXX). Serum IgG and IgM antibody titre testing for Toxoplasma gondii was negative (<50 [Biobest Laboratories, Edinburgh]). Serum analysis for feline coronavirus antibody titre by immunofluorescence assay (<10) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein by radial immunodiffusion assay (0.5 g/l; RI 0.124-0.878 g/l) were both negative (Biobest Laboratories). Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a total cell count of 39.6/microl (RI <5/microl) and a total protein concentration of 1.28 g/l (RI <0.45 g/l). Cytology of the CSF fluid revealed increased red blood cells (RBCs) and scattered platelets. The nucleated cells were approximately 8/1000 RBCs and they comprised 30% non-degenerate neutrophils, 46% small and a few medium lymphocytes, 23% large mononuclear cells (monocytes and macrophages) and 1% eosinophils. One macrophage showed erythrophagocytosis; otherwise, cell morphology was unremarkable. No aetiological agents were seen. These findings were consistent with either local haemorrhage or blood contamination.\\nBased on history, neurological examination and investigations, a presumptive diagnosis of spinal cord trauma was made. Daily physiotherapy was initiated included passive range of motion (PROM) exercises. The patient was managed symptomatically with buprenorphine (20 mug/kg IV q8h), dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg IV q24h, increased to 0.2 mg/kg on result of negative T gondii), clindamycin (25 mg/kg PO q8h, withdrawn on result of negative toxoplasma), ranitidine (2 mg/kg IV q12h) and prazocin (250 mug/kg PO q8h) to aid frequent bladder expressions. Lactulose and enemas containing sodium citrate (450 mg) and sodium alkylsulfoacetate (45 mg [Micralax; RPH Pharmaceuticals]) were used to manage faecal retention. Seven days after the initial trauma the patient failed to show significant signs of improvement and appeared to have persistent cervical hyperaesthesia, despite analgesia and physiotherapy. Pre- and post-contrast MRI (3Philips Intera 1.5-T Pulsar System; Philips Medical Systems) study of the cervical and thoracic spine and brain was performed. All visible intervertebral discs showed normal T2 fluid intensity (Figure 1a). At C6-C7 the intervertebral disc was protruding into the mid-ventral vertebral canal, causing thinning of the subarachnoid space circumferentially and mild dorsal cord deviation (Figure 1b,c). Extending from C5-C6 to cranial C7, the spinal cord contained a large area of T1, T2 and T2* hyperintensity, with only the left dorsolateral aspect of the cord unaffected. In the same area, there was marked contrast enhancement of the right lateral aspect of the spinal cord (Figure 1d). MRI findings were therefore consistent with a C6-C7 acute non-compressive nucleus pulposus extrusion with secondary C5-C7 spinal cord chronic haemorrhage. The contrast enhancement was considered to be most likely due to vascular damage, inflammation secondary to the trauma and chronic haemorrhage. CSF analysis was repeated 7 days post-trauma and was consistent with normal CSF: total cell count 0 (RI <5/microl) and total protein concentration 0.35 g/l (RI <0.45 g/l), suggesting resolution of the previously suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage.\\nFollowing MRI, a splint was applied to the right thoracic limb to prevent knuckling and abrasion of the dorsal paw, and to assist ambulation. By 10 days post-trauma the anisocoria, cervical hyperaesthesia, left-sided paresis and postural deficits, pelvic limb hypertonus, and faecal and urinary retention had resolved. The kitten was able to run, jump and climb. However, the distal right thoracic limb was still paralysed, and over the preceding 10 days progressive contracture of the right carpus developed. PROM exercises elicited pain on extension of the carpus and flexion of the elbow, preventing the physiotherapy from being performed effectively. Splints were trialled, but they also elicited discomfort. Radiographs of the thoracic limbs were taken. No soft tissue abnormalities were detected. An 18  lateral deviation of the right carpus was evident, causing narrowing of the radiocarpal joint space affecting primarily the intermedioradial carpal bone. This was consistent with suspected contracture of the triceps and flexor muscles of the carpus and digits.\\nThe contracture resulted in the development of a non-weightbearing carpal hyperflexion (Figure 2). Amputation of the limb or a therapeutic trial with BTX were discussed; the owners elected for the latter. Under general anaesthesia, 90 units of BTX type A (BTX-A [Botox Cosmetic; Allergan]) were injected into the flexor muscles of carpus and digits, and 10 units into the triceps. The dose was similar to what has previously been shown to be safe in cats in an experimental study.   The aim of the treatment was to alleviate discomfort and reduce the muscle spasticity, allowing the use of a brace and physiotherapy to be performed. The patient was monitored in hospital for 48 h after the treatment; there were no adverse clinical reactions. The cat was discharged with a splint to aid ambulation; the owners were instructed to change the splint daily and perform daily physiotherapy.\\nAt a re-check 8 days post-BTX-A treatment the owners perceived the cat to be pain-free and ambulating well with support from the splint. The owners were managing well with the daily splint changes and rehabilitation exercises, although they reported that the cat resented the removal of the tape that kept the splint in place. Examination showed erythema where the tape was applied. The tape was replaced with a custom-made brace made with a spoon splint and Velcro straps. Repeat neurological examination showed that in the right thoracic limb postural reactions were still absent, sensation was decreased but now present at the second and fifth digit, and the muscle contractions had resolved but muscle tone was decreased. The postural reactions and tone in the other limbs were now normal. Mild hyperaesthesia of the cervical, epaxial and shoulder muscles was present, but there was a greatly improved level of comfort on manipulation of neck, right shoulder, elbow and carpus vs before BTX-A treatment. The owners reported that the cat was very active; we suspected that the neck and shoulder muscles were subjected to an increased load secondary to the reduced tone and function of the injected muscles of the right thoracic limb.\\nThe cat continued to make a clinical improvement. At 6 months post-BTX-A treatment, sensation was present but still decreased on the distal right thoracic limb. The right triceps brachii muscle was atrophied and a mild increase in muscle tone had returned. However, normal mobility was not impeded and the cat was pain free and able to place its right thoracic paw in a normal position when ambulating, only requiring support from the splint after prolonged periods of exercise (see the video in the supplementary material). The residual clinical signs did not appear to be affecting its quality of life.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"This 8-month-old female infant was admitted to the hospital with a severe lung infection, presenting with a recurrent cough and shortness of breath. Additionally, the infant demonstrated a significant difficulty in feeding and had a body length and weight below the 3rd percentile for her age, indicating developmental retardation. Her parents reported poor performance in motor function and a significant neurodevelopmental delay, with acute critical illness, malnutrition, and thin subcutaneous fat. The infant's head circumference measured 39 cm and she had a square skull with a large anterior fontanel measuring 3 x 3 cm. Her visual and hearing evaluations were normal. The infant also exhibited high levels of muscle tension and a rupture and scab on the top of the head. Two lower incisors had erupted, and the pharynx was red with hoarseness in her voice. Respiratory movements were symmetrical in both lungs with rough breath sounds, significant wet rales heard bilaterally, and occasional wheezing sounds. The apex beat was located in the lower left, and there was a sense of lift in the precordial area, with an enlarged heart boundary and increasing heart rate, though the heart sound was dull, and a level II-III systolic murmur was recorded. The abdomen was soft with a medium-textured liver located 6 cm below the subcostal margin and 4-5 cm below the xiphoid process, and a non-palpable spleen. The first and second toes on the left foot were dry and black, with clear boundaries between them and surrounding healthy tissue. The muscle strength was reduced to grade 3 in the upper limbs and grade 2 in the lower limbs, indicating global muscle weakness. She was unable to sit independently and failed to handle grasp building blocks by 12 months of age. Moreover, she failed to produce pronunciation clearly. A Gesell evaluation conducted at 12 months revealed a significant delay in gross and fine motor development. No pathological or meningeal irritation signs were present. The parents reported no positive family history of cardiac attack or cardiovascular disease and declined genetic sequencing analysis and third-generation in vitro fertilization in the next pregnancy. The mother's first pregnancy was terminated at 28 weeks due to awareness of fetal tetralogy of Fallot.\\nThe results of a blood gas analysis indicated the presence of metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.278, a BE of -11.8 mmol/L, and an  level of 13.3 mmol/L. The results of blood biochemical tests showed elevated levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (1526.27 pg/mL, normal range <146 pg/mL). No significant findings were identified in the results of hepatic and renal function tests. Elevated levels of blood ammonia (108 umol/L) were noted. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed abnormal signals in the right atrium and suspected right ventricular hypertrophy, as well as sinus tachycardia and ST segment changes (depression in lead I, II, III, aVF, and V3-V6 of 0.1-0.5 mV and an increase in aVR and V1 of 0.1-0.2 mV), as illustrated in Figure 1A. Heart failure and cardiac malformation were suspected, leading to the immediate performance of an echocardiogram. The echocardiogram identified a severe type of CHD, type I truncus arteriosus, with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO) (Figure 1B). The aorta was found to be in the right position, with mild semilunar valve regurgitation. The neurological system was assessed through cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning, which showed the presence of bilateral apical, occipital, and temporal subdural effusions; slightly wider bilateral lateral ventricles and annular cisterns; and bilateral cerebral hemispheric parenchyma atrophy (Figure 1C). Chest CT scanning also identified the presence of pulmonary infection and enlargement of the left atrium and left ventricle, while CT scanning did not show any abnormalities in the kidneys.\\nIn the analysis of the proband, a novel homozygous mutation in the TMEM260 gene was identified. The c.1336_1339DEL homozygous variant was found to result in a frameshift mutation in the amino acid sequence (p.L447Vfs*9). The parents of the proband were found to be carriers of the variant by WES analysis and did not exhibit any clinical manifestations (Figure 2A). No other cardiovascular-related variants were identified in the proband or her parents. The frequency of this mutation in the general population is not recorded in any database (Figure 2B). The identified frameshift mutation resulted in the deletion of a few bases (TCTC) from positions 1336 to 1339 in the TMEM260 gene. This led to a change in amino acid 447 from leucine to valine and the creation of a stop codon after the ninth amino acid, causing a structural deletion in the TMEM260 protein and resulting in the loss of gene function (Figure 2C). According to MutationTaster analysis, the variant was determined to be a disease-causing mutation with a probability value of 1.00. The frameshift deletion caused a complete disruption in the structure of the TMEM260 protein, particularly in the transmembranous part, which impaired its normal molecular function. As the structure and function of the TMEM260 protein are not well understood, the discovery of this pathogenic site is of great significance for advancing the understanding of this protein. A summary of all reported variants of TMEM260 is presented in Figure 2D and Table 1.\\nThe infant was diagnosed with a severe and complex CHD of type I persistent truncus arteriosus, VSD, and a right aortic arch. The infant also displayed critical neurodevelopmental delay and neurological dysfunction. Despite undergoing a multi-phase surgical correction and receiving treatment with anti-infection measures, myocardial protection, inotropic agents, and mechanical ventilation, the patient suffered several cardiac arrests during hospitalization in the cardiac care unit. These were managed with prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\\nPost-surgery, the patient developed severe antibiotic-resistant infections, including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Elizabethkingia meningitidis, and was treated with tigacycline, polymyxin, and sulperazon.\\nDuring follow-up, the patient presented with recurrent heart failure and pulmonary infections. Echocardiography showed dilation of the aorta, a small shunt through the interventricular septum, slightly accelerated forward blood flow through the artificial pulmonary valve with slightly strong ultrasound signals, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a slightly reduced left ventricular contractile function. The patient also experienced regression in motor performance, and a follow-up cranial CT scan revealed aggressive progression of cerebral atrophy (Figure 1D).\",\n",

The omentum was carefully divided with bipolar diathermy taking care not to expose the underlying mesh. The omental adhesiolysis in the right iliac fossa revealed a small amount of free fluid and a turgid appendix overlying and adherent to the peritonealised Mesh from the previous right laparoscopic inguinal herniorraphy [Figures 2 and 3]. The turgid appendix was carefully dissected off the peritonealised Mesh using sharp and blunt dissection; again taking care not to expose the underlying Mesh. An uncomplicated laparoscopic appendicectomy was performed, and a local washout with normal saline completed the procedure.

The results of positron emission tomography (PET) showed that the patient had tumor metastasis in the right cervical lymph node, in addition to primary lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung. Thus, the right lymph node was removed surgically for pathologic diagnosis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed the presence of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion. The patient subsequently received crizotinib as first-line treatment for 11 months and alectinib as second-line treatment for 24 months.\\nDue to the development of drug resistance, after onset of severe backache, oligoprogression involving third to fifth lumbar vertebrae was found by computed tomography (CT) and validated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, the patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with the dose of 30 Gy/5f for the lumbar lesion from 10 January 2020 to 16 January 2020. Pain relief of the patient was persistently observed after SBRT. Follow-up MRI on March 2, 2020, showed that the soft tissue of metastasis lesions around the lumbar spine reduced significantly, while CT showed that the primary lung lesion was slightly enlarged ( Figure 1 ).\\nA 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PCV) (Pneumovax, MSD) was given 3 months later after radiotherapy, on 6 April 2020, as a precautionary measure to prevent pneumonia. Strikingly, a routine CT on 21 April 2020 showed a significant enlargement of the primary focus after the injection of PCV ( Figure 1 ). In order to avoid further possible progress, resection was conducted on 28 April 2020. Impressively, an abscopal complete response (CR) of primary lesion in the right lung was pathologically confirmed after the resection. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that the primary lung lesion was mainly composed of map-like necrosis ( Figure 2A ), while there was a small amount of ALK-positive tumor cells that remained in the lumbar bone marrow of metastasis lesion ( Figure 2B ). Pathologically, multifocal granulomas were formed in the primary pulmonary lesion, with thin-walled capillaries and proliferative fibroblasts on the edge of the tumor bed and peripherally infiltrating immune cells around the central necrosis ( Figure 2A ). There were multinucleated giant cells accumulating and a reactive proliferating vasculum in the tumor bed. In addition, early tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were formed in the primary lesion ( Figure 2A ). Tissue scan by imaging mass cytometry (Fluidigm company) showed primary lesion infiltrated by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which include CD4+/CD8+ memory T cells, CD68+ tissue macrophage cells, and CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells ( Figures 3A-C ). These results indicated that the primary lesion experienced a robust immune response. After radiotherapy, the patient kept taking the second-generation ALK TKI regularly (alectinib tablets, 600 mg twice a day).

The patient was an office worker with no past medical history except for well-controlled hypertension and diabetes for 10 years. Two months prior, he complained of sudden onset of pain in both shoulders and developed the weakness of both shoulder girdles 2 days later. The weakness in the left shoulder girdle progressed, and weakness in the left wrist and finger extensors newly developed over the next 4 weeks. There were no preceding trauma, immunization, or fever, but he reported weight loss (7 kg) over the 1 month before pain onset. The patient had never regularly exercised other than walking for glycemic control. The symptoms did not change for the next 1 month before admitting to our hospital. A neurological examination showed paresis of shoulder abduction [right: medical research council grade (MRC) 4/5, left: MRC 3/5], elbow flexion (right: MRC 4/5, left: MRC 3/5), elbow extension (right: MRC 4/5, left: MRC 3/5), wrist flexion (right: MRC 4/5, left: MRC 4/5), wrist extension (right: MRC 4/5, left: MRC 2/5), and extension of fingers (right: MRC 4/5, left: MRC 2/5). The muscle power of bilateral finger flexion and lower limbs was normal. A hypesthesia area was identified in the lateral sides of bilateral shoulders and arms, and deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the upper limbs. Atrophy of both shoulder girdles was observed (Figure 1). A complete blood cell count and routine biochemical analysis were normal except for fasting glucose (151 mg/dl) and HbA1c (7.3%). Other serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, C, and E, syphilis, and autoimmune diseases including angiotensin-converting enzyme, anti-nuclear antibody, double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative. An initial nerve conduction study (NCS), performed 2 months after symptom onset, showed a decrease of compound muscle action potential amplitude in the left musculocutaneous nerve (Figure 2A, recording of the biceps brachii muscle) and axillary nerve (Figure 2B, recording of the deltoid muscle) and a significant asymmetry of sensory nerve action potentials of the left lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (2.0 muV) compared to the right side (5.0 muV). NCS findings of the bilateral median, ulnar, peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves were normal. Needle electromyography (EMG) showed various degrees of denervation potentials in bilateral infraspinatus, supraspinatus, left deltoid, left triceps, left extensor digitorum, and left flexor carpi radialis muscles. There was reduced recruitment of motor unit in bilateral serratus anterior and right deltoid muscles. The results of initial electrophysiological studies suggested the involvement of bilateral upper and middle trunks (C5-C7) of the brachial plexus, particularly a more severe involvement of the left brachial plexus. Ultrasound with a 18-6-MHz linear transducer was performed on the same day as NCS/EMG and showed no swelling in the brachial plexus, median, radial, ulnar nerves. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus was carried out 3 days after NCS/EMG, showing mild swelling without enhancement at the cord level of the left brachial plexus. Based on the clinical history of the acute intense pain of shoulders and weakness of upper limbs with preceding weight loss, considering the involvement of bilateral upper and middle branches of brachial plexus in the electrophysiological studies and having excluded other causes by imaging and serological studies, a diagnosis of diabetic NA was made. Oral steroid (1 mg/kg) was administered 9 weeks after symptom onset and tapered over 4 weeks. Bilateral shoulder pain and weakness, except for weakness of the left wrist and finger extensors, improved. In the follow-up study of the left axillary (Figure 2C) and musculocutaneous (Figure 2D) nerves 4 weeks after the initial study, the amplitude of compound muscle action potential was improved. However, on the conduction study of the left radial nerve that was not included in the initial study, we detected a conduction block between the spiral groove and the elbow (Figure 2E, recording of the extensor indicis muscle). The nerve action potentials of bilateral superficial radial sensory nerves were symmetric. A 4-week follow-up ultrasound revealed constriction of the left posterior interosseous fascicle within the left radial nerve at 1.5 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle (Figures 3A-D). Surgical exploration for nerve constriction was considered but refused by the patient. Therefore, low-dose oral steroids and a rehabilitation program were continued for another 2 months. A 5-month follow-up NCS revealed a persistent conduction block of the left radial nerve (Figure 2F). The weakness of the left wrist and finger extensors was unchanged (MRC 2/5), but other remaining upper limb muscles were normal, except for the left shoulder abduction (MRC 4/5), left elbow flexion (MRC 4/5), and extension (MRC 4/5). Surgical exploration was performed 6 months after symptom onset and confirmed fascicular constriction at the area identified by ultrasound, for which interfascicular neurolysis was performed (Figures 3E,F). During the 16-month follow-up, the weakness in the wrist and finger extensors did not improve (MRC 2/5). We considered a tendon transfer to improve hand function a year after neurolysis, but the patient did not want secondary surgery.',\n",

Figure 1a-c illustrates scar tissue on the right thigh and peri-patellar areas 18 months after a severe de-gloving injury. The patient did receive acute local treatment (debridement and split thickness graft [SSG]) but following partial loss of the graft, most of the wound had healed by secondary intention. Despite the application of pressure garments, the resultant area demonstrated hypertrophic scarring with some areas being painful and extending beyond the site of injury consistent with keloid scaring. The child had a history of repeated episodes of purulent discharge from crypts within the scar tissue and reports of local hospital admission for drainage of crypt abscesses and antibiotic therapy. The patient presented to our clinic with open, unstable areas within the scar that were contaminated with swab-proven staphylococcus aureus, sensitive to co-amoxiclav. The rationale for the application of Integra in this case was to remove unstable scar and crypts that were causing ongoing issues, minimise further donor site morbidity, improve cosmesis and provide a reconstruction with superior elasticity to accommodate growth.\\nThe first surgical goal was to create a clean surgical field in preparation for Integra application. Visible crypts were excised and open areas debrided, removing potential foci of contamination/infection (Figure 2a, b). Once the area was clean, and bacterial swab negative, the remaining unstable, unaesthetic scar would be excised and resurfaced with a two-stage, standard, Integra application. This would be done as an outpatient with regular review.\\nDespite our careful planning to decrease the risk of Integra loss, one factor not bargained for was the weather! Gaza had the warmest summer on record for 80 years with temperatures topping 45 C during the day. Manufacturer instructions state that the dermal regeneration template must be kept between 2 C and 30 C. During this period in Gaza, electricity was rationed with households receiving a supply of 4 hours per day. Fortunately, our pharmacy had air-conditioning with a 24 hours back-up generator supply. Although this allowed us to store the product, the ambient temperature during transfer of the product and application would have been well above the recommended storage temperature. For this reason, the surgical plan was changed to cleaning up the boy's open areas within the scar tissue at one mission and two months later, on the following mission, a second surgeon (first author), would attempt application of the dermal regeneration matrix.\",\n",

WHO's Technical Advisory Group requests countries to continue to be vigilant because of potential significant rise in the number of infections. Although these variants might resist neutralizing antibodies in the blood, the vaccine allows preventing severe illness and death. Unlike several countries, Saudi Arabia was spared from the lack of oxygen generators, the most important medical equipment for hospitalized patients. The main concern is, however, regulations regarding vaccination. The vaccine was made mandatory for individuals over 12 years old.

Frozen sections from each were examined. Microscopic examination showed a complete replacement of the normal testicular tissue by sheets and nests of large round and polygonal cells with defined cell borders, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round central nuclei. Nests of cells were separated by dense fibrous tissue [Figure 2]. The morphological features were of \"LCT-like\" lesion! Nevertheless, Reinke crystals were not seen.

On admission, physical examination revealed mild tachypnea, an omphalocele, and multiple erythematous skin lesions. Her skin lesions were located on the back, shoulders, the lateral surfaces of the arms, and on the anterior medial side of the right thigh. Laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, blood sugar, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, acid-base values, and C-reactive protein levels as well as urinalysis were all normal. Antibiotic therapy was initiated because infection could not be ruled out and terminated after three days  when blood cultures were reported to be sterile. The patient's tachypnea resolved on oxygen therapy within 24 hours and the omphalocele was corrected surgically on the fifth day of admission. On the first week of admission, the skin lesions transformed into red-purple, firm and painful subcutaneous nodules (Figure 1).  These findings were consistent with the early lesions of fat necrosis of the newborn, and a skin biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy material obtained from the lesion border revealed a small number of lymphocytes and focal inflammatory areas consisting of histiocytes (Figure 2a). Additionally, there were radial eosinophilic crystals in the fat cells (Figure 2b). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as ScFN. Spontaneous improvement was observed in the lesions during the first  two weeks following the diagnosis. The baby's parents were informed about the risk of hypercalcemia and its signs and symptoms. The patient was discharged on the 15th day of admission. Vitamin-D prophylaxis was not initiated. The lesions progressively disappeared over the following four weeks without any complication.  Serum Ca and P levels were monitored twice per month after discharge. Serum Ca, P, ALP, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels during admission and follow-up were all within normal ranges and are given in Table 1. A slight increase was noted in  serum Ca levels during the follow-up period. The patient was breast-fed throughout the follow-up period.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 15-year-old girl weighing 32 kg presented to us with effort intolerance and significant central cyanosis. Her oxygen saturations were 78%. There was pulmonary oligemia and normal-sized heart on the chest X-ray. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, right axis deviation, and RV hypertrophy. Her echocardiogram showed a 11-mm anterior muscular VSD shunting right to left, with severe valvar pulmonic stenosis (PS). On cardiac catheterization, the RV systolic pressures were 40 mmHg more than aortic pressures. The pulmonary artery (PA) pressures were normal and the valvar gradient across the pulmonary valve was 120 mmHg. Right ventriculogram showed thickened and doming pulmonary valve; infundibulum showed dynamic systolic infundibular clamping, but opened well in diastole [Figure 1 and Video 1]. Left ventriculogram revealed a moderate sized mid muscular VSD.\\nAfter ensuring adequate intravascular volume status as shown by right atrial mean pressures of 12 mmHg, an initial BPV with 20-mm Tyshak II balloon (Numed Inc, Hopkinton, NY) resulted in excessive pulmonary flows, mild pulmonary hypertension, reduction of RV systolic pressures to 20 mmHg below the systemic pressures, and normalization of oxygen saturations to 100%. The subvalvar gradient was 60 mmHg and infundibulum opened well in diastole. The VSD was closed with a 14-12 Amplatzer Duct Occluder (StJude Medical, St Paul, MN) from the right ventricle after establishing an arteriovenous circuit [Figure 2 and Video 2]. After release, the RV pressure increased transiently due to dynamic infundibular hyper-contractility and the retention skirt of the device partially protruded into the left ventricle [Figure 3 and Video 3]. The device was snared out from the left ventricle before embolization. The device was replaced with an 18-mm muscular VSD occluder (HeartR, Lifetech Scientific, Shenzhen, PRC) [Figure 4 and Video 4]. Even though device appeared tilted towards the left ventricle on left ventriculogram, right ventriculogram showed correct device orientation [Figure 5 and Video 5]. On the following day, few ventricular ectopics were noted on routine examination and echocardiogram showed embolization of the device to the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). The large size of the device did not permit movement of the device beyond the aortic annulus. A snare catheter advanced into the LVOT to retrieve the device. There was transient heart block needing temporary RV pacing [Figure 6 and Video 6]. The device was subsequently snared into the abdominal aorta, but the screw end was facing superiorly. The profile of the device could be made smaller if the device could be slenderized by re-screwing the delivery cable to the device. It is important to slenderize the device to its smallest profile so that it could be removed through the smallest feasible arterial sheath. Through a 6 French left brachial artery access, a 6 French multipurpose guiding catheter was advanced into the abdominal aorta. This catheter allowed passage of a delivery cable of Amplatzer duct occluder I device. The large device was slenderized by re-screwing this cable [Figure 7 and Video 7]. The non-screw end of the left ventricular retention skirt of the device was snared with a small 5-mm Amplatz GooseNeck Snare (ev3 Inc, Plymouth, MN) and the device successfully withdrawn through a 9F femoral arterial sheath. She developed progressive hypotension in the intensive care unit in the subsequent few hours, which warranted initiation of inotropic support with dopamine, dobutamine, and adrenaline. Intravenous fluids were not given despite hypotension due to the concern of excessive pulmonary blood flows through the VSD. The hypotension progressively worsened inspite of escalating inotropes; there was progressive severe hypoxia due to right to left shunt across the VSD despite ventilation with 100% oxygen, metabolic acidosis, and progressive anemia. While examining for causes of low hemoglobin levels of 6 g/dl, a large right iliac retroperitoneal hematoma was recognized. The dangerous combination of inotrope-induced hypercontractile RV infundibulum, severe intravascular volume depletion, and poor oxygen carrying capacity due to anemia triggered a severe \"hypercyanotic spell\". This was recognized on echocardiogram by under-filled hypercontractile ventricles and collapsed inferior vena cava. Blood transfusion, intensive hydration, infusions of phenylephrine, and complete withdrawal of other sympathomimetics aided immediate recovery within few minutes. The retroperitoneal contained bleed was managed conservatively. One month later, transjugular device closure of the VSD was done with a 20-mm muscular VSD device (HeartR, Lifetech Scientific, Shenzhen, PRC) after establishing arterio-venous circuit. During the previous attempts of device delivery through femoral access, the alignment of the device was never proper in relation to the plane of the ventricular septum. Inspite of a better alignment of the sheath with the septum through the jugular route compared with the previous femoral attempts, the device developed cobra deformity and slipped repeatedly into the RV. The VSD device was reintroduced and the tip of left ventricular disk was protruded out and the delivery sheath placed in the ascending aorta. The tip of the left ventricular retention skirt was caught with a 5-mm Gooseneck Snare (ev3 Inc, Plymouth, MN) passed from femoral arterial access. This maneuver allowed holding the RV end of the device with the screw to the cable and left ventricular end of the device with the snare. This stabilization of the device from both ends permitted successful deployment [Figure 8 and Video 8]. At her last follow-up after 14 months, she is asymptomatic with no residual VSD and infundibular gradient of 20 mmHg.',\n",

When the patient was hospitalized, 2 weeks after the initial symptoms, he began to experience progressive fatigue. He did not experience fever, weight loss, night sweats, anorexia, cough, dyspnea, or chest pain, and did not produce sputum.\\nResults of the clinical examination were normal. The Mantoux test, performed with 10 IU of purified tuberculin (Aventis-Pasteur-MSD, Lyon, France), yielded a maximum transverse diameter of induration of 15 mm. Laboratory values were normal (Table). The chest X-ray showed a triangular consolidation of the left upper lobe with blurred limits and small cavitary lesions. No other contiguous mediastinohilar anomalies were visible. A computed tomographic scan confirmed the cavitary syndrome: three excavated nodular images showed radiating spicules within a micronodular infiltrate. Bronchoscopy showed a moderate inflammation of airway mucosa, especially in the left upper lobe. Biopsy specimens exhibited nonspecific inflammation.\\nA bronchial washing smear from the left upper lobe was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Serologic tests for HIV-1 and HIV-2 were negative. No evidence of disease was found elsewhere; the patient did not experience bone pain. Results of neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations were normal; no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly were found and the genitalia were normal. Auscultation revealed no pericardial fremitus; no ascitic fluid was detected. The urinary sediment contained <1,000 red blood cells/L and <5,000 leukocytes/L. Antituberculosis chemotherapy was begun with four drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.

He was a nurse and had been occasionally in charge at the Djibouti Hospital for 2 years. His medical history was unremarkable. Eight months before he returned to France, he experienced asthenia, anorexia, and a weight loss of 3 kg. The symptoms resolved spontaneously after 2 months, and he had been asymptomatic since then. He had no history of cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, or night sweats.\\nResults of a clinical examination and of laboratory studies were normal (Table), except for hypereosinophilia. Serologic tests for schistosomiasis, hydatidosis, distomiasis, amebiasis, toxocariasis, and trichinosis were negative, and parasites were not found in stool samples. Thoracic radiographs performed when he came back from Djibouti showed parenchymal consolidation of the right upper lobe with small cavities. Sputum was not produced. A gastric aspirate smear was negative for acid-fast bacilli, and a bronchial aspiration smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli. HIV serology was negative, and no other site of the infection was found. Drug therapy was initiated with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 2 months. Cultures of bronchial aspirates were positive within 14 days; later, cultures of two gastric aspirates were positive for acid-fast bacilli. An M. tuberculosis subsp. canetti isolate was identified, which was susceptible to all primary antituberculous drugs. The treatment was then extended for 4 months with rifampicin and isoniazid. The patient's response to treatment was favorable.\\nThe following methods were used to identify the etiologic agent. First, the samples were decontaminated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine/NaOH. Acid-fast bacilli were detected by auramine staining, the positive smears also were stained with Ziehl-Nielsen stain. The samples were then seeded onto Lowenstein-Jensen and Coletsos slants and also into a liquid system, the BBL Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT, BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD).\\nThe mycobacteria were identified by using a specific DNA probe (Gen-Probe, Gen-Probe Incorporated, San Diego, CA) and by performing the usual biochemical tests (nitrate reduction, 68 C catalase resistance, niacin production).\\nThe Pasteur Institute of Paris used two methods for typing: restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and spoligotyping. In RFLP analysis, after digestion of the M. tuberculosis strain's genomic DNA with PvuII restriction enzyme and agarose gel migration, the DNA was transferred on a membrane, according to the Southern method, and then hybridized with an insertion sequence IS6110 probe. In the spoligotyping method, after DNA direct repeat amplification, the labeled polymerase chain reaction product was used as a probe to hybridize with 43 synthetic spacer oligonucleotides (DNA sequences derived from the direct repeat [DR] region of M. tuberculosis, H37Rv and M. bovis BCG P3), which were attached to a carrier membrane. The sensitivity to antituberculous drugs was determined by the indirect proportion method.\\nMGIT results were positive for the two cultures in 9 and 12 days, respectively. On Lowenstein-Jensen slants, the cultures were positive in 12 and 14 days, respectively. The white, smooth, and glossy colonies were characteristic of M. tuberculosis subsp. canetti (Figure 1). The two strains had the same phenotypic and genotypic pattern; 68 C catalase was negative, and they reduced nitrate, as do other M. tuberculosis species, but they did not produce niacin. The DNA probe, Gen-Probe, confirmed that these strains belonged to the M. tuberculosis complex.\\nThese strains contained two copies of IS6110. Spoligotyping showed that they shared only 2 of the 43 oligonucleotides reproducing the spacer DNA sequences of M. tuberculosis, H37Rv and M. bovis BCG P3. This profile is characteristic of M. tuberculosis subsp. canetti (Figure 2).\",\n",

Two days post-surgery the patient developed headache with high-grade fever that did not respond to antibiotics. Headache became progressively worse and the patient started experiencing episodes of fits and loss of consciousness.\\nAssessment of vital signs on presentation revealed a temperature of 37 C, pulse of 112 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/97 mmHg. The physical examination revealed no meningeal signs, pupils were normal and reactive, and there was normal muscles tone. Glasgow Coma Scale was 6 (E1 M4 V1), so the patient was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated.\\nLaboratory testing revealed a leukocyte count of 10,380 cells per cubic millimeter, with 76.5% polymorphonuclear cells. ESR was 42 mm/h and CRP 7.97 mg/dl. The comprehensive metabolic panel; including liver-function tests, was within normal limits (Table 1).

Gram stain of CSF showed no bacteria, but white blood cells were increased at 4200 white cells/mul; 90% polymorphonuclear cells.\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head showed dilatation of supra and infratentorial ventricular system with hydrocephalic changes. CT scan also suggested possible fungal sinusitis of ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses. Other findings were not remarkable and showed normal attenuation of cerebral cortex and white matter, no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage and normal posterior fossa structures (Figure 1). CT of the chest showed left lower lobe consolidation with right upper lobe linear atelectasis and mild ground glass density patches. Mediastinal vascular structures were normal with no lymph node enlargement, no pleural effusion, and normal chest wall.\\nThe patient was started on intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, metronidazole, clindamycin, and glucocorticoids.\\nRoutine bacterial cultures of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid were negative, and microscopic examination of CSF revealed acute inflammatory cells (neutrophil leucocytes) and few admixed histocytes with conclusion of pyogenic meningitis.\\nOn hospital day 3 the patient had signs of brain stem death in the form of dilated fixed unreactive pupils, loss of corneal and conjunctival reflexes and loss of gag reflexes. Brain death was confirmed twice clinically by neurology department with an interval of 24 h. Electroencephalography (EEG) was advised as proof of brain stem death by electrophysiological studies.\\nOn hospital day 4, the patient showed abrupt elevation of blood glucose, urea, creatinine, and liver enzymes. EEG was done using brain death standard technique for 30 min and revealed severe cerebral dysfunction. Patient was continued on mechanical ventilation, but his blood pressure started to decrease. The patient immediately received Alpha/Beta agonists in an attempt to maintain his blood pressure at acceptable levels.\\nOn hospital day 5, the microbiology laboratory reported a filamentous fungus growth in the CSF specimen, which was initially negative for bacteria. This positive CSF specimen was collected on the first day of admission. The filamentous fungus was later identified as Aspergillus species and the culture was sent to a reference mycology laboratory for species identification. Liposomal Amphotericin B and voriconazole were started on the same day, but patient continued to deteriorate. The patient died on hospital day 7 due to sudden cardiac arrest associated with severe meningioencephalitis, renal impairment, and septic shock.\\nThe CSF specimen was cultured in BACTEC FX blood culture bottles and incubated using BACTEC FX system.

Incidentally, on an X-ray examination, a lung nodule on the right side was pointed out to her, although there were not any related symptoms. A contrast-enhanced chest CT scan revealed a solitary and well-circumscribed nodule (36 x 37 x 40 mm in diameter) in the peripheral region of the right lower lobe (Fig. 1A). While a solid part of the tumor was homogeneously enhanced, the tumor included an irregular-shaped low-density area (19 mm in maximum diameter) that was free from contrast-enhancement (Fig. 1B). Lymph node enlargement or pleural effusion was absent. Her medical record showed that a small lung nodule was previously recognized on a CT scan in our hospital when she was 54 years old (Fig. 1C). A further CT scan had been scheduled, but she missed her follow-up. The initial CT scan when her was 54 years old showed a small nodule (7.5 x 7.9 x 8.7 mm in diameter) in the right lower lobe (Fig. 1C, an arrow mark), which corresponded with the grown tumor in the present study. The tumor doubling time was estimated to be 374 days. She had never smoked and was taking medicines for hypertension.\\nThe patient was suspected of having a stage IB primary lung cancer after an evaluation of her whole body via contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic response imaging scans. A fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed a high maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 5.2 on the solid part of the lung nodule while a portion of intratumoral radiolucency did not show significant FDG uptake (Fig. 1D). Following this, a diagnostic CT-guided transcutaneous core needle biopsy was scheduled. The biopsy specimen obtained from the solid part of the tumor was composed of two major pathological patterns, a solid proliferation of round cells and papillary growth of type II pneumocyte-like cuboidal cells overlying a core comprised of round cells (Fig. 2A and B). Sclerotic and hemorrhagic patterns were also evident in minor regions (Fig. 2C and D). All of the four characteristic components necessary for a diagnosis of PSP were pathologically proven in a biopsy specimen.\\nSince the tumor doubling time was relatively short in this case, she received a right lower lobectomy and a lymphadenectomy at the Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations, Tachikawa Hospital. An examination of the gross features of the fixed lung revealed an encapsulated tumor (30 x 35 x 35 mm in size) underneath the visceral pleura in the right lower lobe accompanying a cavitary space filled with bloody content (Fig. 3A and B). The cavity formation was pathologically attributed to a gross hematoma but not to the hemorrhagic cyst nor to tumor necrosis. The microscopic examination of a solid part of the resected tumor confirmed a diagnosis of PSP, predominantly showing a papillary growth pattern with a portion of solid and sclerotic patterns (Fig. 3C). Immune-staining was positive for cytokeratin 7 (Fig. 3D), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) (Fig. 3E), and napsin A (Fig. 3F) on the papillary-growing type II pneumocyte-like cuboidal cells whereas solid-growing round cells were positive only for TTF-1 (Fig. 3E). Together, the immune staining patterns were consistent with those related to PSP. Lymph node metastasis was pathologically absent in the surgical specimens.',\n",

Six days prior, he was seen at the ER for back pain radiating to the right leg for the last two weeks, and x-rays of the right knee and hip with pelvis were within normal limits. He was discharged home with oral prednisone 40 mg daily for five days and as needed diazepam. He was a farmworker, had quit smoking a month back with 30 pack-years of smoking, and was negative for substance and alcohol abuse. He was sexually active with his girlfriend and resided in a trailer. Clinical examination revealed stable vital signs, lack of sensation over the right anterolateral thigh with no point tenderness, painful hip movements with limited motion, and difficulty walking. Labs revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated inflammatory markers (Table 1). He received intravenous (IV) ketorolac 30 milligrams (mg) followed by hydromorphone 0.5 mg 1 dose IV, ondansetron 4 mg IV, and oral diazepam 2 mg. Contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed right upper lobe (RUL) heterogeneous enhancing mass and scattered bilateral nodules < 6 millimeters (Fig. 1), right iliac diffuse permeative appearance, extensive complex septated acute collections within the right iliopsoas region, deep right gluteal region and the right paraspinal musculature from the L4 - S2 levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and lumbar spine with and without contrast revealed a large multilobulated cystic mass centered around the right iliac bone with extension medially into portions of the iliopsoas muscle, laterally into the adjacent gluteal musculature, and posterosuperiorly into the posterior paraspinal musculature (Fig. 2). He was admitted and initiated on pain control, IV fluids, and evaluated by the oncology and orthopedics team, who recommended a biopsy or transfer to a tertiary center. On day two, he was febrile at 39.2 Celsius (C) and ordered blood cultures returned negative, whereas procalcitonin and lactic acid were elevated (Table 1). Empirical IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin were started for suspected right upper lobe pneumonia, and his lactic acid improved. Over the next three days, antibiotics were continued, and on day six, he was transferred to our institution for suspected primary bone malignancy with metastasis.\\nOn arrival, clinical examination revealed fever (39 C), mild improvement of the right hip movements, and poor oral hygiene. Labs revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and two sets of blood cultures returned negative (Table 2). IV antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. He then underwent an interventional radiology-guided biopsy of the right ilium and aspiration of 20 mL purulent fluid from the right gluteal mass as recommended by the orthopedic oncology team. He remained intermittently febrile over the next two days, which gradually subsided with his right hip pain improvement. The bone biopsy revealed extensive acute and chronic inflammation with focal granulomatous change and no malignancy. The aspirated purulent fluid showed extensive necroinflammation, bacterial colonies most consistent with Actinomyces (Fig. 3) and no malignant cells. Right pelvic fluid histopath revealed the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon (sulfur granules and associated inflammation) (Fig. 4). The infectious disease (ID) team recommended continuing the piperacillin-tazobactam and stopping the vancomycin. Inflammatory markers were still elevated, whereas Quantiferon Gold Tuberculosis testing and serology for human immunodeficiency virus were negative (Table 2). A repeat contrasted CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis confirmed the prior pulmonary findings, whereas, in the pelvis, there was an interval increase in the size of the complex cystic mass indicative of abscess formation. He then underwent irrigation and debridement of the right hemipelvis and an open right ilium biopsy. Right ilium biopsy returned positive for acute and chronic osteomyelitis and negative for cancer. The right pelvic mass biopsy revealed fibrovascular tissue with acute and chronic inflammation, necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and negative for malignancy. Intraoperative tissue bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal cultures were negative. The pulmonary team performed the bronchoscopy and obtained an RUL protective specimen brush culture sample, bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) for analysis, culture, and endemic fungal workup. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided fine-needle aspiration on enlarged lymph nodes (stations 11 L,7, and 4 R) returned negative for infection and malignancy. BAL fluid analysis did not suggest any infection; however, the cultures returned positive for A. odontolyticus (Table 2). A. odontolyticus was sensitive to penicillin and resistant to clindamycin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was changed to ceftriaxone 2 g (gm) daily.\\nAn oral dental surgeon evaluated his bad oral hygiene (Fig. 4). A transthoracic echocardiogram displayed an ejection fraction of 60% with normal cardiac valves and normal left and right ventricular systolic function. An X-ray Panorex revealed several missing teeth, multilevel caries, significant maxillary and mandibular lamina propria resorption, periapical lucency involving the remaining right maxillary molar, and possible retention cyst/opacification of the left maxillary sinus. He was recommended outpatient follow-up in three weeks to fix his bad teeth. A repeat MRI pelvis with contrast revealed a marked interval decrease in size of the complex multiloculated abscess involving the right retroperitoneum, gluteal muscles, and right paraspinal muscles, abnormal marrow signal, and osseous erosion of the right ilium. He was discharged home on IV ceftriaxone 2 gm daily to complete six weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Four weeks later, he followed up at the ID clinic with a decline in inflammatory markers (Table 2), and he was transitioned to oral amoxicillin 875 mg thrice a day for the next 12 months. Repeat CT chest with contrast at eight weeks post-discharge revealed resolving right upper lobe consolidation with residual linear opacities. A repeat MRI pelvis with and without contrast 12 weeks after discharge revealed markedly improved osteitis of the right innominate bone, surrounding soft tissue infection, and minimal persistent marrow changes within the right iliac bone. At the ninth-month ID clinic follow-up, he had his teeth fixed, recovered weight loss, and resumed daily activities. He completed 12 months of oral amoxicillin with complete recovery. (Fig. 5).',\n",

The patient was transferred to the pediatric ward of our hospital with a provisional diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri.\\nThe patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain with Gadolinium which showed signs in keeping with longstanding raised ICP, including bilateral kinking of the optic nerves within the orbit, enlargement of subarachnoid spaces, flattening of the posterior sclera, and the empty sella sign [Figure 1b]. The same investigation documented a single, 16 mm, oval, T1 and T2 isointense, contrast-enhancing lesion arising in the right mastoid region, and narrowing the transverse-sigmoid sinus junction [Figure 2b].\\nA cerebral angiography digital subtraction angiography documented the compression of the right transverse-sigmoid junction distal to the vein of Labbe, within a picture of mild right side dominance of the venous sinuses circulation in the posterior fossa [Figure 2a]. A diagnosis of raised ICP related to impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption was supposed, considering the intracranial venous hypertension due to the lesion compressing the sinus. We decided to proceed with the surgical removal of the lesion.\\nThe tumor was approached through a right retrosigmoid incision. Intraoperatively, an osteolytic lesion was found on the asterion with a moderately bleeding core underneath, extending in the right mastoid. The lesion did not involve the dura and was indenting and stretching the right transverse sinus. We also considered the possibility to measure intraoperatively the hydrostatic pressure in the transverse sinus proximally to the lesion, but the potential risks related to a maneuver involving a puncture of the sinus outweighed the benefits. However, noticeably the previous proximal turgid sinus collapsed after the tumor excision.\\nThe removal was macroscopically complete, with immediate evidence of sinus decompression. The histological examination was in keeping with a diagnosis of osteoblastoma [Figure 3].\\nOn the postoperative time, a right mastoiditis occurred, which was successfully treated.\\nThe postoperative course was characterized by a prompt resolution of a headache and a progressive improvement of the visual acuity over the following weeks. Indeed, a 4-week follow-up ophthalmic exam documented a visual acuity of 7/10 in the right eye and 4/10 in the left, associated with a complete resolution of the papilledema and some degree of residual left optic atrophy.\\nA follow-up MRI after 4 months showed the normalization of the diameter of the right transverse-sigmoid junction [Figure 1a], and a significant regression of the signs of increased ICP [Figure 1c].',\n",

Those episodes involved choking, desaturation to 80%, as well as staring off with arms and legs outstretched. The patient was found to have Enterococcus UTI and MDR Serratia macescens and Stenotrophomon tracheitis, both of which were treated with a 10 day course of levofloxacin. Six days into admission, the patient continued experiencing multiple episodes of hypersomnolence and she had another seizure-like episode with eye deviation to the left. Patient was on an EEG at that time and was found to have no epileptiform activity. It was discovered that the patient was consistently hypoglycemic with blood glucose as low as 30 mg/dl. Patient was started on continuous feeds and D10 1/4 NS at 5 cc/hr. In addition, patient was given diazoxide 10mg/kg times two doses for concern of hyperinsulinemia. While receiving diazoxide, the patient experienced another episode of hypoglycemia of 41 mg/dl, which was noted after holding feeds for only 10 minutes. At that time, diazoxide was discontinued. On abdominal US, the pancreas was found to be normal, and insulin levels, drawn during hypoglycemic episodes while on diazoxide and after its discontinuation, were found to be within normal limits at 0.6 uIU/ml and <0.5 uIU/ml. Patient was discharged home on continuous feeds with q6h glucose checks and glucagon to be used as needed. At home the hypoglycemia symptoms have been well controlled with continues feeds; however, if the feeds are interrupted for more than 15 minutes the serum glucose level decreases to less 30 mg/dl.',\n",

Initially the patient's history was unremarkable, but during her second visit she acknowledged that for spiritual purposes she had been observing the sun with the naked eye regularly for many minutes over the past 8 years. Her uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA) was 0,9 in both eyes. A color fundus image disclosed a small round whitish discoloration in the fovea of both eyes (Figure 1 (Fig. 1)). A discrete discontinuity in the inner and outer segment junction (IS/OS), cone outer segment layer (COST), and retinal pigment epithelium layer (RPE) in the fovea of both eyes was noted on SD-OCT along with a streak of increased reflectivity in the choroid and sclera corresponding in size and location to the whitish discoloration on the color fundus image probably caused by focal RPE atrophy (Figure 2 (Fig. 2)). No changes were found on short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (SW-FAF) (Figure 3 (Fig. 3)). However, on near-infrared fundus autofluorescence (NIA) small spots of hypoautofluorescence in both maculae corresponding in location to the white discoloration in the color fundus image and the IS/OS to RPE layer retinal layer disruption on SD-OCT were found (Figure 4 (Fig. 4)).

Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) no past or current mental illness assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus: in particular, no major depression, dysthymia, mania or disinhibition based on DSM-V criteria; (2) no family history of mental illness or psychiatric hospitalization; (3) no history of head injury with loss of consciousness; (4) a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ( ) score of >=27; (5) no current pharmacological treatment, substance abuse or dependence that could substantially affect cognitive functioning.\\nAt the pre-scan evaluation, the young woman was alert, conscious and oriented in time and space. Production and comprehension of language were preserved. The neurological examination was negative. The psychological interview for inclusion in the normal control group highlighted normal mental status and psychological adjustment, intellectual and problem-solving ability, processing speed and executive functioning.\\nThe young woman1 had a normal postnatal developmental history and complete functional independence of long-living. She has reached the main milestones of young adulthood. Moreover, she denied any functional or social dysfunction in everyday life.\\nNeuroimaging data was acquired using a 3T Philips Ingenia scanner. Structural images were collected using T1-weighted (TR = 8.1 ms, TI = 900 ms, TE = 3.7 ms, voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm3) and axial T2-weighted FSE (TR = 3200 ms, TE = 100 ms, FOV = 432 x 432 mm, section thickness = 4 mm, acceleration factor = 2) sequences. The MRI showed no alterations of the brain parenchyma in the supra and infratentorial sites. Ventricles and sulci were of normal size and aligned. However, unexpected appreciable agenesis of the splenium of the corpus callosum was found ( Figure 1) with no alterations in the brain parenchyma signal in the supra and infratentorial sites.\\nIn view of such neuroimaging findings, YW was referred to the Neuroradiology Division in order to undergo a thorough neuropsychological evaluation ( ). The neurologist conducted a standardized interview with the patient on her health history before formalizing the diagnostic question to the neuropsychologist. The format of the health history is structured in order to organize patient information by following a written report for other health professionals. Subsequently, the neuropsychologist carried out a psychological anamnesis: it has the purpose of investigating aspects that serve to provide useful indications for the more possible precise psychological diagnosis. The complete interview is divided into the following topics: demographic data and marital status; physiological anamnesis; recent, near and remote anamnesis; functional anamnesis; psychological and psychopathological anamnesis; family history.\\nThe Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 4.0 (BPRS 4.0) was used to measure neuropsychiatric symptomatology ( ). Specific scales were employed to assess behavioral mood changes: the Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinician version (AES-C) ( ); the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDR-S) ( ); the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) ( ). The Self-Regulation Skills Interview (SRSI) ( ,  ), a clinical tool developed to measure higher levels of self-awareness and self-regulation skills that imply insight, motivation and compensation was also administered ( ).\\nThe Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) ( ) is one of the most widely used tools for measuring alexithymia. Alexithymia refers to individuals who are unable to identify and describe their emotions or have a tendency to minimize their emotional experience and to focus their attention externally. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The TAS-20 uses cut-off scoring: <=51 = non-alexithymia, >=61 = alexithymia.\\nThe Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) ( ) was administered to assess multiple aspects of emotion dysregulation. DERS is a 36-item, self-report questionnaire comprising six subscales developed to detect multiple aspects of emotion dysregulation: (1) Non-acceptance of emotional responses (Non-acceptance); (2) Difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior (Goals); (3) Impulse control difficulties (Impulse); (4) Lack of emotional awareness (Awareness); (5) Limited access to emotion regulation strategies (Strategies); (6) Lack of emotional clarity (Clarity) ( ). Recently,   provided equations to calculate age- and gender-adjusted T-scores, so that clinicians would easily interpret the resultant T-transformed DERS scores, which have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. DERS scores between 65 and 70 T should indicate the presence of difficulties in emotion regulation, whereas scores higher than 70 T indicate important problems in emotion regulation. DERS reported high alpha coefficients ranging from 0.80 to 0.89 for the different scales. Exploratory factor analysis was used to provide data on the factor structure of the DERS and identify the underlying dimensions of emotion regulation as assessed by this tool. We obtained T-transformed DERS scores. As mentioned before, DERS scores between 65 and 70 T indicate the presence of problems in emotion regulation and scores higher than 70 T indicate significant problems in emotion regulation.\\nIntelligence was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - IV edition (WAIS-IV) ( ). The pre-morbid intelligence quotient was estimated using the Brief Intelligence Test (TIB) ( ;  ) that is the Italian version of Nelson\\'s National Adult Reading Test ( ). Cognitive abilities were analyzed through a comprehensive battery of tests to measure ( ): attention through Attentional Matrices ( ); executive functions by means of Trial Making Test parts A, B ( ); memory through Wechsler Memory Scale -Subtests 4 and 7 ( ); language oral production by means of verbal fluency ( ). The absence of unilateral visual-attentional neglect was assessed by menas of the Bells Test ( ). Dysexecutive syndrome was assessed using ecological neuropsychological tasks created to simulate daily life situations: the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome test battery (BADS) ( ). Theory of Mind visual stories (ToM1 and ToM2) were used to test perspective-taking skills ( ), while the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task (RME) was used to measure social cognition and emotion recognition abilities ( ).

She underwent excisional surgery for the same 2 years before at a private dental clinic. Postsurgery within 6 months, the patient again noticed the swelling which gradually increased in size. The patient gave history of rapid increase in size since the preceding 6 months and spread toward the teeth of the left hand side of the mouth. Swelling was painless, but the patient complained that it interfered with chewing.\\nThere was no history of epilepsy or major illness. She was undergoing treatment for anemia with iron supplement. Developmental milestones and other systems of the child were normal. Family and menstrual history was noncontributary. The patient has unilateral mastication habit with left side since childhood. The right hand used for brushing.\\nGeneral physical evaluation was done. The patient had normal physical appearance and psychomotor skills. Normal bone development seen on the chest and extremity radiographs. The patient showed slight facial asymmetry with fullness of the right upper lip. The lips were competent [Figure 1].\\nGingival enlargement was more predominant on the right hand side of the mouth, but mild involvement was present extending to the incisors as well as the lingual aspect of the left mandibular molar region [Figures 2 and 3]. Only the maxillary left posterior teeth were completely uninvolved. Both facial and palatal/lingual aspects were involved in the maxillary and mandibular right hand side quadrants covering almost the entire clinical crown. There was diffuse involvement of marginal, papillary, and attached gingiva. The swelling was irregular, largely pale pink, and firm devoid of stippling along with softened reddish pink areas toward the occlusal surface associated with calculus deposits.\\nBleeding on probing was present with 14-16 regions. Several teeth were clinically submerged including the maxillary canines (13, 23) and mandibular left canine (33) and both the mandibular second premolars (35, 45). Even, the maxillary and mandibular second molar of the right hand side (17, 47) were clinically submerged. Deep pseudopockets along with attachment loss of up to 13-15 mm were present with 14, 15, 16, and 46 which showed Grade II mobility. Grade I mobility was present with 11, 12, 21, 22, 31, 32, 41-44.\\nOrthopantomogram (OPG) and three dimensional cone beam computed tomography evaluation was done. The radiographs revealed that the submerged teeth had bony impaction except for the maxillary and mandibular right second molars which appeared to be still erupting. Severe bone loss was present with 14, 15, and 16 teeth [Figure 4]. In this region, there was evidence of increased spacing and further bone loss compared to an OPG taken 3 years prior and the current radiograph. In addition, generalized crestal bone loss was present except with the left maxillary posterior teeth.\\nBlood investigations revealed the normal blood profile and hormonal levels. Hemoglobin level was low 10.3 mg%.\\nAfter obtaining written consent, thorough scaling, root planing, and curettage were done and anti-microbial rinse chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% prescribed and in addition used for irrigation of the pockets. This regime was repeated weekly for 3 weeks as it was difficult for the patient to maintain adequate plaque control. An incisional biopsy was done and 8 mm x 10 mm tissue specimen was sent for histopathological evaluation.\\nPostphase I appearance of the tissues showed overall superficial reduction in inflammation. Following this phase, electrosurgical gingivectomy was performed. First, the maxillary surgery was performed. After administering nerve block anesthesia to the patient, the area of tissue to be excised was demarcated with a probe. The electrosurgical unit (megasurg - high frequency radiosurgery unit) was set up and the passive electrode - the patient plate tied to the patient's calf. The needle electrode (active electrode) at 8 MHz was used to outline the external bevel incision. The tissues were further undermined with a bar electrode and removed in bulk. The bar electrode was then used to plane the tissues and achieve a favorable tissue contour. Following excision, thorough irrigation of the site was done. In some sites, additional curettage was done along and closure of the area with sutures. The operative procedures for Maxilla are shown in Figure 5. Periodontal dressing was placed, and the patient was prescribed anti-biotic and analgesic medication.\\nThe mandibular surgery was performed 2 weeks later similarly [Figure 6]. Postoperative healing a week later was satisfactory. The case was followed-up for 8 weeks postoperatively, and then every 3 months for 2 years. Favorable healing of the sites were seen postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months intervals. The mobility of teeth had significantly decreased from Grade II mobility to physiologic by 3 months postoperatively. The patient was able to maintain good oral hygiene. The patient has visited for recall follow-up since the past 2 years with minimal evidence of recurrence [Figure 7].\\nEvaluation was performed using routine H and E staining as well as polarized microscopy with specific connective tissue staining to verify the nature of the fibrosis. Abundant collagen with hyalinization of the collagen fibers was seen. Congested blood vessels with mixed inflammatory infiltrate focally transgressing the overlying epithelium were observed. There was no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy [Figure 8].\",\n",

At age four, both boys were diagnosed with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) by renal biopsy and were also noted to have tics, which were felt by their neurologist to be due to a forme fruste of Tourette syndrome. Developmentally, motor and cognitive milestones were slightly delayed, and both had dolichostenomelia with arm spans significantly greater than height. In addition, each had a high arched palate, joint laxity, pectus excavatum, mild scoliosis, and pes planus (flat feet). All of these physical findings suggested a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MS) (OMIM#154700). However, since the urologic, renal and developmental problems affecting the siblings are not typically seen in MS, and cardiac evaluations were normal, it was unclear which testing should be performed. At the time of this evaluation, Fibrillin 1 (FBN1) testing was not clinically available. Testing through our panel revealed that both patients carried one previously-reported missense variant in the coding region of the FBN1 gene (c.G4001A; p.G1334D; rs191989961), which produces a guanine-aspartate change and it is predicted as probably-pathogenic by our in silico analysis. This variant was previously reported in one other subject by the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine (Cambridge, MA) and deemed likely pathogenic based on their systematic approach for variant classification, which considers disease association from existing data, mechanism of gene function, and the use of several bioinformatic tools to predict the possible impact of the variant on the gene. MS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and since variants in FBN1 are also commonly associated with MS, we believe our findings may help explaining the boys' MS-like features. There were no variants identified in the FSGS-associated genes present in our panel, suggesting that additional testing is needed in these patients to determine the underlying molecular cause for their renal and urologic phenotype. Of note, if testing for these patients were to be performed clinically by Sanger sequencing or using a disease-specific gene panel, the costs associated would have been greater given that two separate testing for each phenotype would have been required.\",\n",

She had experienced episodes of palpitations and syncope related to exercise since 11 years of age. Due to intermittent prolongation of her QT interval on electrocardiography (ECG), she was given a provisional diagnosis of either Long QT syndrome (LQTS) or CPVT. These disorders have some overlapping features and both, if left untreated, may result in sudden death. However, because the treatment for various forms of LQTS and CPVT differ, determining the exact genetic variants is extremely helpful in managing patients. In addition, identifying the genetic variant can be life-saving for first degree relatives. Commercial testing is available for this specific phenotype but requires two separate sequencing panels (one for LQTS and one for CPVT) to differentiate the diagnosis. Because of lack of insurance and high cost, commercial testing was never performed. Based on the custom multi-disease gene panel that we designed, this patient was identified to be a compound heterozygote for variants in the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, identifying one novel stop variant (c.C199T, p.Gln67*) and one novel splice site variant (c.532+1G>A). Sanger sequencing confirmed the variants and in addition detected the presence of the p.Gln67* variant in the patient's child. The splice site variant was absent in the child, indicating that the mother's variants were in trans. Variants in CASQ2 account for 5-7% of all cases of CPVT, suggesting the most likely mode of inheritance to be autosomal recessive. Although the c.532+1G>A variant has not yet been demonstrated to alter mRNA splicing, we are conducting further functional work to determine how this variant affects splicing.\\nThe DNA from two sisters, TG471.001, TG471.002, presented to the Center for CardioGenetics with overlapping phenotypes of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), were sequenced and all cardiac related genes were analyzed. Several variants associated with cardiac disorders were detected, but only the LDB3 gene is directly associated with DCM (LIM domain-binding 3 gene LDB3; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated, 1C; OMIM#601493) and both sisters harbored the same missense variant (c.G352A, p.V118M; rs35507268). However, this exact LDB3 variant was also observed in the unaffected mother and upon further investigation categorized as likely benign by dbSNP, ClinVar, and HGMD. The other variants identified in the sisters were also identified in the unaffected family members, suggesting a lack of a clear pathogenic effect (see Fig 4 for mutational pedigree). Based upon this analysis, the true disease causing variants remain to be identified. We recommend whole exome sequencing be performed on this family in order to identify additional variants potentially associated with DCM. CNV analysis performed on the sisters did not identify variations suggestive of a potentially pathogenic nature.\\nPatient SS1, presenting with a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with conduction defects (OMIM#115200) harbored a 3.74 kb deletion that resulted in the heterozygous loss of the alpha-T-catenin gene (CTNNA3). This gene maps to chromosome 10q21.3, a region linked to autosomal dominant familial DCM. The most common form of myocardial disease, DCM is associated with a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, severe congestive heart failure and an increased risk of sudden death. CTNNA3 is highly expressed at intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes and peritubular myoid cells of the testis, indicating a specific function for this gene in particular muscle tissues. Several reports link variants in the CTNNA3 gene with another form of cardiomyopathy, specifically, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVC; OMIM#107970). Li et al. examined the role of CTNNA3 in the hearts of mice and found that CTNNA3 acts as a molecular integrator of adherens junctional and desmosomal components at the area composita resulting in early onset of DCM. This CNV is not common and to our knowledge has never been reported based on a literature search or inquiry of CNV databases. We propose the deletion may be causative of the patient's phenotype.\\nPatients TG90.001 and TG90.002 (CASES 1 and 2 above), both harbored two duplications mapping to regions 2q21.1 and 6q27, resulting in an allelic gain to eleven and four genes, respectively. Two genes, tubulin, alpha 3d (TUBA3D) located in the 2q21 region and kinesin family member 25 (KIF25) located in the 6q27 region are involved in microtubule formation. The copy number gain observed at 2q21 was maternally inherited, while the gain seen at 6q27 was paternally inherited. We suspect based on segregation analysis that these duplications, in addition to the potentially pathogenic variant identified in the FBN1 gene (previously discussed) could be responsible for the skeletal and muscular abnormalities observed in the twins, however in order to confirm this functional studies would need to be performed.\",\n",

Medical history showed that the patient had diarrhea that lasted for one week, without improvement even after 5 days of symptomatic treatment. There was no report of recent vaccinations or travel. Clinical examination showed diplopia and dysphonia with nasal speech. He did not present any muscular weakness or sensory loss, and osteotendinous reflexes were present and symmetrical. Cranial nerve examination did not show swallowing disorder, oculomotor disorder, or facial paralysis. The patient had no difficulty in walking, no pain or amyotrophy, no sphincter disorder, and no cauda equina syndrome. The plantar reflex was in flexion.\\nLaboratory tests were also normal. A brain CT with and without contrast was unremarkable.

The rabbit weighed 1.78 kg. Post mortem examination revealed a very firm, irregular mass with a smooth, gray/pink surface in the left abdomen. The mass had average dimensions 40 x 35 x 30 mm and had thin, tough, translucent adhesions to the left abdominal wall and the left uterine horn, the latter adhesion exhibiting evidence of vascularity, and the tension of the adhesion causing distortion of the left uterine horn (Figures 1A,B). On cut section, the mass was dry and multifocally gritty, but contained clearly discernable fetal remnants, including skin, hair, hard palate, and bone surrounded by lamellated fibrous tissue and fetal membranes (Figure 1C). The mass was interpreted to be a lithopedion, or mineralized abdominal ectopic pregnancy.\\nAt the point of attachment to the left uterine horn, the uterine lumen contained an irregular, cream, 12 x 8 x 5 mm concretion and a circumferential 10 mm band of the uterine endometrium was dark red at this focus. The right uterine horn contained two fetuses, with crown-rump lengths 55 and 53 mm. Macroscopically, the mammary gland exhibited some evidence of development consistent with early pregnancy, such as prominent vasculature and mild parenchymal development, but this was considered markedly less than expected for this stage of pregnancy based on previous analyses. The gastrointestinal tract, in particular the stomach, was subjectively less full than the majority of wild rabbits from the same region examined as part of ongoing studies and scarce fecal pellets were present in the rectum. No other abnormalities were detected macroscopically.\\nTissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and histological sections were prepared following standard procedures. The lithopedion was composed of amorphous eosinophilic material, indicative of degeneration and autolysis, which was multifocally heavily mineralized. Although nuclei were multifocally apparent, the degree of degeneration was such that cell populations were not identifiable and the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate could not be assessed. The uterus at the point of attachment of the lithopedion exhibited a locally extensive endometrial infiltrate of moderate numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, heterophils, and fewer macrophages, with locally extensive ulceration. Underlying this focus, there was a loss of distinction of the myometrial layers and locally extensive, mild to moderate, fibrosis. Together with the presence of the small concretion of mineralized material within the uterine lumen, this was considered strong evidence of abdominal pregnancy and formation of a lithopedion secondary to uterine rupture.',\n",

A CT scan showed a pancreatic head mass compressing the common bile duct. For palliation of hyperbilirubinemia, a palliative stent was placed in the common bile duct. A fine needle aspirate obtained through an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A follow-up CT scan performed on February 13, 2015 revealed a 3.6 x 2.7 cm pancreatic head mass that abutted the superior mesenteric artery and one of its proximal branches. There were suspicious peripancreatic and retroperitoneal nodes and no evidence of distant disease. At the beginning of March, she began taking 50,000 U vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily, ordered directly from the Internet and not under the direction of a healthcare practitioner. Repeat EUS and biopsy on March 3, 2015 again confirmed adenocarcinoma with papillary features. She was referred to an oncologist and surgeon for evaluation. A triple phase CT was done on March 16, 2015 that showed a stable mass without any evidence of involvement of the celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Upfront chemotherapy was recommended, with consideration of surgery in the future.\\nShe received gemcitabine/protein nanoparticle-bound paclitaxel in March. On day 10 of cycle 1, she developed neutropenic fever complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was intubated for a brief time who then recovered to her baseline functional status. She was discharged on April 19. Based on her frailty, she was deemed to be a poor candidate for surgery and chemotherapy was not resumed.\\nShe was referred to radiation oncology for consideration of stereotactic body radiotherapy, but she decided to first pursue alternative therapies. She visited an alternative care clinic in April and began taking chelodium, curcumin, community mushroom blend, viscosin, and naltrexone. She also continued to take her daily dose of 50,000 U vitamin D3. Although she was somewhat inconsistent in taking her regimen prescribed by the alternative therapy clinic, she consistently took the same vitamin D3 dose from April until the time of writing.\\nShe was seen first at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute in September 2015. On September 4, 2015, CT scan revealed the pancreatic head mass to be 3.1 x 3.0 cm, slightly smaller than previously with a mild increase in pancreatic duct dilatation. On our first visit on September 5, 2015, we did not obtain a full supplement history, but checked a vitamin D, 25 OH level, which surprisingly was elevated above normal value of >150 ng/mL. Her calcium level was 9.7, which had been 7.7 in March 2015, before starting supplementation. In October, 8 months after her only dose of chemotherapy, she had a CT scan that showed continued disease stability (Fig. 1). As of December 4, 2015, she was stable with no evidence of disease progression by both CT and CA 19-9 level. She was admitted to Fairfax hospital in October of 2015 for diverticulitis with abscess formation that was treated with resection.

She was admitted to the Surgery Department with acute abdominal pain. \\n There was no significant disease in her medical history but in her social history she had addiction to hookah. She was a pilotage student and was working several hours of a day in the airport. There was no history of drug consumption in the recent months to justify related abnormal liver function tests. \\n Location of pain was in epigastrium with radiation to the left lower quadrant area. The pain was persistent from 4 days ago, without relation to oral feeding. The patient had nausea and vomiting intermittently and also had anorexia but without significant weight loss. \\n The patient\\'s physical examination revealed stable hemodynamic, and mildly icteric sclera . In abdominal examination , tenderness of LLQ (left lower quadrant) in deep palpation without rigidity, or rebound tenderness was revealed. The other examinations such as chest and bowel sounds and also digital rectal examination were normal. \\n Laboratory findings included a normocytic anemia and direct bilirubinemia (table 1). \\n Plain abdominal radiography was normal. Ultrasound study of the abdomen and pelvis revealed several lymphadenopathies in the right lower quadrant and anterior to right psoas muscle. The biggest size of the lymph nodes was 14x7/5 mm. \\n Abdominal pain subsided with conservative management in the Emergency Surgery Department, and the patient was referred to gastroenterologists for more evaluations because of abnormal liver function tests. Other potential causes of icter and abnormal aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase including sepsis, viral hepatitis, autoimmune diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis were ruled out with proper laboratory and imaging modalities (table 1). \\n A new abdominopelvic sonography revealed normal liver and biliary tract except large amounts of sludge in the gallbladder. Gall bladder wall thickness was normal. Spleen, pancreas, retroperitoneum, and other abdominal organs were normal. Both kidneys and urinary bladder, uterus, and endometrium were normal. Ovaries size was 40x26 mm with several follicles (all<10 mm). There were five 11-13 mm adenopathies in the right lower quadrant. \\n Colonoscopy was normal until cecum. Terminal ileum was normal and biopsy of ileum revealed chronic inflammation, no villous atrophy, and no intraepithelial lymphocytosis. \\n According to hookah consumption and an unreliable history for addiction to opioids, serum lead level was examined to rule out lead poisoning. The serum lead level was 415/6 microg/L (41/5 microg/dL) with normal range of <150 microg/L, thus hematology and toxicology consult was performed. \\n Causes of anemia including iron deficiency and hemolytic anemia were excluded by checking serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), LDH(Lactate dehydrogenase), and reticulocyte count levels (table 1). \\n Morphology of RBC in peripheral blood smear showed anisocytosis(+), microcytosis(+), hypochromia(+), ovalocytosis(+), and ostomatocytosis (+). Basophilic stippling was also seen in the peripheral smear, which can be seen in lead poisoning (figure1). \\n Toxicology consult was done, and serum lead level was rechecked, which revealed 537 microg/L (53/7 mg/dL). Because of the serum lead level that was between 40 to 70 microg/dL and having considered the toxicology references  only oral chelator (succimer) was recommended for the patient.The recommended dose was 10 mg/kg three times a day for five days, followed by 10 mg/kg twice a day for two weeks (maximum 500 mg/dose). \\n Despite oral chelator consumption the pain continued, for which we decided to perform more evaluation for the patient. We found mild serum amylase and lipase elevation in the repeated lab tests (table 2). And according to the presence of sludge in the abdominal sonography of gallbladder, endosonography was done for more evaluation of common bile duct (CBD). The report read :\"there were multiple hyperechoic lesions and one small stone with posterior shadow inside the distal part of CBD. Diameter of CBD was 3/6 mm. pancreas was normal. Gall bladder had multiple small hyperechoic lesions\". \\n Because of these findings and the presence of severe abdominal pain, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was done. ERCP revealed no dilation of CBD, so sphincterotomy was done and sludges were extracted. \\n Despite these therapeutic managements, the abdominal pain deteriorated during the admission, and gradually did not respond to ordinary analgesics, and only opioid analgesics could relief the pain in the last nights of admission in the GI ward. Surgical consultation was done, by which laparoscopy was recommended to approach to the unknown origin of continuous pain and also to the lymphadenopathies, which were noted in the abdominal sonographies. The patient underwent laparascopy. Its report read: \"small intestine from proximal to distal was investigated which was normal but some lymphadenopathies was seen in the mesenter. Stomach, liver, uterus, ovaries, were normal.Cholecystectomy was done and biopsies obtained from the lymphnodes, liver and peritoneum.\" Pathological evaluation of the specimens revealed :1-cholecystectomy: acute on chronic cholecystitis, 2-mesenteric lymph node: reactive, 3- wedge liver biopsy: without significant pathologic changes, 4-labeled as peritoneal biopsy: fibromuscular tissue. \\n Conservative management was done after surgery, but the pain continued. Because of the patient\\'s job in the airport, consultation with occupational medicine specialist was done, who recommended re-evaluation for lead poisoning considering her work place that is a source of environmental lead poisoning and also history of substance abuse (hookah addiction) and unreliable history for probably opioid addiction. Therefore the patient was admitted to toxicology ward. \\n At the toxicology ward, BLL was rechecked, which was 54 microg/dL. Because of no response to previous oral chelator therapy in the same BLL, and the severe suspicious to lead poisoning as the cause of the abdominal pain, intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) chelator therapy were recommended. \\n Dimercaprol or BAL (also referred to as British antilewisite) in conjunction with calcium EDTA was started for the patient. The recommended dose for BAL was 4 mg/kg to be injected deep IM every 4 hours for 3 days, in conjunction with edetate calcium disodium with the second dimercaprol dose; 25-50 mg/kg/day, IV for 5 days. A maximum dose of 3000 mg was considered for calcium EDTA. After 3 days of the treatment, clinical findings including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain subsided and finally the pain relieved dramatically. The patient was discharged after 5days of BAL prescription with maintenance therapy with oral succimer (10 mg/kg twice a day for two weeks). \\n The patient was recommended to avoid substance abuse (hookah consumption), and also she was referred to occupational and environmental medicine specialists to evaluate the relationship between lead toxicity and her working environment. She was visited again 10 days later. There was no icterus, pain, or new signs or symptoms. New laboratory findings were all in normal range. She was recommended for monthly follow-up visits for six months (table 2).',\n",

Eight years ago, the patient was diagnosed with esophageal achalasia, and balloon dilation was performed several times in a previous hospital, but it was not effective. Endoscopic findings before POEM showed a narrow esophagus in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) region and severe circumferential esophagitis in the esophageal body due to stasis. In addition, there was a slightly depressed, reddish lesion suspected to be cancerous in the mid-thoracic esophagus. Histological diagnosis of the biopsy specimen prior to POEM was esophagitis (non-cancerous part) (Fig. 1A). However, early esophageal cancer was highly suspected. We expected secure diagnosis of the lesion by reducing the inflammation of esophageal mucosa by the POEM procedure. Thus, we performed myotomy from the distal side of the lesion, and the patient planned to undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedure after POEM. We selected a posterior method for POEM, as there was severe scarring on anterior wall in the lower esophagus. During the POEM procedure, it was very difficult to create the submucosal tunnel because the mucosa adhered to the muscles (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we inserted an endoscope into the extraesophageal space through a tear in the musculature (Fig. 1C). Both the inner circular muscle and longitudinal muscles were pulled and divided carefully using a Triangle Tip knife to prevent mucosal damage outside of the esophagus (Fig. 1D). The total length of myotomy was 8 cm (the gastric side was 1 cm).\\nAfter POEM, LES opened and patient's dysphagia improved. Endoscopic findings 3 months after POEM showed that the esophagitis had improved to mild. The reddish lesion in mid-thoracic esophagus was histologically diagnosed as cancer by repeat biopsy at that time. Intra-mucosal cancer was suspected based on the endoscopic appearance. It is difficult to take specimens by ESD for accurate pathological diagnosis when there is severe fibrosis in the submucosal space. As this was revealed in our patient during the POEM procedure, the patient instead underwent an esophagectomy (after informed consent). There were two main histological findings: first, intramucosal cancer; and second, the muscle tissue that had been divided by the POEM procedure was replaced with fibrotic tissue (Fig. 2 A,B,C,D).\",\n",

The patient underwent right side transurethral lithotripsy (TUL) and left open ureterolithotomy through the Gibson incision to remove the giant uretric calculus. Longitudinal incision was performed on the ureteral wall to remove the stone from the left ureter and the stone was extracted with difficulty due to its angle and impaction to the ureteral wall. Thereafter, the distal part of the left ureter was resected due to distal stenosis and then uretroscopy was performed through the resected ureter with advancement to the proximal part of the ureter; as we reached to the renal pelvis stone, it was fragmented. In fact, the retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) was performed for three main goals: reducing the bulk of the stone, applying ureteral stents to ensure the patency of the ureter and facilitating percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for the next surgery.\\nTwo weeks after the first surgery, in the second session, PCNL was conducted to remove the remaining kidney stones and then the patient was transferred to the ward for subsequent observation and management.

In anamnesis, the patient described that he had suffered a trauma in an anterior-superior direction due to an accidental impact. The patient kept the teeth stored in dry media for 40 minutes, and an open apex was observed. The replantation procedure was made according to the International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) guidelines. The adopted protocol was the recommended for avulsed teeth with open apex and stored dry less than 60 minutes, and consisted of: roof surface and apical foramen cleaning with saline solution; local anaesthesia; alveolar socket evaluation for alveolar fracture (in the reported case it was not present); clot removal and gentle tooth replantation; no suture was necessary due to lacerations; removal of occlusal trauma; flexible splitting (for two weeks); systemic antibiotics; and antitetanic vaccination.\\nThe immediate post-operative period was uneventful (Figure 1a). At six-month follow-up, there were no signs of necrosis or mobility; however, the patient disappeared and returned to our service after five years (Figure 1b).\\nAt a five-year post-trauma evaluation, total apexification, complete PCC and yellow discoloration of the dental crown were observed in both central incisors, with an inconclusive response to pulp tests (Figure 1c). There were no signs of root resorption or pulp necrosis. After two years, tooth 11 showed a widening of the periodontal ligament space with occlusal trauma. At this moment, the probable cause was eliminated and the treatment chosen was the observation. However, at eight years post-trauma, a radiographically visible apical lesion was diagnosed, and the tooth did not respond to pulp tests and had light sensitivity to percussion (Figure 2a). Left central incisor 21 showed no lesion, symptomatology or signs of pulp necrosis.\\nAlthough radiography showed complete PCC, this exam is not the gold standard. A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the indicated exam to evaluate anatomy of the pulp canal and degree of calcification in detail. However, the CBCT exam was not available in our public service. At this moment, there were two treatment plans: to perform a conventional endodontic treatment or to perform a periapical surgery. Faced with the difficulty of executing conventional endodontic treatment due to the extreme calcification of the root canal and the risk of perforation and/or incomplete endodontic treatment, the clinical treatment plan established was periapical surgery and apical root sealing with MTA-based (MTA, Angelus, Londrina, PR, Brazil) endodontic cement. Also, any marginal bone loss due to perforation would have compromised the tooth because of the reduced root height. The patient was informed about the treatment plan and consented to undergo it.\\nThe surgical procedure was performed under local anaesthesia using mepivacaine 3% with epinephrine 1:100,000. An intrasulcular trapezoidal incision was performed to provide an adequate surgical field and access to the apical area. The flap was reflected and spherical burs #5 (Microdent, Sao Paulo, Brazil) were used to cut and scrape the bone to access the root apical area of tooth 11 (Figure 2b). Periapical curettage was performed in order to remove granulation tissue (Figures 2bd). Due to the decreased length of the root, only a slight apical wear was performed. To prevent root perforation, preparation and regularisation of the apical cavity were performed until intracanal resistance was felt. Therefore, the preparation was limited to the apical third. Retrograde filling was done with MTA.\\nThe mucoperiosteal flap was sutured in position, and a periapical radiograph was taken to confirm the accuracy of the retrograde filling of tooth 11. The post-operative period was uneventful, and the lesion was diagnosed as apical granuloma. In the six-month follow-up, a periapical radiograph showed a slight radiolucency consistent with scar tissue (Figure 3a). At 53 months, no apical lesions, root resorption or bone loss were observed (Figure 3b). In this case report, the periapical surgery was successful. The sensibility disappeared, the lesion decreased and the patient had no complaint. The intraoral evaluation presented periodontal health without mobility or any signs of infection.',\n",

The patient was then started on chemotherapy 14 days later with paclitaxel. During chemotherapy, the patient developed a swelling of the gums which was symptomatic and hence was referred to the Periodontics department for further management. The swelling occurred 9 months after the initial breast swelling was noticed.\\nOn intra-oral clinical examination, a dumbbell-shaped swelling of the gums was seen extending from the buccal aspect through the interdental space to the palatal aspect in the upper maxillary teeth (between 11 and 21). The swelling on the buccal aspect appeared smooth and shiny, while the palatal swelling had a more irregular surface. The swelling was reddish pink in color. The dimension of the buccal swelling was 16 mm x 11 mm and the palatal swelling was 13 x 12 mm approximately (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The patient reported that the swelling was initially small and grew at a rapid rate to the current size within a span of 2 weeks, causing an increase in space between the central incisors. The patient also had a history of occasional pain and bleeding from the palatal side of the swelling. Plaque and calculus deposits were present with generalized gingival inflammation. On general examination, the patient presented with cancer cell deposits, presenting as a painless nodular swelling with a central necrotic crust on the tip of the middle finger of the right hand involving the fingernail, chin, scalp, and the upper arm (Figure 2).\\nRadiographic analysis was done to check for bony involvement and periapical radiographs showed bone loss extending beyond the middle third of the root in relation to 11 and 21. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) evaluation revealed that the height of maximum bone loss in the mid-alveolus region of 11 and 21 measured about 10.80 mm (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). A panoramic radiograph was also taken to rule out the presence of other lytic bony lesions involving the jaw bones. Prior to surgery, routine hematological investigations were done and the reports showed that the blood parameters were just above the normal range.\\nA wide excision of the lesion was planned to remove the entire swelling with a 2 mm margin of healthy tissue using a 15c blade. On the removal of the lesion, the exposed underlying bone showed a moth-eaten appearance, which is characteristic of lytic lesions of the bone (Figure 3). The large defect was sealed with a gelatin sponge, sutures were given, and a periodontal dressing was placed to shield the surgical site. The patient was prescribed antibiotics and analgesics. Post-operative review after 3 months revealed satisfactory healing of the wound.\\nHistopathology of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained soft tissue section showed an atrophic ulcerated stratified squamous epithelium in association with a fibrovascular connective tissue. The connective tissue showed infiltrating solid islands of malignant epithelial tumour cells arranged in groups and clusters. The tumour cells were polygonal with eosinophilic cytoplasm and open-faced nuclei. Cells have pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei. The tumour cells showed numerous mitotic figures. Some of the dysplastic islands showed central necrosis resembling comedonecrosis. Focal areas of the tumour cells showed cytoplasmic clearing. The associated connective tissue was fibrovascular and scanty. The histopathological features were suggestive of infiltrating poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Figure 4). The tissue specimens were sent for immunohistochemistry (IHC) for confirmatory diagnosis. IHC evaluation showed that tumour cells were positive for cytokeratin (Pan CK) and specifically for CK7 while showing negative results for oestrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2, GATA binding protein (GATA) 3, and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)1.\\nAfter excision of the gingival enlargement, a PET scan was done which revealed extensive Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid metastases in the brain, lung, liver, pancreas, nodes, subcutaneous and intramuscular soft tissue nodules, and sacrum (Figure 5). FDG avid lesions in both breasts were also seen. Compared with the previous PET-CT, the reports suggested progression of the disease. The patient was started on chemotherapy:Eribulin in view of disease progression. Unfortunately, fourteen months after the detection of the primary breast cancer tumour the patient passed away.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"An 84-year-old patient with a history of Parkinson's disease was admitted to the cardiology ward because of chest pain. The day after admission, the patient complained of shaking limbs, for which the neurologist was consulted. Neurologic examination showed a pronounced negative myoclonus (Video 1). Laboratory examination including electrolytes, liver and renal function, thyroid function, glucose, and arterial blood gas was performed, showing no abnormalities. The patient had been using ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for 5 days for a urinary tract infection. The ciprofloxacin was discontinued after which the negative myoclonus disappeared within 1 day.\\nNegative myoclonus is characterized by a brief sudden loss of muscle activity in agonist muscles followed by a compensatory jerk of the antagonistic muscles, appearing as involuntary jerky movements. Negative myoclonus may be of cortical or subcortical origin. Cortical negative myoclonus may be caused by epilepsy syndromes and a variety of acquired factors, such as focal brain lesions. Subcortical myoclonus occurs mainly in toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, caused by electrolyte disturbances, liver and respiratory failure or several drugs. To our knowledge, negative myoclonus has not been previously described in association with the use of ciprofloxacin. However, several neurotoxic effects have been associated with the use of quinolones, including seizures, extrapyramidal manifestations, and positive myoclonus. The hypothesized mechanism of the neurotoxicity is inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA-A) receptors and activation of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, leading to a toxic encephalopathy. Patients with prior central nervous system disease, such as Parkinson's disease, impaired renal function, and advanced age may be particularly vulnerable.\\nIn patients with negative myoclonus, laboratory examination and medication evaluation should be performed to identify the underlying cause. The differential diagnosis of negative myoclonus includes positive myoclonus and tremor. Electrophysiology can assist with determining this; however, this was not performed in our patient. The treatment includes correction of electrolyte disturbances or, like in our case, cessation of the provocative drug. If the negative myoclonus persists, neuro-imaging and/or emergent EEG may be useful to analyze other causes. If necessary, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam or anti-epileptic drugs can be administered to suppress the symptoms.\",\n",

She was treated for fever and cough before hospitalization. While her fever abated immediately, she had balance problems in walking and standing. Her past medical history was uneventful and there was no family history of optic neuritis, myelitis or NMOSD. She was alert and had no abnormal physical findings. On neurological examination, there was no weakness in muscles and no sensory disturbance, but she had uncoordinated movement in her both lower limbs in performing heel-knee test, and her gait was wide-based, and could not perform a tandem gait test. Neuropsychological examination revealed signs of the following corpus callosal disconnection syndromes: diagonistic apraxia, tactile anomia in the left hand, crossed tactile disorientation, crossed optic ataxia, alexia of the left visual field, auditory extinction of the left ear.\\nWith diagonistic apraxia, she experienced bizarre movements in her left hand while changing her clothes and having meals. When taking a meal, her left hand involuntarily grabbed her rice bowl, while her right hand was selecting and picking food from a dish with chopsticks. The errant hand came under control when reprimanded verbally.\\nIn laboratory testing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated 30 mm/1 h and 48 mm/2 h. Anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4), Anti-Sjogren's syndrome-related antigen A (anti-SS-A), anti-SS-B, and anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae-IgM antibodies were positive. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were lymphocytosis (9/muL), elevated protein content of 52 mg/dL, elevated myelin basic protein level of 1221.5 pg/mL (normal <102 pg/ml) and elevated IgG index of 0.9 (normal <0.8). The oligoclonal bands were negative. Her chest X-ray and CT examinations were normal.\\nBrain MRI showed high-signal intensities of the entire corpus callosum from genu to splenium (Figures 1A,B). The lesions on the corpus callosum were a mixture of patchy low and high-intensity signals. She had prodromal infection, elevation of cells and myelin basic protein in cerebrospinal fluid, and lesions in the corpus callosum on brain MRI. Multiple sclerosis, NMOSD, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion due to mycoplasma infection or vasculitis were considered as differential diagnoses. Because Anti-AQP4, anti-SS-A, and anti-SS-B antigens were positive and salivary gland biopsy revealed inflammatory cell infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells, the patient was diagnosed with anti-AQP4-seropositive NMOSD with SS.\\nAfter intravenous steroid pulse therapy (1,000 mg of methylprednisolone for 3 days) was performed twice and the following symptoms improved; ataxia of the legs, unsteadiness in standing and walking, callosal disconnection syndromes such as left-hand diagonistic apraxia, left hand tactile anomia, crossed tactile disorientation, crossed optic ataxia, and left-visual field alexia. However, the patient's corpus callosum lesion was still edematous on MRI, and auditory extinction of left ear remained. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was begun on day 21 for 5 days but changed little. She was discharged on day 40 with subsequent treatment of tapered prednisolone at 40 mg/day. Azathioprine 100 mg was also added. One year later the left-field alexia disappeared. A mottled signal inside the corpus callosum also remained (Figures 1C,D).\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 69-year-old male patient presents with a chief complaint of neck pain of several weeks, radiating to the head and right shoulder. The pain is reported to be intermittent, burning in quality, associated with weakness and numbness especially in the right hand. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, DVT/pulmonary embolus in the past year for which he is on anticoagulant therapy, and a surgical history of bilateral knee replacement within the past two years. The patient has no history of neurofibromatosis or stigmata of another genetic disorder. Upon physical examination, the patient has right hemiparesis (-4/5) that has mildly progressed compared to prior examination. MRI of the cervical spine (performed at an outside institution) reveals a T1 hypointense and T2 heterogeneously hyperintense extramedullary mass causing impingement upon the right side of the spinal cord which is flattened and displayed to the left at the C2-C3 level. The mass measures approximately 35 mm in transverse diameter by 13 mm in AP diameter by 18 mm in craniocaudal diameter and laterally extends through the right C2-C3 neural foramen. The radiologic impression is that of a nerve sheath tumor of either benign or malignant nature (no images available). Surgery is recommended, and the patient undergoes a C2-C3 laminectomy at an outside institution with resection of the tumor. Intraoperatively, the tumor is seen on the right side of the canal with the cord. Dorsolaterally, the tumor appears to blend in with the dura at its base. The junction is coagulated with bipolar cautery. Then, some of the tumor is debulked along the base, allowing it to shrink away from the cord laterally. Working around the superior pole of the tumor then reveals rootlets that appear to be joining the tumor to the right superior pole along its posterior aspect. Attempting to dissect to release it reveals that the rootlets were not just adherent to the capsule but rather growing into the tumor. The rootlets are hence cauterized and amputated at base. The tumor is removed in piecemeal fashion, and the tissue is sent to pathology. Grossly, the specimen consists of multiple pieces of light tan, firm tissue measuring in aggregate (2.0 x 1.6 x 0.3 cm).\\nThe slides are sent to our institution for review. Microscopic examination reveals fragments of a benign nerve sheath tumor comprised of Schwannian cells arranged in loose fascicles set in an eosinophilic stroma with occasional hyalinized vessels and Verocay bodies, compatible with Schwannoma (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Also present was a small separate fibrous fragment with psammomatous calcifications and vaguely nested bland spindled to ovoid cells with focal crush artifact (Figure 2(a)). No necrosis or mitotic figures are identified. Immunohistochemical stains are performed and show that the tumor cells are diffusely positive for S100 and SOX-10 in the Schwannoma component (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). The small fibrous fragment, on the other hand, is negative for SOX-10 (Figure 2(b)) and shows weak staining for S100 while PR and CD34 show patchy weak staining and EMA and SSTR2A are positive (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)) thus compatible with a meningothelial origin. HMB-45, Melan A, and STAT6 are negative.\\nThe overall histopathological and immunohistochemical findings are compatible with Schwannoma with a small focus of benign meningothelial proliferation compatible with benign meningothelial hyperplasia. MRI with and without contrast performed three months after the surgery shows postoperative changes of subtotal resection of the enhancing mass centered about the right C2-C3 foramen, with a residual 21 x 10 x 16 mm (axial long axis x axial short axis x craniocaudal) right neural foraminal mass and significant improvement in the spinal cord compression. At six month postsurgery, MRI demonstrates improved postsurgical changes with redemonstration of the residual spinal enhancing mass at the right C2-C3 neural foramen extending into the spinal canal with minimal mass effect on the spinal cord on the right aspect of the cord at this level. No further available clinical data could be obtained due to the patient being lost to follow-up.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 28-year-old pregnant woman, 12 gestational weeks in July 2019, attracted our attention for recurrent abortions, as well as being strongly positive of anti-SSA /Ro and antinuclear antibodies, suspected fetal autoimmune associated AVB without cardiac structural abnormality.\\nThe first pregnancy of this woman was in March 2017 but it resulted in a spontaneous abortion at 50+ days of pregnancy. Her second pregnancy in February 2018 was a biochemical pregnancy. Subsequently, a thyroid function test suggested hypothyroidism and was successfully treated by oral thyroxine. Whereas, strongly positive antinuclear antibody (granular type) with a titer of 1:1,000 (normal reference value is negative) and anti-SSA/Ro antibody with a quantitative >400 RU/ml (normal reference range 0 to <20 RU/ml) of the patient was revealed and was diagnosed of undifferentiated connective tissue disease by entomologist, and was given hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice a day), tacrolimus (500 mg, twice a day), and low-dose methylprednisolone (4 mg, once a day). Except for repeated abortions, the patient had not complained of photosensitive rash, thrombosis, joint pain, and arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, xerophthalmia, or xerostomia.\\nThe patient was pregnant the third time in July 2019, and the re-examination of autoantibodies revealed antinuclear antibody-positive (particle type) with a titer of 1:320; anti-SSA/Ro antibody-positive with a quantitative >400 RU/ml. As the pregnancy progressed, monitoring the patient's serum antibody revealed that the anti-Sm antibody gradually became positive (>400 RU/ml, the normal reference range 0 to <20 RU/ml), but there was still no clinical sign of connective tissue disease. Hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice a day), tacrolimus (500 mg, twice a day), and low-dose methylprednisolone (4 mg, once a day) continued.\\nThe patient was transferred to our hospital due to recurrent abortion and undifferentiated connective tissue disease by a local obstetrician and endocrinologist. Considering that the first two pregnancies of the patient were both early miscarriages, it is still uncertain whether there exited fetal immune heart injury in the first two pregnancies, and they might be probands of fetal immune heart damage to this pregnancy. Existing epidemiological studies suggest that the risk of fetal AVB will be significantly increased in a pregnancy with a previously affected fetus or neonate, and the role of fetal genetic susceptibility in the development of autoimmune:associated fetal AVB cannot be ignored. Therefore, we classified this pregnancy as a high-risk pregnancy of cardiac immune attack. During the whole pregnancy, the fetal AV interval and maternal serum autoantibody titers were regularly monitored. The mother was generally in good physical condition during pregnancy and no abnormal findings in the ECG and echocardiogram examinations.\\nAt 12 weeks of gestation, we monitored the fetal echocardiogram and found that there exited strong light points about 2 mm in diameter in the left ventricular, as well as enhanced endocardial echo image, which indicated that the fetal heart might exit a certain degree of immune injury. At the same time, the fetal echocardiogram monitoring indicated that the AV interval was within the normal range (104-112 ms). Considering the relatively high incidence of fetal heart immune-mediated cardiac conduction injury in pregnancies that suffer from immune-mediated fetal congenital heart block, avoiding the occurrence of miscarriage or stillbirth, and potential fetal AVB, dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were treatment options according to the treatment regimens reported in previous literature.\\nAfter fully understanding the advantages and disadvantages of dexamethasone and IVIG, the patient determined to adopt IVIG treatment (Chengdu Rongsheng Pharmaceutical Co., LTD., 2.5 g, 50 ml/bottle). According to the characteristics of IVIG, and the reported usage in the literature, the patient received IVIG 1 g/kg twice a week at 12 and 13-week of pregnancy, respectively. Encouragingly, in a reexamination of the fetal echocardiogram, the enhanced echoes and endocardial echo enhancement of the left ventricle gradually disappeared, and the AV interval was normal without a tendency of prolongation. Meanwhile, the maternal serum antibody titers showed a downward trend after receiving IVIG (Table 1).\\nThen, the frequency of IVIG treatment was adjusted to once every 2 weeks, 1 month later, regarding fetal stable condition, and then adjusted once a month. However, at 25 + 6 weeks of gestation, a gradual prolongation of the AV interval was observed, increasing from 106 ms to 130-140 ms. Although the AV interval was still within the normal range, the rapidly extending within 1 week was urgent. In order to avoid progressive prolongation of the fetal AV interval, we upregulated the frequency of IVIG treatment to once every 3 weeks based on the half-life of immunoglobulin in human circulation (21 days). After adjusting the frequency of IVIG treatment, the AV interval of the fetal heart gradually returned to the previous condition. The last IVIG dosage was given at 33 + 6 GW. The fetal condition during pregnancy and maternal serum antibody level are shown in Table 1, and the use of IVIG is shown in Figure 1.\\nFetal echocardiography was regularly performed until successful delivery, and there were no signs of fetal arrhythmia and/or cardiac malformations. Cesarean section was performed at 39 weeks of gestation and a male newborn was born with a birth weight of 2,940 g. The amniotic fluid was clear at birth, the Apgar score was 10 points, and there were no abnormalities in the placenta or expectation.\\nThe newborn underwent a comprehensive physical examination after delivery and received blood routine tests, thyroid function tests, and echocardiography examination 3 days after being born, all showed within normal range. The electrocardiogram of the newborns was also performed on the first day after birth, and the results were normal with a PR interval of 104 ms, as well as the Holter monitoring. Meanwhile, the serum autoantibody examination of the baby showed positive results of anti-Sm antibodies (quantitative >400 RU/ml), anti-SSA/Ro antibodies (quantitative 148.7 RU/ml), and antinuclear antibodies (titer 1:100).\\nAt 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 18-month follow-ups, the growth and development, ECG, and echocardiography of the baby were normal. Additionally, all the serum antibody titers also turned negative at 3- or 6-month of follow-up (Table 2).\\nDuring the post-partum period, the mother remained asymptomatic and showed no signs of aggravation of the disease. The monitoring of maternal serum autoantibody level within 6-month follow-up indicated a gradual decline. While the recent laboratory tests showed that anti-Sm antibodies with quantitative >400 RU/ml, anti-SSA /Ro antibodies with quantitative 282.2 RU/ml, and antinuclear antibodies with titrum 1:320.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'In January 2013, a 65-year-old male presented to Korea University Anam Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea), with an intra-abdominal mass that was localized to the right side. The mass had presented one month previously. In addition, the patient had experienced weight loss (5 kg) during the previous four months. The medical history was unremarkable, with the exception of pulmonary tuberculosis 30 years previously, from which the patient had recovered. On physical examination, a round mass was palpated and there was tenderness of the right upper quadrant area. Hematological examination revealed a marginal decrease of hematocrit (35.8%; normal range, 37-51%) and hemoglobin (11.8 g/dl; normal range, 12.6-17.4 g/dl). Liver function tests revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase (423 IU/l; normal range, 30-120 IU/l) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (587 IU/l; normal range, 9-64 IU/l) levels. Aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels were within the normal ranges of 3-45 IU/l, 3-45 IU/l and 0.0-0.4 mg/dl, respectively. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a subepithelial mass with a fistulous hole on the second portion of the duodenum (Fig. 1). A total colonoscopy revealed no abnormalities. A computed tomography (CT) scan, which was acquired from the referring local clinic (Choi Kang Sik Internal Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea), demonstrated a large, heterogeneously enhanced lobulated mass (11.5x9.3 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) with internal necrosis at the pancreaticoduodenal groove (Fig. 2A). The internal cavity of the mass was connected to the second portion of the duodenum, which was consistent with the endoscopic findings. Furthermore, an ill-defined low-attenuation lesion was identified at segment eight of the liver, abutting the bile duct and hepatic artery (Fig. 2B). Significantly enlarged lymph nodes were not observed in the abdominal cavity. In addition, a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan also revealed hypermetabolic masses in the duodenal groove and in segment eight of the liver, which was consistent with the CT scan. Abdominal MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) was also conducted for further characterization of the duodenal and hepatic masses observed on the CT scan, which confirmed the same findings. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the duodenal mass was performed and pathological examination identified whirling sheets of spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 3A). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for c-Kit, but negative for cluster of differentiation 34, S-100 and desmin (Fig. 3B). Mitotic features could not be evaluated, as a surgically excised sample was not obtained. The diagnosis of high-risk GIST with hepatic metastasis was determined and the patient was treated with 400 mg imatinib, daily. The treatment was tolerated well, and the abdominal mass and distension improved significantly. After seven weeks of treatment, the follow-up abdominal CT scan revealed that the duodenal mass had significantly reduced in size (7.9x6.5 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) and exhibited an increased area of internal necrosis. However, the hepatic mass had increased from 1.7x1.5 cm to 3.9x3.2 cm in diameter (longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) and the right hepatic duct was markedly dilated by the mass (Fig. 4). Various enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the left gastric area, including the porta hepatis and portocaval space. The ultrasound-guided needle biopsy was repeated for the hepatic mass and histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed malignant cells with a glandular structure, which was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis exhibited c-Kit-negative and cytokeratin 19-positive staining (Fig. 5). The final diagnosis was synchronous ICC and GIST. Two weeks after the ultrasound-guided liver biopsy, the patient developed jaundice and a fever, and the total level of bilirubin increased rapidly to 9.4 mg/dl (normal range, 0.0-0.4 mg/dl). Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was conducted along with antibiotic treatment and administration of imatinib was withheld to allow the patient to recover from the condition. An abdominal CT scan following three weeks of conservative treatment revealed an increase in size of the liver mass (5.3x3.9 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter) with portal vein thrombosis, and the size of the duodenal mass had also increased to 9.5x8.7 cm (longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter). The treatment regimen became focused towards the ICC, which was associated with a poorer prognosis. Due to the well-known toxicity of combined chemotherapy, administration of imatinib was terminated and the patient was treated with intravenous gemcitabine (100 mg/m2 for 30 min, days 1 and 8) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2 for 1 h, days 1 and 8) every three weeks for four cycles. During chemotherapy, the abdominal mass reappeared, as a follow-up CT scan, performed six weeks following treatment, revealed a prominent increase in the size of the duodenal mass (10.7x10 cm; longest diameter x greatest perpendicular diameter). However, the hepatic mass did not demonstrate a significant change in size during that interval. As the patient had tolerated the initial chemotherapy well, combined chemotherapy (consisting of imatinib, gemcitabine and cisplatin) was initiated for symptom control and treatment of the GIST. The addition of imatinib resulted in the duodenal mass decreasing significantly and the patient exhibited a good response to the treatment. However, certain toxicities are associated with combined chemotherapy, such as grade 1 bone marrow suppression, as observed in the present case. The follow-up CT scan revealed disease progression of the ICC, whereas the size of the GIST mass had decreased. The treatment modality was altered, due to refractory cholangiocarcinoma, from chemotherapy to radiation therapy (daily dose of 180 Gy), whilst maintaining the imatinib treatment. To date, the patient has been undergoing treatment for one year and is tolerating the treatment well.',\n",

His postoperative regular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) examinations showed no obvious abnormalities. Two years later (on October 12, 2019), the patient started to experience headache, blurred vision, and hearing loss. On October 31, 2019, his brain MRI exam showed multiple brain masses including multiple metastases in the lateral ventricle, right frontal lobe, and cerebellar hemisphere ( Figure 2A ). His genetic testing revealed the L858R mutation in exon 21 of EGFR. His positron emission tomography (PET) CT scan suggested bone metastasis ( Figure S1 ). The patient was then treated with osimertinib (80 mg oral administration daily), bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg q3w), and bisphosphonate (4mg q3w). After treatment for 1 month, his symptom of headache almost disappeared, but he developed blurred vision and unstable walking on both feet. On 2020-1-4, the patient complained increased blurred vision and occasional headache. On 2020-4-21, his brain MRI ( Figure 2B ) showed multiple dot-line enhancements (masses) in the cerebellar sulci, suggesting meningeal metastasis. On 2020-4-30, the patient underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology examination and cancer cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid, which was in line with the characteristics of adenocarcinoma cells ( Figure 2C ). His CSF genetic testing results in May 2020 showed that mutations were EGFR p.L858R, TP53 p.R273C and ERBB2 p.S442L ( Figure 3A ). The patient was then treated with whole brain radiotherapy (40Gy/20 fractions). Between July 2020 and December 2020, the patient was treated with osimertinib (80 mg oral administration daily), anlotinib (12mg d1-14, q3w), pemetrexed (500mg/kg q4w), and temozolomide (300mg d1-5, q4w). Then, the patient experienced less headache. The re-test of the CSF samples showed that the mutations included EGFR p.L858R, TP53, ERBB2, and others (October 28, 2021). ( Figure 3A ). In January 2021, due to the continued elevated levels of tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in his CSF ( Figure 3B ) and based on his CSF genetic test results, his treatment was switched to dacomitinib (30mg po qd), olaparib (100mg po bid), anlotinib (8mg po d1-14,q3w), pemetrexed (500mg/m2, q3w), and temozolomide (200mg/m2 d1-5, q4w). The patient's condition was stable after adjusting the treatment plan. His level of CEA was stable ( Figure 3B ), and his brain MRI showed no progression of the brain metastasis. The efficacy evaluation during the treatment period is shown in  Figure 4 . In addition, after switching to targeted therapy, the patient no longer experienced obvious headache and dizziness, and his quality of life was significantly improved. Although he had the 2nd degree bone marrow suppression, there was no obvious functional damage of the liver and kidney during the process of treatment. The patient died of cachexia caused by the tumor in June 2021. Based upon, targeted drug therapy helped this patient obtain 6 months of progression-free survival (PFS). After the diagnosis of CNS metastases, although he was no longer sensitive to osimertinib, his overall survival reached 13 months which might be benefited from the treatment of olaparib in combination with dacomitinib.\",\n",

He denied recent infections such as flu or gastroenteritis, travel, and other possible reasons, which could be responsible for the fever, which peaked at 39.5 C. Previous medical history revealed gout for 20 years, but no drugs were prescribed. His neurological examination and cranial computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1) scans were normal. EEG results showed minor irregularities in waves (5-20 muv 14-20 Hz beta) emitted from the bilateral hemispheres. Blood routine, C-reactive protein, serum vitamin B12, and folic acid, as well as other autoimmunity makers containing antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and rheumatoid factors were all unremarkable. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed an increased white blood cell (WBC) count (104 x 106/L, reference range 0-8 x 10^6/L) and elevated protein levels (1.68 g/L, reference range 0.15-0.45 g/L). Culture, smear, and bacterial, fungal, viral, and tubercle bacillus antibodies in the serum and CSF were negative. He was diagnosed with viral encephalitis and treated with antiviral agents. His symptoms eased within a week and he was discharged from the hospital. Five months later, he was referred to our hospital again due to a fever of 38.5 C and occasional sentence confusion. Another lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF had a WBC count of 39 x 10^6/L and the protein content was 1.32 g/L. The cranial MRI and laboratory test findings were almost normal except for decreased thyroid function and increased anti-thyroid autoantibody (ATA) levels in the serum and CSF. The initial findings were as follows: in the serum, the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration was 43.39 uIU/ml (reference range (RR): 0.27-4.2 uIU/ml), free triiodothyronine (FT3) concentration was 2.89 pmol/ml (RR: 3.1-6.8 pmol/ml), free thyroxine (FT4) concentration was 7.18 pmol/ml (RR: 12.0-22.0 pmol/ml), total triiodothyronine (TT3) concentration was 1.17 pmol/ml (RR: 1.3-3.1 pmol/ml), and total thyroxine (TT4) concentration was 44.26 pmol/ml (RR: 66-181 pmol/ml); the titer of anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) was 1274 IU/ml (RR: < 115 IU/ml) and the titer of anti-thyroperoxidase autoantibodies (TPOAb) was 600 IU/ml (RR: < 35 IU/ml). In the CSF, ATA was positive (TPOAb 17.06 IU/ml, TgAb 16.02 IU/ml). Ultrasound imaging indicated diffuse lesions of the thyroid. Antibody analysis of anti-NMDAR, AMPA1, AMPA2, LGI1, CASPR2, GABA, GAD, anti-Hu, Yo, Ri, MAI, MA2, CV2, Amphiphysin, SOX-1, Tr, Zic4, and GAD65, were all negative in both the serum and CSF. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with HE, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism and prescribed methylprednisolone and Euthyrox. Methylprednisolone was started at a dose of 80 mg/day for 1 week and reduced to 40 mg/day in the 2 week; subsequently, oral prednisolone was prescribed, which was weaned at a rate of 5 mg per week, that is oral prednisolone was used for a total of 8 weeks.

No associated symptoms such radiating pain, weight loss, hematuria, or change in bowel habits were reported by the patient. The patient\\'s medical, surgical, and family history were irrelevant. He also had no history of smoking. Physical examination revealed a soft lax abdomen with unremarkable systemic examination. The results of laboratory investigations, including a complete blood count, blood chemistry, serum urea, and urine analysis, were normal. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a well-defined heterogeneous enhancing lesion measuring 2 x 1.5 cm located at the posterolateral upper pole of the left kidney. The lesion was in close proximity to the spleen. There was no evidence of hydronephrosis or kidney stones. The renal vein was patent. These findings suggested renal cell carcinoma (Figure 1). Two weeks later, the patient underwent left partial nephrectomy. The resected specimen was sent for histopathological analysis. Gross examination revealed a well-circumscribed but uncapsulated white-tan soft mass with homogenous cut surface measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm located at the upper pole of the left kidney. The mass abutted but did not invade the renal capsule. No areas of necrosis were seen. No gross abnormality was observed in the rest of the renal parenchyma. Microscopic examination reveals a well-demarcated lesion composed of sheets of cells that were admixed with large, gaping, dilated cavernous-like spaces filled with blood (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). These cells are monotonous, small, and round to oval, each containing a moderate amount of eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). No pleomorphism was present. There was no evidence of necrosis (Figure 2(c)) or increased mitotic activity of more than 2/50 high-power field (HPF) (Figure 2(d)). No atypical mitosis was seen. High-power examination showed small nuclei with fine chromatin (Figure 2(f)) and smooth nuclear membrane embedded in a myxoid stroma (Figures 2(g) and 2(h)); other adjacent areas revealed hyalinized stromal reaction (Figure 2(d)). Capsular and lymphovascular invasion were not observed. Tumor cells showed diffuse and strong positivity for smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) (Figure 3(a)), vimentin, and pericellular net-like positivity for collagen type IV (Figure 3(b)). The tumor was negative for cytokeratins 7 and 20, RCC antigen, cluster of differentiation (CD10), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), desmin, CD34, CD117, CD 99, synaptophysin, chromogranin, S100, renin, Melan A, and human melanoma black-45 (HMB-45). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain failed to reveal any cytoplasmic granules in any of the examined cells. CD31 and CD34 highlighted the vascular spaces and capillary network only. Ki67 index was less than 2%. Altogether, histopathology and immunohistochemical revealed findings consistent with primary glomangioma (glomus tumor) of the kidney. One year after surgery, a follow-up examination revealed that the patient was doing well and no tumor recurrence and/or metastasis was detected.',\n",

She was monitored every 3-4 months with clinical examinations, growth parameters, and serum measurements of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione, and testosterone (Esoterix Laboratory, Calabasas Hills, CA), which together guided her medication dosing. She had no evidence of glucocorticoid excess and her growth velocity was normal, without evidence of acceleration or suppression. She and her parents reported continued excellent compliance with her medication regimen.\\nAt age 12 3/12 years, she reported 3 recent emergency department visits for persistent vomiting without diarrhea, abdominal pain, inability to tolerate oral steroids, and tachycardia. One of the episodes was accompanied by fever >39 C. There was no hypotension during any of these episodes, but heart rates were elevated ranging from 124 to 154 beats per minute. Sodium and potassium were normal: Na 137-140 meq/L (reference range, 133-143 meq/L) and K 3.6-4.1 meq/L (reference range 3.4-4.7 meq/L). Each episode was treated with normal saline boluses and intravenous stress dose steroids, and treatment led to immediate improvement in symptoms. She was discharged from the emergency department with recommendations for stress dose steroids by mouth. Over the prior 9 months, she had also unintentionally lost 2.6 kg and had an accelerated annualized growth velocity of 10.6 centimeters per year. BMI was 15.4 kg/m2 (Z-score -1.38). She denied any heat intolerance, jitteriness, palpitations, sweating, diarrhea, or vision complaints. While in clinic, her resting pulse was elevated at 136 beats per minute and blood pressure was normal. She was noted to have new symmetric thyromegaly without nodules. She had no lid lag or stare. She was in mid-puberty, with tanner 3 breasts. There was no family history of autoimmune disease or thyroid disease. Labs (Table 1) showed a suppressed TSH, and an elevated free T4 and Total T3. Thyroid antibodies were consistent with Graves' disease, with a thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) of 652% (reference range <140%). She had no prior thyroid studies for comparison. Adrenal androgens were markedly elevated with 17-OHP 11,600 ng/dl (reference range 11-155 ng/dl, target <1000 ng/dl in SW-CAH). At a clinic visit 15 weeks prior to this evaluation, her 17-OHP on the same dose of hydrocortisone (25 mg/m2/day) was improved at 639 ng/dl. She was initiated on methimazole 0.5 mg/kg/day. Her hydrocortisone dose was not changed and remained at 25 mg/m2/day. Four weeks later, repeat labs demonstrated normal free T4 with mildly suppressed TSH and normal total T3. 17-OHP was stable at 717 ng/dl (Figure 1). She had no further vomiting episodes after initiation of methimazole, and her tachycardia resolved.\\nThree months after treatment began for Graves' disease, her TSH and free T4 were in the reference range, and methimazole was decreased to 0.3 mg/kg/day. Repeat 17-OHP was low at 33 ng/dl, indicating suppression on the unchanged hydrocortisone dose of 25 mg/m2/day. Her hydrocortisone dose was decreased to 21 mg/m2/day.\",\n",

She had no significant past medical history, in particular, there was no history of diabetes and she was not on any regular medications. She had no significant occupational or travel history of significance. There was no history of exposure to tuberculosis. She was an avid gardener, residing in Darwin, Northern Territory of Australia. She usually walked barefoot in her garden and used large amounts of potting mix while gardening. She denied excessive alcohol consumption or recreational drug usage.\\nOn clinical examination, vital signs were normal. Respiratory examination was unremarkable, with normal breath sounds bilaterally and there were no crackles or rhonchi or pleural rub in particular. Cardiovascular examination was also normal. Systemic examination showed no evidence of clubbing, oedema, cyanosis or lymphadenopathy. Her ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without ischemic changes. Blood tests showed white cell count of 11.5 x 109/L with neutrophilia 7.9 x 109/L and CRP was 15 Mg/L, Serial troponins were negative. Liver function, electrolytes, renal function were within normal limits. Quantiferon gold test was negative. Pulmonary function showed FVC of 3.88 L, (97% predicted), FEV1 3.05 L (92% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio 0.787 (96% predicted), DLCO 77% and TLC 4.75L (89% predicted). Chest X-ray showed an opacity in the right mid-zone (Fig. 1a). She underwent a CT scan of the chest, that showed a mass in the right lower lobe measuring approximately 36 x 22mm suspicious of malignancy. There was no endoluminal bronchial lesion nor mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. (Fig. 1b). Due to the high index of suspicion of lung malignancy, a PET-CT was performed, which demonstrated mild to moderate FDG avidity of the mass in the right lower lobe (Fig. 2a) but no other FDG avid nodal or distant metastatic disease. The patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesion, then using the Endobrochial radial Ultrasound (EBUS) probe and utilizing the Guide sheath technique, the lesion was localized in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe. The EBUS images (Fig. 2b) demonstrated a heterogeneous lesion with non-compressed blood vessels and scattered air space shadows. Brushings, biopsies and washings were taken from the guide sheath, along with a transbronchial cryobiopsy from the same site identified by the ultrasound probe. The EBUS-guided biopsy of the lesion showed necrotic tissues and malignant cells were not identified. Culture of bronchial brushings on Ashdown's agar medium, however, grew bacterial colonies which were identified microscopically as gram negative bacilli. Bacterial culture from bronchial brushings was subsequently confirmed as Burkholderia pseudomallei, making the diagnosis of pulmonary melioidosis (Fig. 3). She was treated with intravenous ceftazidime 2 g 6 hourly for 4 weeks, followed by oral sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800mg/160mg) 2 tablets twice a day for 3 months with daily folic acid 5mg. During the follow up visits, the patient demonstrated significant improvement both clinically and radiologically. Her CRP was noted to be < 0.1 Mg/L consistently, with normal white cell and neutrophil counts. Her exertional dyspnea was considered to be related to early airway disease secondary to smoking, possibly aggravated in the presence of pulmonary melioidosis and she was provided with support for smoking cessation.\",\n",

The patient gave a history of bleeding from the swelling, which was aggravated upon brushing and chewing. The past medical and dental history were noncontributory. Clinical examination revealed a solitary, well defined, soft tissue growth on the posterior gingiva measuring about 2.5 x 1.5 cm, extending from the lingual and distal aspect of 36 to posteriorly 1 cm short of the anterior border of the ramus. The growth was sessile, dark red in colour, firm in consistency, tender on palpation, and nonfluctuant (Figure 1). Based on the history and clinical presentation a provisional diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma was made. The orthopantomograph showed no bony involvement (Figure 2). The initial clinical differential diagnosis included traumatic fibroma, peripheral giant cell lesion, neurofibroma, schwannoma, and hemangiopericytoma. Excisional biopsy was performed under local anaesthesia.\\nHistopathological examination revealed anastomosing squamous surface epithelium with elongated rete ridges. The tumor was composed mainly of streaming and interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped cells resembling fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, suggesting myofibroblastic differentiations (Figure 3), and a few mitotic figures. In some areas, the lesional cells appeared to be round or polygonal and closely packed (Figure 4). The findings were suggestive of myofibroma but a definitive diagnosis was warranted. Additional serial sections were obtained for immunohistochemical studies.\\nImmunohistochemistry showed a positive reaction in the tumor cells for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) (Figure 5) but no immunoreactivity for antibodies directed against CD34 (Figure 6). We would have also done IHC for smooth muscle-specific myosin, in order to rule out leiomyoma, which would also be SMA-positive. It is still likely that the lesion is myofibroma, however.

       "    'case_text': \"A 33-year-old female with a history of asthma presented after a witnessed out-of-hospital respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest. She had reportedly been experiencing shortness of breath and wheezing prior to her arrest. Resuscitative efforts were begun by bystanders and subsequently taken over by emergency medical services. The patient was intubated in the field and received intramuscular naloxone. She attained return of spontaneous circulation after about 15 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Upon presentation to the hospital, the patient was still comatose, but her brainstem reflexes were intact. She was noted to have an esophageal intubation and was subsequently re-intubated. On secondary survey, she was found to have a bag of heroin in her sock. Toxicology screen was positive for fentanyl. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was obtained at the time of admission and did not show any findings concerning for anoxic brain injury.\\nWithin 12 hours of resuscitation, while she was still comatose, the patient developed generalized, stimulus-sensitive myoclonic jerks involving her arms, legs, and trunk with relative sparing of her face. Her diffuse, violent jerks led her to develop rhabdomyolysis necessitating propofol infusion for symptom control and precluding her from being weaned off sedation for an accurate neurological assessment. EEG obtained on day 3 of hospitalization, while the patient was still sedated, showed diffuse anteriorly prominent alpha and beta activity and occasional periods of diffuse delta slow-waves and diffuse voltage suppression and lack of any cerebral reactivity to external stimuli. A number of diffusely distributed bilaterally synchronous spike and wave epileptiform discharges were also noted. Given her overall picture with relative paucity of findings on MRI of the brain despite significant clinical myoclonus and findings on EEG, an MRI of the cervical spine was obtained but showed no notable findings consistent with anoxic injury.\\nThe patient was started on ketamine infusion which, in addition to propofol, significantly improved her myoclonus. She was also started on valproate (1 g three times a day) and levetiracetam (2 g twice daily). By day 4-5 of her hospital course, the patient regained consciousness and was noted to have some improvement in her motor activity, though she continued to have significant stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. The patient was subsequently weaned off propofol and ketamine infusions. She was switched to clonazepam (2 mg three times daily) which, in addition to valproate and levetiracetam, significantly improved her symptoms, though she never achieved complete remission in her symptoms. Her neurological function gradually improved to the point where she was able to follow simple commands. Her sedation was weaned and the patient was subsequently extubated and transferred out of the ICU on day 11 of her hospitalization.\\nThe patient remained on clonazepam and levetiracetam. Valproate was discontinued two weeks into her hospital course due to concern for drug-induced transaminitis. She was switched to zonisamide (100 mg three times a day) and remained on this combination regimen for the next two weeks. Approximately one month into the patient's hospital course, she started to exhibit significant resting and intention myoclonus as well as dysarthria, not responding to the current treatment. She underwent another video EEG and was noted to have recurrent episodes of jerking, of which some, but not all, were associated with underlying poly-spike discharges. The clinical impression of the neurology team was that the episodes not associated with poly-spike discharges could represent some component of brainstem or spinal myoclonus. The clinical team had a lower suspicion for functional myoclonus given the patient's overall clinical picture, though it could not be fully excluded based on scalp EEG. At this point, clonazepam did not seem to be significantly helpful in achieving symptom control and it was subsequently tapered off. Instead, the patient was treated with baclofen (20 mg every 6 hours) with significant improvement in her resting myoclonus, though she continued to have intention myoclonus. She was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility for further rehabilitation. She was seen again a month after her discharge for an unrelated complaint, and while she had preserved cognition and sensorimotor function, she continued to have significant, debilitating intention myoclonus.\",\n",

The patient underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy in the left lung neoplasm. Pathological analysis revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (Figure 2A). Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of cytokeratin (CK), with CK7 and Ki-67 index of 60%, but negative staining of P63 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (Figure 2B-F). The discovered serum tumor markers included carcinoembryonic antigen (3.67 ng/mL), neuron-specific enolase (NSE; 19.36 ng/mL), and circulating cytokeration 19 fragments (CYFRA21-1; 2.15 ng/mL). Molecular analyses of exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of EGFR revealed no mutation.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with clinical stage IIIA (T1bN2M0) pulmonary adenocarcinoma with mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Optimal management requires both local and systemic disease controls; as a result, treatment for clinical stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC has been one of the most controversial topics in Thoracic Oncology. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy prior to surgical resection has been demonstrated to provide better progression-free survival (PFS) than definitive chemoradiotherapy for patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC, in several reports. The tumor was technically resectable, which involved single-zone mediastinal node. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was selected, with an aim to induce tumor downstaging, thus facilitating and simplifying the subsequent surgical treatment. After a multidisciplinary team meeting, the patient proceeded to undergo two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on day 1, every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2 from days 1 to 3, every 3 weeks) from March to April 2015. Side effects were limited to grade 1 fatigue and grade 1 nausea. Chest CT scan in May 2015 showed that the left lower lobe tumor had significantly reduced to 12.7 x 7.4 mm in size, and the enlarged mediastinal lymph node almost disappeared (Figure 3). The patient achieved partial remission (PR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nThe patient underwent left lower radical lobectomy completely (R0) resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in May 2015. The postoperative sample was confirmed as pT1aN2M0 LCNEC upon pathological examination. Immunohistochemical analysis (Figure 4) demonstrated intense immunoreactivity of CK, CK7, as well as NSE, chromogranin-A (CgA), and cluster of differentiation 56 (CD56), which was a typical LCNEC component. Immunohistochemistry showed focally positive results of synaptophysin (SyN), and negative results of P63, P40, and NapsinA. No surgery-related complications occurred. Chest CT scan 1 month after surgical resection revealed no tumor recurrence (Figure 5A and B).\\nThe patient convalesced well after surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy of the same regimen for four cycles. Meanwhile, sequential postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) at a total radiation dose of 45 Gy was given, which was divided into a daily dose of 1.5 Gy for twice after surgery for a month. The patient is followed up by tumor marker every month, and CT scan every 2 months. No evidence of recurrence has been detected during the 24-month follow-up after surgery (Figure 5C and D).',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'There is substantial third-party objective evidence that O experienced unrelenting illness that generally increased in the 10 years that preceded glycine treatment and that O\\'s education and social life were profoundly disrupted. \\nEvidence for disruption of education resides in a comprehensive set of third-party records on school attendance and nonattendance, academic performance during attendance, results from standardized academic tests, financial records from academic institutions, and written correspondence from academic administrators and city truancy officials. For 8 years before glycine treatment, there was no attendance of school or commercial tutoring. Resumption of education following the initiation of glycine treatment is likewise supported by comprehensive third-party objective evidence. Over a period of approximately 2 years, evidence for sustained and increasing improvement resides in the fact that O passed the high school equivalency exam, prepared for the SAT test in a commercial course, preformed well on SAT test and began college. Academic records indicate excellent attendance and performance. \\n Disruption of education was accompanied by disruption of social life and a housebound state. Evidence for a resumption of social life following glycine treatment is likewise supported by substantial third-party objective evidence. For example, evidence for a resumption of social life resides in email correspondence with classmates that relates to social activities at specific events and locations in his city and another city. Credit card records indicate the purchase of clothes, attendance at restaurants and concerts in his city and another city. Thus, there is clear, third-party objective evidence for resumption of an active social life and normal mobility in his city that is not subject to concerns about subject, parental, or researcher bias relating to outcome assessment. This evidence for a major reduction in preglycine life disruptions suggests a major improvement in the OCD and BDD dimensions of O\\'s illness. However, before this major improvement can be considered a genuine effect of glycine, it is necessary to rule out placebo effects and a spontaneous remission. \\n Given that placebo effects derive from patient anticipations for treatment, there is the a priori expectation that placebo effects will not be durable in individuals experiencing powerful, life-disruptive psychiatric illness. This expectation has been confirmed by Quitkin and coworkers in systematic studies of placebo effects in depression. Specifically, there is a marked tendency for placebo responses to occur abruptly within the first two weeks and to disappear within the first 12 weeks of treatment. This placebo response pattern is in contrast to what the authors regard as the response pattern for a true pharmacologic response, where the initial effects appear after a period of two weeks and tend to last 12 weeks or longer. The placebo response pattern can, of course, be seen either with a true placebo or with an active drug. These authors \"conclude that a significant portion of relapses within the first 6 weeks of treatment with an active drug are not related to loss of a true drug effect. Rather some are related to loss of nonspecific placebo effects, and abrupt nonpersistent responses during drug treatment are most likely the result of placebo effects\". They note that the early occurrence of placebo effects is consistent with the notion that they derive from patient expectations. Others have made similar observations. In relation to studies of OCD patients, Ackerman and Greenland have noted that the observation of less improvement in longer trials of active drugs may be due to placebo effects from expectations generated by side effects: \"It is possible that in the early 10-week clomipramine and 8-week fluvoxamine trials, some of the subjects in the active treatment arms responded to nonspecific study effects (such as side effects). In longer studies, that improvement was not maintained.\" Here it can be noted that Quitkin et al. suggest that \"precise assessment of drug effects probably requires several months of observation.\" \\n In view of the above considerations, we suggest that it is highly unlikely that the objective, major, and long-lasting changes in life activities that followed glycine treatment represent a placebo effect. Unlike placebo effects, the change that followed initiation of glycine treatment was not abrupt. The subject and his parents report that the first sign of improvement (leaving home without parental escort for the first time in 5 years) occurred 5 weeks after initiation of glycine consumption. Further improvement was also gradual, with third-party objective evidence documenting a gradual resumption of education and social life over treatment periods totaling 150 weeks (in an observation period of 5.3 years). This is much longer than the \"several months\" described by Quitkin et al. as sufficient to detect true drug effects. \\n Although the above studies clearly suggest that effects generated by patient expectations tend to be transient, it is nonetheless possible to observe some cases in which improvement from a known placebo appears to be enduring. For example, Quitkin observed sustained improvement in placebo-treated individuals with depression. In these cases, the authors make the reasonable suggestion that the improvement was more likely to have been a spontaneous remission than a placebo effect. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the possibility that O\\'s enduring improvement following initiation of glycine treatment was due to spontaneous evolution of illness. \\n We first note that a spontaneous remission appears unlikely on the basis of prior longitudinal studies, which suggest that both OCD and BDD generally have a continuous course, with spontaneous remissions being rare, especially in SSRI-refractory cases. Moreover, the occurrence of both disorders together tends to be associated with a worse prognosis. Although suggestive, these considerations do not constitute definitive evidence against a spontaneous remission in a specific case. \\n One approach to distinguish true efficacy from spontaneous remission in a specific case is to determine if deteriorations occur during periods of nontreatment. To pursue this approach, this study was continued until we obtained objective, third-party evidence for an unequivocal deterioration during nontreatment that avoided concerns about subject expectations and outcome assessment bias in the observations made by the subject, his parents and researchers. \\n As noted for the long off-glycine periods, OP6 and OP10, modest relapses were seen for OCD and BDD. However, the clearest evidence of deterioration was for the cognitive dimension of O\\'s illness. Most notably, third-party objective evidence derived from clinical neuropsychological testing in OP10 suggests substantial deficits in selective aspects of cognition by the end of this period. This testing with formal methods was done by a neuropsychologist who was blinded to psychiatric and treatment histories. A comparison of this off-glycine data with the excellent SAT scores obtained in the on-glycine period, OP5, suggests a substantial decline in selective aspects of cognition in OP10 relative to OP5 levels, as discussed in Section 3.5.11. All of this evidence is objective except for some neuropsychological tests that required subjective evaluation by the clinical neuropsychologist, such as the Rey-Osterrieth test. In these cases, any subjective judgments were made under blinded conditions that precluded expectations of the neuropsychologist that were based on treatment history or psychiatric diagnoses. \\n The possibility that treatment cessation could have generated expectations in our subject that somehow affected his performance on the neuropsychological testing can also be considered. We first note that the subject reports that he initiated testing because of speech difficulties. The evaluation revealed normal verbal fluency but did reveal multiple other deficits. The point here is that the deficits found were different from the subject\\'s initially expressed complaints. Further evidence against expectations for a decline in memory after glycine cessation reside in the fact that in serial interviews, the subject has expressed doubts about the validity of the tests for memory deficits and has noted that friends have commented on his excellent memory of the distant past. Moreover, he has not resumed high-dose glycine consumption in response to the test results. It can also be noted that the neuropsychologist reported that the subject was euthymic and appeared to make a full effort. \\n On the basis of the above considerations, we suggest that the third-party evidence that we present for a cognitive deterioration is either fully objective evidence or is evidence that is not compromised by an absence of blinds or by subject expectations. An important point is that the selective cognitive deterioration was substantial, since some WMS-III scores were in the first percentile and since the Rey-Osterrieth copy score was more than 8 standard deviations below the mean. We suggest that it is unlikely that scores on these tests would have been much lower had they been measured before the initiation of glycine treatment. \\n In summary, we suggest that the bias-free evidence that we present for a major improvement of OCD and BDD during treatment and for a major deterioration of selective aspects of cognition during nontreatment is consistent with the possible efficacy of glycine.\\nIn response to the success achieved in the first year of this study, a collaborative initiative was begun to test glycine with other OCD patients. The first aspect of this initiative has been a placebo-controlled study in which glycine was used as an adjunct to pre-existing pharmacotherapy. The 5 individuals who were treated with glycine had a mean decrease in Y-BOCS score of 6.04 points where as the 9 subjects treated with placebo experienced a 1.00 point decrease (P = .053) (Greenberg, Benedict, Doerfer, Perrin, Panek, Cleveland, and Javitt, Adjunctive glycine in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults). Although much larger studies are needed to determine the frequency of responders, the results of Greenberg et al. are in agreement with this case study and raise the expectation that additional OCD patients will be glycine responders. To facilitate large trials, it would be desirable to identify glycine-responsive subtypes. The comprehensive case description in this paper has been motivated, in part, by this goal.\\nTo our knowledge, this case study represents the first use of high-dose glycine with OCD or BDD and the first use of glycine alone with any psychiatric disorder. In addition, there was no psychotherapy or behavior therapy during the 5-year period of monitoring. Thus, this study is free of factors that confound the interpretations of many studies. Given the magnitude of the improvement seen in this study, we suggest that trials of glycine alone be considered for future studies.\\nIn agreement with prior studies of glycine as an adjunct to conventional medication in schizophrenia, an initial response to glycine treatment was detected in this study only 23 days after reaching the target dose. However, the improvement reported for the first 12 weeks of treatment was only a small fraction of the improvement reported for the five on-glycine treatment periods that extended over a period of almost four years. This suggests that the short clinical trials used in the past, for example, 12 weeks, may have failed to reveal the full therapeutic potential of high-dose glycine treatment in the disorders studied.\\nThe results of this high-dose glycine trial with refractory OCD, BDD, and cognition deficits are in unequivocal agreement with the main prediction of the Hypo-NMDAR-ST hypothesis that inspired its initiation. However, it is also necessary that this hypothesis be compatible with prior, well-established findings for NMDAR neurotransmission. \\n Since our hypothesis was constructed to explain the apparent behavioral effects of clarithromycin, which has been reported to inhibit NMDAR-ST at a downstream point, it is reasonable to consider if other downstream NMDAR-ST inhibitors have similar effects. There are many studies of NMDAR inhibition on human behavior, but, to our knowledge, all employ global inhibitors, such as phencyclidine and ketamine, that act on the NMDAR itself. Thus, a direct comparison is not possible. With this caveat in mind, it is nonetheless of interest to consider known effects of ketamine and phencyclidine in relation to this study. \\n To our knowledge, controlled studies with phencyclidine and ketamine have considered either healthy subjects or subjects with schizophrenia. In healthy subjects, the basic findings are deficits of cognition and other signs and symptoms that are schizophrenia-like. In subjects with schizophrenia, a worsening of existing or reactivation of previously controlled symptoms is the main presentation. In these very short-term experiments, signs and symptoms of OCD, to our knowledge, have not been reported. Although visual distortions of body parts are a prominent consequence of ketamine and phencyclidine and somatosensory abnormalities have been suggested to be an aspect of BDD deriving from parietal-occipital abnormalities, full-fledged DSM-IV BDD has not, to our knowledge, been reported in these experiments. At first sight, these findings might be considered incompatible with our hypothesis. However, general considerations suggest that local defects in NMDAR-ST could be specific for OCD/BDD. The absence of such defects in normal individuals and in individuals with schizophrenia would explain the absence of OCD/BDD in the reported ketamine and phencyclidine experiments. Here it can be noted that disorder-specific defects appear to have influenced the exacerbations induced by clarithromycin in other cases. For example, in one case, previously controlled bipolar disorder was reactivated. In another, previously controlled posttraumatic stress disorder was reactivated. \\n It can also be noted that disorder-specific defects for OCD and BDD are plausible in relation to known neurobiology. Given that SSRIs are the first line drugs for both OCD and BDD, it is possible that abnormal serotonin neurotransmission plays a causal role in these disorders in some individuals. This raises the possibility of a local, OCD/BDD-specific defect that is restricted to serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei. Recent evidence indicates that NMDAR-ST regulates the firing rate of these neurons, suggesting that deficient NMDAR-ST could lead to an abnormal firing rate. The more downstream the defect the more likely it will involve the molecular systems that produce, release, and transport serotonin. Recent clarifications of mechanisms regulating serotonergic neurotransmission reveal a complex picture in which multiple processes couple NMDAR input with serotonin release/reuptake. Defects occurring in these processes could represent OCD/BDD-specific defects in NMDAR-ST. \\n Another possibility is a deficiency of NMDAR-ST in GABA-ergic inhibitory interneurons (abundant in both the dorsal and median raphe nuclei) that regulate serotonergic neurons. This scenario can be seen as a variant of the elegant and influential theory of Olney et al. in which deficient NMDAR-ST leads to loss of feedback inhibition. The core principle of this theory, which goes beyond \"hyperglutamatergic\" or \"hypoglutamatergic\" models, is that glutamate \"functions not only as a straightforward excitatory agent in the brain, but as a major regulator of inhibitory tone\". Local NMDAR-ST deficits restricted to interneurons that regulate serotonergic neurons could reasonably be expected to lead to abnormal serotonergic tone and the emergence of OCD/BDD. \\n In both of the above scenarios, there is an absence of the more widespread perturbations expected for global NMDAR-ST inhibition by ketamine and phencyclidine. The absence of these perturbations would be compatible with the emergence of OCD/BDD without the schizophrenia-like symptoms seen with ketamine and phencyclidine. Also, in both scenarios, it would be reasonable to expect worsening of signs and symptoms by an inhibitor and improvement from an enhancer of NMDAR-ST. However, it should be emphasized that the above analysis is intended only to suggest plausibility of disorder-specific defects, not to propose a specific mechanism for the case under study. \\n Although OCD and BDD have not been seen in ketamine experiments with humans, some of the cognitive deficits seen in O show substantial overlap with the cognitive effects of ketamine. A consistent finding in multiple ketamine studies is a robust, dose-dependent decrease in verbal declarative memory that occurs at doses below those that induce schizophrenia-like symptoms. Deficits in verbal memory and learning in ketamine experiments have been assessed with story recall and list learning tests. For example, Newcomer et al. found a dose-dependent decrease in verbal memory under ketamine using a paragraph recall test from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Immediate and delayed recall scores from this study can be compared with O\\'s corresponding scores on a revised version of this test, the WMS-III. O\\'s Auditory Immediate and Auditory Delayed scores were in the ~1st percentile. In other ketamine studies, a robust decline in verbal memory has been found with list learning tests such as the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT). These results can be compared with the significant deficits seen in O\\'s scores on the CVLT-II, where the T score for Trials 1-5 was ~36 (Z = - 1.4) and Z-scores for delayed recalls (free and cued) ranged from ~-2 to ~-2.5, except for the short delay free recall, which was ~-1. The Z-score for total hits was ~-4. Thus, O\\'s off-glycine deficits in verbal memory are strongly reminiscent of those induced by ketamine. This similarity is clearly supportive of our hypothesis. Also supportive are O\\'s very high on-glycine scores on the GED and verbal SAT tests (99th and 90th percentiles, resp.), which suggest much improved verbal learning and memory in an on-glycine state, as discussed above. \\n The finding that ketamine-induced cognition deficits appear at doses lower than those needed for other types of symptoms is also of relevance to our hypothesis. Assuming that an endogenous NMDAR-ST defect would mimic ketamine, this finding leads us to expect that the return to a deficient NMDAR-ST state after cessation of glycine would manifest itself with a cognitive relapse whose emergence is earlier and more pronounced than the relapses for other categories of signs and symptoms. Our data from OPs 6 and 10 appear to be consistent with this prediction. Also of relevance is the fact that in the initial emergence of illness in early childhood, difficulties in cognition appeared before obsessive-compulsive behaviors and BDD-related signs and symptoms. \\n Finally, we note that additional support for our Hypo-NMDAR-ST hypothesis can be found in the course of O\\'s illness. Specifically, it is known that NMDAR inhibition has mild behavioral effects in childhood and much larger effects after puberty. Assuming that an endogenous NMDAR-ST defect would imitate an inhibitor, it follows that O\\'s very mild illness in childhood and the emergence of much more incapacitating illness after age 15 are consistent with an NMDAR-ST deficit.\\nAlthough the findings of this study support the Hypo-NMDAR-ST hypothesis on which it is based, it is appropriate to consider our findings in the light of alternative hypotheses proposed by others. \\nOne of the defining features of the PANDAS subtype is the occurrence of exacerbations with sudden, abrupt onset. The exacerbations are described as \"typically quite dramatic, with patients reporting that their symptoms \"...came on overnight\" or \"...appeared all of a sudden a few days after I had a sore throat.\"\" The fine details of O\\'s exacerbations are not congruent with this picture. For O\\'s age-19 exacerbation that followed a positive throat culture, detailed notes of O\\'s father indicate an improved relationship with his son during the acute phase of the infection. The behavioral deterioration is described as beginning \"as soon as the infection cleared.\" Worsening of existing symptoms (e.g., line-crossing obsession) occurred 24 days after the positive throat culture. Episodes of violent imagery appeared for the first time approximately 40 days after the positive throat culture. In addition to the slower kinetics, O\\'s nonresponse to IVIG therapy is unlike some PANDAS patients.\\nAlthough, O\\'s case cannot be classified as a clear case of PANDAS, it is still possible that it involves an antigen-specific autoimmune response induced by GABHS. There are, of course, multiple precedents, both experimental and theoretical, for the induction of antigen-specific anti-self-immune responses by foreign antigens that cross-react with self-epitopes or interact with self-receptors. Thus, the occurrence in O of two exacerbations following probable GABHS infections is immediately suggestive of an antigen-specific autoimmune mechanism. This follows from the major precedent residing in rheumatic fever (RF) as an antigen-specific autoimmune disease primed by GABHS. A comparison of O\\'s illness with RF is therefore warranted. \\n As expected for a pathogen-induced, antigen-specific autoimmune disease, recurrences of RF in adulthood are associated with probable reinfection with GABHS, often as a result of known, close contact with children having GABHS infections. The time interval between an initial occurrence of acute RF in childhood and a subsequent occurrence in adulthood can be multiple decades. During these long periods, there is an annual occurrence of upper respiratory viral infections, some of which are \"flu-like.\" As expected for infections which are unlikely to be antigenically related to GABHS, there is no retriggering of RF. Another point is that penicillin prophylaxis is effective in preventing a return of RF. This would not be expected if viral infections significantly trigger recurrence of RF. \\n In contrast to RF, exacerbations in O\\'s case and in some PANDAS cases appear to follow both GABHS and non-GABHS infections. It appears that Sydenham\\'s chorea, a sequela of RF, can reoccur without GABH infection. One might propose that, in these cases, antigen-specific clones primed by an initial GABHS infection are somehow retriggered by other pathogens, such as viruses. However, the failure to see this phenomenon in RF represents a major challenge to this proposal. \\n One possibility is that the putative brain injury responsible for O\\'s case arises from nonantigen-specific consequences of GABHS and other infections. Such a mechanism would be compatible with recurrence from both GABHS and non-GABHS infections and would not be incompatible with the peripheral antibrain antibodies reported in the recent literature, since the latter could be a result (rather than a primary cause) of brain injury due to the release of antigens from an immunologically protected site. Here it is of interest that Husby et al. who in 1976 found antistriatal antibodies in patients with Sydenham\\'s chorea, also found similar titers of antistriatal antibodies (using identical techniques) in patients with Huntington\\'s chorea. This led in 1977 to the suggestion that Huntington\\'s chorea could be an infection-triggered autoimmune disease. The latter is now known to be a polyglutamine disease that involves preferential death of striatal neurons. In brain-injury models of this type, it is formally possible that antibrain antibodies arising from brain injury could play a secondary role in pathogenesis. However, the demonstration that such antibodies play a causal role is a difficult task that is technically inaccessible in the absence of validated animal models, which are unavailable for psychiatric disorders that involve high-level human thinking.',\n",

Physical examination also showed sparse scalp hair and eyebrows ( Figures 2C, D ), absence of axillary and pubic hair, hypotrophy testicles, small penis, and intellectual disability. Laboratory tests revealed that his fasting glucose was 14.91 mmol/L, HbA1c was 9.0%, he had negative insulin antibodies, low IGF-1 level of 43 ng/ml (reference range: 111-320 ng/ml), low testosterone and LH. Routine blood tests also suggested that the patient had anemia and thrombocytopenia. Insulin and C-peptide release tests showed low insulin, C-peptide secretion ( Supplementary Table 1B ) and low HOMA-beta. Thyroid hormone tests revealed normal thyroid function. The patient exhibited an uneven pancreatic density by abdominal CT scan ( Figure 3B ), empty sella by pituitary MRI ( Figures 3C, D ), and osteoporosis that was not consistent with actual age by hip CT scan ( Figure 3E ). Before admission to the hospital, the patient had oral hypoglycemic agents to control glucose, and insulin pump treatment was given after admission to the hospital, but the glucose control was poor.\\n5ml venous blood was collected from the proband (II-1,  Figure 1A ) and her family members (I-1, I-2, II-2 and II-3,  Figure 1A ). Whole Exome sequencing (WES) was performed on proband using the xGen  Exome Research Panel v1.0 (IDT, USA) on the Illumina NovaSeq6000. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood, then sheared by sonication and hybridized for enrichment. And the library was enriched for target regions, sequencing was performed to generate 150 bp paired-end reads. To identify mutations, sequencing data was analyzed and annotated according to an in-house pipeline which we describe before. Based on the variant annotations, a series of prioritization strategies were applied to identify candidate variants associated with the phenotypes. The detailed steps were as follows: (1) excluding variants outside exonic and splicing regions; (2) excluding variants with minor allele frequency >=0.01 according to public databases (GnomAD, 1000 Genomes and ExAC); (3) excluding synonymous variants; (4) excluding variants not presenting damaging results in the function prediction from clinPred. To prioritize the most likely candidate disease-causing gene, all candidate genes were then ranked by Phenolyzer. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Identifiers of the proband's disease phenotype (anemia, HP:0001903; alopecia, HP:0001596; diabetes mellitus, HP:0000819; hypogonadism, HP:000013; intellectual disability, HP:0001249) were input as phenotype terms into Phenolyzer. To confirm the candidate disease-causing variant, we PCR-amplified the genomic DNA fragments in the proband (II-1) and her family members (I-1, I-2, II-4 and III-2), then sequenced them by Sanger sequencing. The PCR primer pairs were uses as followings: forward 5'-TCCTGGGTCCAGAGTTCTTT-3', reverse 5'-TGGGGTGTTTGGCTAAAAGT-3').\\nBased on the aligned reads, 76,241 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 13,038 indels (deletions and insertions, <50bp) were identified by WES. After three filters of prioritization strategies, 271 variants from 244 genes were kept. Both these genes and HPO Identifiers of phenotypes of the proband were input Phenolyzer. Phenolyzer suggested that WSS was the most likely disease that can explain the syndrome phenotypes of the proband, and the DCAF17 gene was the candidate gene ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). A homozygous deletion DCAF17:c.1488_1489delAG was detected at genomic position 172,337,546-172,337,547 of chromosome 2 (GRCh37/Hg19), resulting in frameshift in reading frame in exon 14 leading to premature stop codon ( Figure 1B ). The full-length DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 17 contains 520 amino acids. The premature termination was predicted to cause a truncated protein comprising 506 amino acids. The first 495 residues corresponding to the normal protein and the other extra 11 derived from the frameshift deletion. Sanger sequencing analysis showed the identified c.1488_1489delAG (deletion of nucleotide AG in coding region 1488-1489) was segregated with the disease in this family, which was in homozygous status in the proband's affected sibling (II-2) and heterozygous status in the proband's unaffected parents (I-1 and I-2) and sibling (II-3) ( Figure 1A ). Additionally, the identified variant allele has been recorded in the database of gnomAD with an extremely low allele frequency at 3/251,124 (dbSNP rs778488574). According to the ACMG/AMP criteria, the raw homozygous frameshift variant DCAF17:c.1488_1489delAG was classified as a pathogenic variant for WSS.\",\n",

His vital signs were stable, but the blood test results indicated anaemia (hemoglobin level 8.2 g/dL).\\nThe emergency angiogram through the right femoral artery showed active extravasation of contrast medium from the ruptured aneurysm of the third right lumbar artery, which was successfully selected using a manually curved 4 Fr hook shaped catheter (RC-09; Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) (Fig. 2). At the distal side of the aneurysm, the lumbar artery branched into three. Through the 4 Fr catheter, a 2.9 Fr catheter (microcatheter with two coils for support; Hi-Lex, Takarazuka, Japan) was coaxially inserted using a 0.018 inch guidewire (AQUA VIII guidewire; Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH, USA).

In the past she had recovered from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and currently was on antihypertensive medication (candesartan cilexetil once a day). She had led a physically active country life style prior to the presentation of the problem and had never smoked in her life.\\nAt presentation there was painful limitation of right sided shoulder abduction to less than 90 degrees. Ultrasound documented a 9mm x 14mm partial width full thickness footprint tear of the anterior to mid right supraspinatus with tendinosis of most of the tendon and enthesopathy at the greater tuberosity of the humeral head ( Figure 1). A plain radiograph of the right shoulder showed a down-sloping Type 2 acromion. There was mild wasting of the right supraspinatus muscle. A diagnosis of a recent footprint tear superimposed on degenerative supraspinatus tendon with mild muscle atrophy was made. Following written informed consent from the patient, 8ml of autologous unclotted blood was venesected and centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 3000 rotations per minute in a special tube for PRP preparation (BCT, REGEN Labs, Switzerland). 4 to 5ml of liquid PRP was injected through a 22g 5cm long needle into the tear and its margins with simultaneous percutaneous tenotomy directed into the footprint of the anterior facet of the greater tuberosity under direct ultrasound imaging control (GE Logic 9, 9MHz probe). 5ml 1% lignocaine was injected into the superficial soft tissues, subacromial bursa and the supraspinatus tear for local anaesthetic purposes. The shoulder was placed in a sling with 90 degree elbow flexion for 7 days. Physiotherapy was commenced at 4 to 5 weeks post PRP with a home exercise program. At 8 weeks follow up post PRP the patient verbally reported a marked reduction in pain with improvement in shoulder movement. At the 7 and 10 month follow up there was complete relief from pain with full range of movement of the right shoulder and she was able to lift bags of potting mix in her farm. At the 10 month follow up, ultrasound (GE Logic 9, 9MHz probe) performed by the author showed a near complete echogenic infilling obliterating the tear defect. The lateral margin of the tear merged with this neotendon tissue with mild medial retraction ( Figure 2). She was completely pain free at a follow up 1 year after PRP injection.\",\n",

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 96 mm/hr (0-15 mm/hr) and 143.7 mg/l (<5 mg/l), respectively. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and retroviral screens were negative. Hb electrophoresis-Hb A2-3%, Hb F-38.8%, Hb S-57.7%. The rheumatoid factor, ANA, and ENA panel were negative.\\nThe initial diagnoses considered were juvenile idiopathic arthritis, septic arthritis of the left knee, systemic vasculitis, relapsing polychondritis (RP), and Cogan\\'s syndrome, but the condition was subsequently confirmed to be RP with inflammatory arthritis based on the diagnostic criteria by McAdam et al. She initially fulfilled 4 out of the 6 features which are as follows: recurrent chondritis of both auricles, nonerosive inflammatory arthritis, inflammation of ocular structures, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and later went on to develop an additional feature of chondritis of laryngeal and or tracheal cartilages as outlined below.\\nShe was admitted and started on intravenous (IV) clindamycin 180 mg 6 hourly and IV ciprofloxacin 200 mg 12 hourly for septic arthritis; oral ibuprofen 200 mg 12 hourly, oral paracetamol 250 mg 8 hourly, and prednisolone 15 mg daily to which she showed initial signs of response. The steroids and analgesia were started to help control the inflammation and pain associated with the disease. However, her disease flared up again with significant knee pain and swelling, a left conjunctival injection associated with pain, and high inflammatory markers. Prednisolone was increased from 15 mg to 20 mg daily, and oral methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly and folic acid 5 mg weekly were introduced. The inflammation in the eye persisted, though there was a reduction in inflammatory markers (ESR 70 mm/hr., CRP 111.7 mg/l) at subsequent reviews. The methotrexate dose was titrated up to 10 mg weekly, and the prednisolone dose was further increased to 30 mg daily. Two months after initiation of therapy, she had resolution of the auricular inflammation and a reduction in intermittent eye inflammation. Her knee swelling and tenderness had improved (Figure 2(c)), with a significant decline in her inflammatory markers (ESR-34 mm/hr, CRP 42.7 mg/l). The dose of methotrexate was increased further from 10 mg to 15 mg weekly. This was to provide steroid-sparing treatment, as she still had significant symptoms despite the higher doses of steroids used for control of inflammation. Despite the increase in the methotrexate dose, there was still significant disease activity after 2 months which signified some degree of corticosteroid dependence. The dose of prednisolone was tapered gradually at a dose of 5 mg weekly anytime there was a decrease in inflammatory markers, suggesting a reduction in inflammation.\\nDue to failure to respond adequately to methotrexate, as evidenced by the frequency of disease flares and worsening of her eye symptoms, she also developed cataracts due to the high doses of steroids used. This led to the introduction of infliximab 10 months into treatment. She received the loading course of 100 mg of intravenous infliximab at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, but was unable to continue with the maintenance therapy of 8-weekly infusions due to financial constraints. Despite the short course of infliximab, clinical benefits such as reduction in arthritis and eye inflammation were noted. Six weeks after her last infliximab infusion, she developed difficulty breathing.\\nThis progressed, leading to her presenting in the emergency room with signs of respiratory distress. On examination, she had audible inspiratory stridor, tachypnea, inspiratory rhonchi, and a slight reduction in breath sounds bilaterally, though vesicular in nature.\\nLateral cervical X-ray showed partial narrowing in the region of the cricoid cartilage (Figure 3). A diagnosis of upper airway obstruction (subglottic) secondary to perichondritis of the cricoid cartilage with respiratory fatigue was made upon review by the otorhinolaryngologist and pulmonologist. Treatment ensued with intravenous dexamethasone 2 mg 8 hourly, nebulized Pulmicort 500 mcg 12 hourly, and salbutamol 2.5 mg 4 hourly, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. An emergency tracheostomy to relieve the subglottic stenosis was performed. She recovered well and was discharged on day 4 of admission.\\nHer medications were reviewed, taking into account the financial challenges to include oral colchicine 500 mcg twice daily, oral methotrexate 15 mg weekly and oral prednisolone 40 mg daily which was to be tapered gradually. Knee synovitis persisted, requiring intra-articular injections of 80 mg of methylprednisolone acetate into each joint. Tracheostomy care was carried out regularly at the otorhinolaryngology department, and close vigilance for infection was maintained.\\nA year and a half from the start of her treatment, she developed mid- to low-back pain. An X-ray of the lumbosacral spine showed a vertebral collapse at the L1 vertebra. A compression fracture was confirmed on MRI, with similar but less pronounced changes seen in T11, L3, and L4 vertebrae, suggestive of a bone softening process in keeping with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and underlying hemoglobinopathy (Figure 4).\\nSteroid dose reduction continued and bisphosphonate therapy with alendronate 35 mg weekly was introduced. Oral dapsone 25 mg daily was added to her treatment for disease control due to its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties, but she continues to have remitting and relapsing disease.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 69-year-old man with severe COPD requiring chronic oxygen supplementation (1 L/min) and suspected underlying X-linked granulomatous disease was admitted to the ICU with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. He had a progressively worsening cough, shortness of breath, increased sputum production and had experienced a 10 kg weight loss with muscle depletion in the preceding three months. The patient had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 23 years, with no subsequent recurrence of infection. Chronic treatment with clomipramine (75 mg/day) was ongoing for a major depressive syndrome which had been diagnosed five years earlier. He was being monitored with monthly seriated electrocardiograms for QT prolongation attributable to clomipramine therapy.\\nAt ICU admission, the patient presented with severe dyspnea. Arterial blood-gas analysis showed mixed respiratory failure (pH 7.22, PaO2 58 mmHg, PaCO2 80 mmHg, HCO3- 35 mMol/L) requiring non-invasive ventilation. Chest examination revealed bilateral crackles, with no signs of chronic heart failure. Blood tests showed the white blood cell count to be in the normal range (8000/mm3), with no neutropenia (neutrophil count 1846/mm3), but mild lymphopenia was present (lymphocytes 810/mm3). The patient was anemic (Hb 10.9 g/dL). Platelet count was high (438,000/muL) and C-reactive protein (CRP) was markedly increased (35 mg/L; normal level <5 mg/L). Renal function was normal (serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL), as were liver function tests (aspartate transaminase [AST] 11 IU/L, alanine transaminase [ALT] 14 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT] 30 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.15 mg/dL). Baseline electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block and prolonged QT interval (453 ms).\\nChest x-ray showed multiple bilateral lung opacities. CT and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT scans revealed bilateral nodular infiltrates.\\nDue to the patient's critical condition and the multiple potential etiologies for the pulmonary infection, a bronchoscopy was performed, which demonstrated purulent secretions. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, Actinomyces spp. and Nocardia, but tested positive for galactomannan (GM; ODI 2.6).\\nAccording to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria for non-neutropenic patients, the diagnosis of probable IPA was made based on the presence of baseline predisposing comorbidities (severe COPD and suspected X-linked granulomatous disease), the presence of bilateral nodular infiltrates, and GM positivity on BAL.\\nVoriconazole was considered unsuitable due to the patient's baseline QT prolongation and the risk of a drug-drug interaction with clomipramine, potentially leading to further QT prolongation and severe cardiac arrhythmias. Isavuconazole therapy was selected, and started with a loading dose of 200 mg every 8 h for six doses, following by 200 mg daily.\\nAfter starting antifungal treatment with isavuconazole, the patient showed a progressive improvement in his clinical condition. At week 2, the arterial blood-gas analysis showed resolution of the decompensated respiratory acidosis, with normalization of pH (pH 7.40, PaO2 62 mmHg, PaCO2 50 mmHg, HCO3- 30 mMol/L). There was no further need of non-invasive ventilation. On day 17, the patient was moved from the ICU to the infectious diseases ward, and required only low flow oxygen supplementation (1 L/min). He was discharged on day 42. CT scanning and FDG-PET/TC after eight weeks of antifungal treatment confirmed the improvement of pulmonary infiltrates. In total, a three-month course of isavuconazole treatment was completed, and there were no clinical or radiologic signs of infection after six months' follow-up. Isavuconazole was well-tolerated, with no adverse events and no change in liver enzymes. Serial ECG monitoring showed no prolongation of the QT interval.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 39 years old man was admitted to our hospital on January 2, 2019 with the chief complaint of recurrent diarrhea and black stool for 3 weeks. A gastroscopy showed erosion, hyperplasia and protuberance of cardia mucosa. Pathological biopsy of the protuberant lesions showed cardia adenocarcinoma. Further immunohistochemistry showed MSH2 (+), MSH6 (+), PMS2 (+), MLH1 (+), HER-2 (2+). And negative for HER-2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test and Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. A positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) was conducted and showed thickened gastric cardia wall, multiple enlarged lymph nodes with high standard uptake value (SUV), including left supraclavicular lymph nodes, multiple lymph nodes adjacent to the cardia and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, multiple destructive bones (left scapula, right 5th rib, Th8-10 vertebrae, L3 left adnexa, sacrum and left iliac bone). He denied any family history of hereditary diseases and special medical history. The laboratory examination showed elevated carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA19-9) of 52.1U/ml and normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level.\\nAfter admission, the patient received 4 cycles of FOLFOX4 chemotherapy from January 9, to February 27, 2019. After the initial 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient complaint of aggravated chest and back pain. Besides, CA125 and CA19-9 were increased from 32.1 U/ml to 62.9 U/ml and from 52.1 U/ml to 78.4 U/ml respectively. A computed tomography (CT) scan suggested an increase in the size of metastatic lymph nodes and the extent of bone metastases compared to that before treatment (Figure 1). Thus, the curative effect was evaluated as progressive disease (PD) with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.5 months.\\nIn order to look for more effective treatment, a next generation sequencing (NGS) (unpublished report) was performed and showed CCND1 gene amplification, RICTOR gene amplification, TMB-L (TMB 5 Muts/Mb) and MSS. The immunohistochemistry of PD-L1 with 22C3 antibody showed a Combined Positive Score (CPS) with 0 (Supplementary Figure 1). Then, the patient accepted second-line chemotherapy of albumin paclitaxel combined with tegafur (S-1) for 6 cycles from March 15th to July 10th, 2019. In the meantime, thoracic spine and lumbar spine radiotherapy of DT 36Gy/12F was performed to relieve the pain. CT scans after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy suggested sustained stable disease (SD). CA125 and CA19-9 decreased to the normal level during the second-line chemotherapy gradually. The patient reported improving quality of life by relieving pain. Thus, single agent maintenance chemotherapy with S-1 was initiated from Aug. 2nd,2019. The regular visit 2 months later showed increased CA19-9 from 30.8 U/ml to 354 U/ml. And the pain was aggravated gradually. The CT scan suggested PD with newly formed bone metastases after maintenance chemotherapy with S-1 for only 2 months (Figure 2). Therefore, a third-line treatment was considered. And in the choice of third-line treatment regimen, either Apatinib or anti-PD-1 was considered according to the Chinese guideline at that time. While considering that the previous paclitaxel was effective as the second line therapy and the high cost of Apatinib or PD-1 antibody at that time, single-agent docetaxel was accepted as the final choice. Docetaxel was used for 3 cycles. And at the same time, right iliac and left acromioclavicular head radiotherapy was conducted at a dose of 30Gy/10F to relieve the pain. The evaluation after three cycles of third line docetaxel showed enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and axilla with aggravated cough, which suggested PD (Figure 3).\\nLuckily, a clinical trial of PD-1 antibody SCT-I10A (unlisted) for metastatic gastric cancer was recruiting in our center and the patient was a qualified participant. After informed consent, the patient took part in the clinical trial and received the first dose of PD-1 antibody (SCT-I10A) on January 10, 2020. Surprisingly, the patient reported that the cough disappeared around 3 weeks after the first dose of the drug. Then, due to the pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the treatment was discontinued for nearly 3 months without any treatment. After the pandemic, the patient returned to the hospital for further evaluation. The result showed reduced pleural fluid, shrunken mediastinal, neck, axillary and retroperitoneal lymph nodes and normal tumor markers, which were suggestive of partial response (PR) (Figure 4). Considering the inspiring response, another 23 cycles of PD-1 antibody therapy were conducted with the last treatment on 2021.7.16 and the efficacy was assessed as sustained PR.\\nTo further clarify whether this patient has specific gene mutations that make him sensitive to immunotherapy, a NGS test of peripheral blood was conducted on Jan. 28th, 2021. The results showed no gene mutations with MSS and TMB-L.\\nUp to now, the patient has an overall survival (OS) of over 30 months and has no discomfort. The timeline of patient treatment and change of tumor markers was shown in Supplementary Figure 2.',\n",

Written informed consent for publication of any case details and any accompanying images was obtained from the patient's family. A 77-year-old male was taken to our emergency department after being found at the foot of a flight of stairs in a semicomatose state. Although nobody witnessed the fall, the trauma was apparent from multiple abrasions and bruising on the face and chest. Upon arrival at the emergency room, the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was 6 (E1M3V2), and the pupil size and light reflex were intact. The neurologic examination demonstrated no focal neurologic deficits, including motor weakness or sensory change in all four extremities. The patient had no underlying disease such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease, and did not take any medication that induces coagulopathy.\\nInitial CT of the brain disclosed diffuse SAH of the basal cistern, accompanying intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and hydrocephalus, which are common in nontraumatic aneurysmal SAH (Figure 1). Despite the external wounds and skull fracture, the appearance of the SAH was different from that of usual traumatic SAH, which typically shows small amounts of blood in the sulci of the cerebral convexities. We suspected that an aneurysm might have ruptured spontaneously just before the patient fell down the stairs, causing trauma secondarily. However, the subsequent head and neck CT angiography failed to reveal a cerebral aneurysm or other vascular malformation that could give rise to basal SAH.\\nWe performed extraventricular drainage (EVD) emergently at the right Kocher's point to relieve the hydrocephalus. The opening pressure was as high as 15 cm H2O and the intracranial pressure (ICP) decreased after draining the bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the patient showed minimal neurologic improvement postoperatively.\\nAfter stabilizing the ICP, we performed digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to identify a cerebral aneurysm or other vascular malformation that might have been missed on CT angiography. The DSA disclosed a 1.8 mm sized traumatic pseudoaneurysm at the mid-portion of the right PCoA that was inapparent on CT angiography (Figure 2). We observed extravasation of contrast media from it, resulting in basal SAH (Figure 2B). In this manner, because no other aneurysm or pre-existing vascular abnormality was found on DSA, the patient's basal SAH was confirmed as traumatic in origin.\\nAfter confirming adequate blood flow of the right posterior cerebral artery through the posterior circulation, we performed endovascular trapping from the mid- to distal portion of the right PCoA using coils (Figure 3A and B). There was no intraoperative unexpected event or thromboembolic complication. Postoperatively, we confirmed the absence of extravasated contrast media and intactness and patency of the collateral vessels (Figure 3C and D). Despite successful trapping of the PCoA, the patient had an unfavorable clinical course. Although the patient's mental status improved minimally, to stuporous mentality, the hydrocephalus persisted, requiring repeated EVD. The patient did not recover alert mentality and was transferred to another local hospital.\",\n",

He denied any history of trauma to the leg and reported that he was driving when he noticed a 'pop' noise from his right leg. Since then he had noticed gradually increasing swelling, pain and discoloration of the leg. His social history was significant for consumption of twelve 16-ounce bottles of beer every day for 20 years (232 g of alcohol daily). He denied any history of blood in stool or urine, epistaxis, easy bruising or bleeding in joints or any surgeries in the past. His family history was noncontributory in terms of bleeding disorders.\\nAt first presentation, his pulse was 96/min, blood pressure 137/79 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 98.7 F. General examination showed a well-developed man in no distress, with pallor and icterus. Local examination was significant for severe tenderness over the right calf region with tense rigidity. Extensive tense ecchymosis was noted over the back of the right leg extending from the lower gluteal fold to the ankle (fig. 1). Distal pulses were intact. Neurologic examination showed intact power and sensation to pain, pressure and vibration. Systemic examination was significant for smooth liver margin palpable at least 2 cm below the costal margin with a liver span of approximately 9 cm and splenomegaly. Labs at admission were significant for hemoglobin (9.2 mg/dl), hematocrit (26.8%), reticulocyte index (1.4), mean corpuscular volume (105.2 fl) and platelet count (64,000/mul). Liver function tests showed total bilirubin 7.2 mg/dl and direct bilirubin 2.1 mg/dl, total protein 6.5 g/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl, alkaline phosphatase 164 U/l, gamma-glutamyltransferase 133 U/l, aspartate aminotransferase 59 U/l and alanine aminotransferase 30 U/l. Coagulation profile showed prothrombin time 25.1, activated partial thromboplastin time 44.2 and international normalized ratio 2.43. Direct Coombs test was negative. Creatinine kinase at admission was 63 U/l. Individual coagulation factor assays are shown in table 1. A computed tomography scan of the lower extremity without contrast showed multiple loculated fluid collections in the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle which measured 4.5 x 2.6 cm (fig. 2). Compartment syndrome was ruled out in the absence of signs of gangrene or neurovascular compromise. After admission, the patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma to correct the coagulopathy; however, overnight his hemoglobin dropped to 7.2 g/dl, which raised suspicion of rebleed. Doppler ultrasound of the legs showed a stable hematoma of 14.2 x 3.0 x 4.2 cm and a fecal occult blood sample was negative for blood. Abdominal ultrasound showed nodular appearance of the liver consistent with cirrhosis and splenomegaly and a large ascites. Ascitic fluid analysis showed a high serum-ascites albumin gradient which was consistent with cirrhosis as the cause of ascites. Other causes of cirrhosis were ruled out with a negative autoimmunity workup and negative hepatitis profile. Serum and urine immunofixation were negative for monoclonal bands. Though the patient did not exhibit any neurologic signs, we ruled out Wilson's disease with a normal ceruloplasmin level. Coagulopathy workup showed prolonged thrombin time and correction of prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time on both immediate and incubated mixing studies, indicating factor deficiency.\\nSpecific factor assays showed depletion of all factors except for factor VIII, which further confirmed the suspicion that the factor depletion was secondary to liver cirrhosis. Liver biopsy was deferred in view of the deranged coagulation profile. He was discharged after 8 days in stable condition, having been told that he had a life-threatening condition and that complete abstinence from alcohol for 6 months would be necessary before transplantation could be considered. Screening esophagoscopy showed large esophageal varices without any stigmata of bleeding. On follow-up visits to the outpatient clinic the hematoma continued to resolve, however liver function tests and coagulation profile continued to worsen. Four months later he was readmitted with worsening ascites and increasing bilateral swelling. He was found to have renal insufficiency and a high serum-ascites albumin gradient. He was also diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; the presentation was suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome. The patient requested a return to his home country (Mexico) for further care. This was arranged with the help of palliative services.\",\n",

Rheumatoid arthritis had been diagnosed 5 years prior when she presented with polyarthralgia and positivity for rheumatoid factor. Prednisolone, methotrexate, and subcutaneous etanercept were prescribed, and complete clinical remission had been achieved after 2 years of treatment. The medications were then discontinued, and the patient sustained her clinical remission afterward.\\nThe patient had developed both ankle edema 4 months prior to this admission, which slowly progressed to the pretibial areas. Her urine appeared foamier for 2 months, which was accompanied by rising of blood pressure according to a home monitoring device. Urine color and volume were unchanged from the patient's perspective. Physical examination indicated high blood pressure (190/94 mm Hg), bilateral pitting edema, and livedo reticularis of both legs. No other skin lesion was found. There was no active arthritis, fever, or lymphadenopathy. The results of the initial investigation are displayed in Table 1, which shows a serum creatinine of 1.86 mg/dL, dysmorphic red blood cells in urine, and proteinuria.\\nFurther investigations showed a positive result for antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a homogeneous, fine-speckled, and nucleolar pattern (titer > 1:1280). The level of rheumatoid factor was 54.40 IU/mL (normal < 20 IU/mL). Serum cryoglobulin was positive. Serological tests for HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. The serology results for hepatitis B virus (HBV) were negative for HBsAg, positive for anti-HBc, and positive for anti-HBs antibodies. Complement C3 was normal, and C4 was 3.09 mg/dL (10-40 mg/dL).\\nA percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed and kidney pathology is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The kidney pathology revealed diffuse endocapillary hypercellularity and mesangial expansion with lobular accentuation of glomeruli in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining demonstrated global and diffuse double-contour thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, which was compatible with a pattern of MPGN. No crescentic lesion was observed.\\nThe immunofluorescence (IF) study revealed predominant IgM (2+) staining. IgG (1+) and C3 (1+) granular staining in mesangium and capillary loops were also observed. Equivalent kappa and lambda staining was found in the capillary loops (1+). C1q and IgA results were negative. Figure 3 displays the results of an electron microscopic (EM) study, which revealed the deposition of organized electron-dense materials at the mesangium and subendothelium. The substructures were composed of short microtubules (~20 nm thickness) with hollow centers. Neomembrane formation and diffuse foot process effacement were also noted.\\nThe positive result for serum cryoglobulin, bilateral skin rash compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, polytypic IgM-dominant deposits in the IF study, and organizing deposits in the EM study help to narrow the diagnosis to cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. The kidney pathology did not show any light-chain restriction since there was equal intensity of kappa and lambda staining, suggesting mixed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. The underlying cause of cryoglobulinemia was then investigated in this elderly patient.\\nCommon causes of mixed cryoglobulinemia such as HCV and HBV were ruled out by negative serology results. The results of age-appropriate cancer screenings including colonoscopy, mammography, and pelvic examination were all negative. However, serum protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal spike of 0.35 g/dL. Serum immunofixation showed IgM kappa monoclonal gammopathy. The immunofixation of cryoprecipitate was not done at that time due to the logistic issue in the out-patient setting. Serum kappa was 248.31 mg/dL (3.3-19.4 mg/dL) and serum lambda was 40.84 mg/dL (5.71-26.30 mg/dL) with a kappa-to-lambda free light-chain ratio of 6.08. These findings raised the possibility of lymphoproliferative disorder. However, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed normocellular trilineage marrow without evidence of abnormal clonality, lymphoma, or plasma cell disorders.\\nBased on all evidence, particularly the detectable monoclonal IgM kappa gammopathy in the patient's serum despite not revealing lymphoproliferative disease, a diagnosis of MGRS with non-hepatitis-associated mixed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis was suspected. After a multidisciplinary team discussion and informing the patient of all the possibilities, clone-directed therapy was initiated, including a 3-week cycle of oral cyclophosphamide at 200 mg/day and dexamethasone. After six cycles, the bilateral leg edema and rash were completely resolved. Serum creatinine was decreased to 0.83 mg/dL, and proteinuria was 0.49 g/g creatinine. The monoclonal protein level was decreased to 0.13 g/dL, and the serum kappa-to-lambda ratio was 1.3. The patient is still in remission as of 3 years after the completion of treatment.\",\n",

The pain was described as intermittent lasting minutes to hours. She also noted soreness in the suprapubic area and bloating. Follow-up MRI revealed a benign-appearing multilocular urachal cyst with thin nonenhancing septations as depicted in Figures 1 and 2. On cystoscopy, the bladder appeared normal. However, palpation of the tender abdominal area correlated cystoscopically with the dome of the bladder in the region of the urachal remnant. She opted for cyst removal in an attempt to alleviate her symptoms and reduce the risk of reinfection or malignant transformation.\\nThe patient was positioned in the steep Trendelenburg position and an 18F three-way Foley catheter was inserted. We insufflated the abdomen supraumbilically using a Veress needle. The procedure was done transperitoneally with port placement similar to a standard robotic prostatectomy. The urachus was divided and the bladder was mobilized from the anterior abdominal wall by incising the peritoneum lateral to the medial umbilical ligaments. The space of Retzius was developed. A flexible cystoscope was placed into the bladder to illuminate the bladder dome and urachal remnant:this video feed was transmitted into the Tile Pro  software of the robot to allow simultaneous cystoscopic visualization through the robotic console illustrated in Figure 3. The urachal cyst was mobilized and skeletonized down to a small neck at its insertion. The detrusor muscle layer was incised with thermal energy just below the neck of the cyst but superficial to the bladder mucosa.

No other comorbidities were found. There was no history of dental procedures or injections of intravenous drugs. At presentation, he was drowsy, pale, and edematous with raised jugular venous pulsation. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate 120/min, and body temperature was 38  C. Cardiac examination revealed soft S1, normal S2 with metallic heart sound. There was no audible murmur. Chest examination revealed bilateral basal crepitations. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at presentation was E3 M5 V4 with no focal neurological deficits. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests showed that Hb was 7.6 gm/dl, WBC 17,500/L, and ESR was 80 mm/hr. The renal parameters were elevated with urea of 65 mg/dl and serum creatinine of 3.0 mg/dl. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) revealed metabolic acidosis. Increased cardiothoracic ratio and features suggestive of pulmonary edema were observed on chest radiography. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The transthoracic echo demonstrated large mobile vegetation of 2 cm x 1.6 cm in size on prosthetic mitral valve (Fig. 3). There was mild paravalvular leak with partial dehiscence, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation, moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, and moderate left ventricular dysfunction. The patient was empirically started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Initially, blood cultures grew MRSA sensitive to only teicoplanin, gentamycin, and linezolid. Fever continued with spikes. Supportive treatment was given in the form of inotropic support, vasodilators, and peritoneal dialysis for rapidly worsening renal dysfunction. By the time, the repeat blood culture could identify the culprit bacteria to be S. maltophilia, the patient died of septicemia and renal dysfunction.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 47-year-old woman, accompanied by her husband, voluntarily visited the psychiatric clinic after 2 months of anxiety, weight loss and sleep problems linked to work stress. The patient complained of constant nervousness, muscular tension, restlessness, sweating, heart palpitations, dizziness, and epigastric discomfort. She has been exhibiting obsessive behavior since adolescence. The patient has no family history of mental disorders or severe physical diseases. Laboratory tests, including complete hemogram, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chlorine), and thyroid function, were all within normal range. For a preliminary diagnosis of anxiety disorder, unspecified, paroxetine 20 mg/d and lorazepam 1.5 mg/d were prescribed. Lorazepam was changed to clonazepam 4 mg/d after one week due to unresolved anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Following a panic attack, the patient visited the emergency department, which revealed hypokalemia (potassium 3.0 mmol/l). She gradually developed depression and delusions as more symptoms appeared, convinced that all physical symptoms were signs of severe organ dysfunction, which led her to have suicidal thoughts. Following a suicide attempt, she was involuntarily admitted to another psychiatric facility. During hospitalization, blood tests revealed persistent hypokalemia and progressive hypothyroidism, which could not be fully explained by inadequate dietary intake. Immunologic markers, including autoantibodies, immunoglobins, and complements, were not remarkable. A CT scan of the head yielded no significant findings. Electroconvulsive therapy and a variety of medications were utilized to treat major depressive episode with nihilistic delusion, as shown in Figure 1. Upon discharge, the patient achieved clinical remission of depression. Nevertheless, anxiety was still present, and an undiscovered physical condition was suspected.\\nAfter presenting to the Department of Endocrinology, the patient underwent an enhanced MRI of the head and found a microadenoma 0.3 cm in diameter to the right side of the lower pituitary gland, as shown in Figure 2. In a further review of symptoms, the patient recalled a rounder face and increased waist circumference prior to anxiety symptoms, and amenorrhea following anxiety symptoms and reduced food intake. Purple striae and buffalo hump were absent, as were signs of secondary diabetes, hypertension, or osteoporosis. Laboratory tests revealed elevated serum free cortisol, ACTH, and 24-h urinary free cortisol (24-h UFC), and the phenomenon that 24-h UFC and serum cortisol was not suppressed after low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, all indicated the diagnosis of CS. Elevated ACTH suggested the possibility of ACTH-dependent CS. Furthermore, bilateral petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS) with desmopressin stimulation test showed inferior petrosal sinus/peripheral (IPS/P) ACTH gradient at baseline as 3.1, and IPS/P ACTH gradient after desmopressin stimulation as 10.6. Taking all of the above into account, the patient was diagnosed with CD and subsequently transferred to the Department of Neurosurgery for pituitary microadenoma resection. Psychiatric medication was not discontinued or reduced until the day of surgery. The day after surgery, the patient developed tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated temperatures, tremors, and strong anxiety. Over the next few days, her condition progressed to hypovolemic shock. She refused to take oral medication and refused to cooperate with verbal responses. Considering that the above-mentioned manifestations are due to postoperative adrenal insufficiency, hydrocortisone supplementation was introduced. All psychiatric medications were resumed to alleviate anxiety. After resumption of medication, extrapyramidal symptoms were observed during psychiatric consultations, which prompted recommendations for tapering psychotropic agents. Before discharge, the patient maintained the preoperative dose of all antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics because her anxiety had not improved.\\nOne week after discharge, the patient was again admitted to the emergency department with a high fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and impaired consciousness. The initial diagnosis was secondary adrenal insufficiency after excluding infection. Physical examination indicated tremor, dysarthria, increased muscle tone in the extremities and neck, and myoclonic manifestations of the lower extremities, all of which could not be fully explained by adrenal insufficiency. A psychiatric follow-up consultation revealed that the patient was still taking multiple antidepressants due to persistent anxiety, raising the possibility of serotonin syndrome. Serotoninergic medications were recommended to be discontinued despite the discovery of normal creatine kinase level, with only clonazepam remaining to treat anxiety. Blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature all decreased to normal the next day, as did muscle spasticity. The patient's subjective anxiety slowly subsided by the time she was discharged 4 weeks later. Clonazepam was gradually replaced by estazolam due to daytime sleepiness. The trajectories of serum cortisol, ACTH, and creatine kinase are shown in Figure 3. During the one-month follow-up after discharge, the patient expressed concern for her health and made plans to eventually resume family and work responsibilities once her condition stabilized.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The first case was of a Japanese man in his mid-30s. His major psychiatric issues included bipolar I disorder, intellectual developmental disorder, and transvestism. Although formal genetic testing was not performed, he showed typical clinical presentation of EDS: skin hyperextensibility, generalized joint hypermobility (which satisfied the two major criteria, as set in 2017), soft and doughy skin including the nose septum and auricular, flexible flatfoot, epicanthal folds on the tongue (which satisfied three minor criteria), and phlebitis in his legs (as an additional symptom). His medical history included fetal asphyxia, pediatric asthma, congenital hip arthritis, for which he had undergone two surgeries at 5 and 20 years of age, and hepatitis C caused by blood transfusion that was performed at the second surgery. Since there was no history of interferon therapy during the 10 years before the first visit to a psychiatrist (at year X), the possibility is remote that he had interferon-associated psychiatric disturbances. His premorbid personality traits included nervousness, obstinance, and incoordination. He had no relatives with EDS. The patient was the second son among three siblings. His father had bipolar disorder and committed suicide when the patient was 13 years old.\\nHe was evaluated for intellectual developmental disorder in his adulthood twice at years X+1 and X+6. His verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) was found to be 67 and 77, performance IQ 69 and 49, and full IQ 66 and 62, respectively. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) and small infarct lesions in the cerebral white matter. The psychological examinations, including the Rorschach test and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory suggested a low degree of autonomy or insight but no abnormality in recognizing himself as male gender.\\nThe patient had experienced sexual trauma, as he had been molested by his father in his elementary-school years. He also experienced bullying by classmates because of his poor academic performance at that time. During this difficult time, the father committed suicide. After his father\\'s death, the patient started exhibiting cross-dressing behavior. There was no particular evidence indicating a correlation between his transvestic behavior and his father\\'s death.\\nDespite his poor academic performance, he was able to graduate from senior high school. After spending 1 year at a training school for persons with disabilities, he secured a clerk position at a general corporation as an employee with disabilities. He first visited a psychiatrist (at year X) because he had started experiencing paranoia in the workplace. The symptom subsided with a low dose of haloperidol but at year X+3, paranoia reappeared along with irritation, insomnia, loss of motivation, hypochondriac symptoms, and depressive mood as his job became more demanding. One month after the relapse, his mood changed to mania with insomnia, anger, irritation, and increased appetite and libido. The patient recovered with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and a 6-month sick leave from his job. However, he again relapsed 3 months after remission was achieved. Since then, his affect has remained cyclic while receiving medical treatment either as an outpatient or inpatient.\\nThe intellectual developmental disorder in this case could have possibly been caused by several factors: (1) EDS, (2) past history of fetal asphyxia, (3) presence of CSP, and (4) others. CSP reportedly occasionally causes intellectual developmental disorder, emotional mood disorders, and schizotypal symptoms in adulthood. Although remarkably enlarged CSP (anteroposterior diameter >= 6 mm) is associated with serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, many patients with less prominent CSP remain asymptomatic. The association between CSP and bipolar disorder is generally weaker than that with schizophrenia; the CSP in this case was not enlarged to the extent that could account for all symptoms.\\nWhile his cross-dressing habit began in childhood, first in private in his room, and persisted in public through adulthood, his behaviors and symptoms did not meet the DSM-5 criteria of gender dysphoria. Although he used complete female attire, including upper and lower undergarments, he did not apply female make up on his face and did not look himself in the mirror when wearing female clothes; moreover, his desire to wear female clothes expired when he received psychological support from a nurse at the Company Health Office. His desire was primarily to wear female clothes and his consideration for a sex-change was secondary to feelings of slight guilt and shame that accompanied the desire for cross-dressing. He did not have intense sexual arousal, distress, or impairment in social life, and thus did not meet the DSM-5 criteria for transvestic disorder.\\nRegarding the relationship between transvestism and mood disorders, cross-dressing is reportedly more remarkable during the manic phase and becomes inconspicuous during the remission phase. In this case, his desire to cross-dress remained consistent in the remission phase of the bipolar disorder, and the cycle of mood symptoms did not affect the degree of cross-dressing to a considerable degree. We considered that his symptoms could be attributable to (a) his mother\\'s overprotectiveness and excessive interference due to his intellectual developmental disorder and EDS, (b) conflict with his older brother when he was in the manic phase, and (c) maladaptation in the job environment and failures in the establishment of human relationships. While patients with intellectual developmental disorder may exhibit the so-called pseudo-transvestism used as a means to fantasize women during masturbation, cross-dressing was the objective per se for this patient. Additionally, because he was more interested in looking at pictures of himself wearing female underwear than in changing his gender, his behavior could have been obsessive/compulsive to some degree in the sense that he was overwhelmingly driven to wear female clothes; by doing so, he considered that he could escape into a fantasy world where he could cope with his desire. Anupama et al. reported three cases of patients who cross-dressed; two had intellectual developmental disorder and one had obsessive-compulsive disorder. Meanwhile, Bowler et al. proposed that patients with intellectual developmental disorder tended to engage in cross-dressing, as it was difficult for them to communicate with the opposite sex, both personally and socially. Although cross-dressing is more frequently observed in patients with intellectual developmental disorder than in the general population, their symptoms subside when they are involved in a relationship, while their preference for brilliant clothing continues.\\nThe family environments during childhood have been carefully studied in relation to transvestism; coldness, high pressure, or weak presence with only few emotional exchanges all have been associated with distorted father images in these patients.\\nThe second case was of a Japanese woman in her late 20s. Her major diagnoses were dissociative identify disorder, gender dysphoria, dysthymia, and anorexia nervosa (restriction type). She had classical EDS with skin hyperextensibility and atrophic scarring, generalized joint hypermobility (which satisfied the second major criterion based on the 2017 criteria), easy bruising, soft and doughy skin, skin fragility and traumatic splitting, complications of joint hypermobility such as pain, and family history (which satisfied the fifth minor criterion). The final diagnosis was straightforward even without genetic testing. She did not have notable past medical history and had nervousness as her premorbid personality trait. Her monozygotic twin sister also had EDS, and except for her twin sister, she also had an older brother; none of her other relatives had EDS or diagnosed psychiatric disorders including gender dysphoria and dissociative identity disorder.\\nThe patient was brought up as older sister in contrast with that another twin sister was treated as younger sister in their family, although they are monozygotic twins. She was prone to injuries and dislocations and had led an infirm life since childhood. In elementary school, she was frequently bullied for her facial scars and suffering from dysthymic status. In addition, as far as the patient could recollect, she started to feel uncomfortable wearing women\\'s clothes in her early elementary-school years. Her mother reacted to the situation by overprotection, imposing rules to prohibit the patient from playing outdoors or behaving as a boy and restricting her behavior inside the house. Compared with her mother\\'s parental control, her father was judgmental against her \"laziness\" because she was unable to overcome her dysthymic personality/character and secure regular employment after graduating from high school.\\nShe was aware of having dissociative identity disorder since childhood based on her recollections of first experiencing a personality change at the age of 5 years. The original personality (A) corresponded to a patient with anorexia nervosa and was mainly dormant. She was aware of two male personalities present most of the time; personality (B) who oversaw meals and personal activities and personality (C) who oversaw contact with others (including during consultation with the psychiatrist). The replacement personalities appeared depending on the circumstances; several male personalities, including (B) and (C), dominated during housekeeping, eating, and social encounters, while the female personalities were likely to surface when the patient was required to dress and behave in a female manner during her school years and, currently, those personalities appear to be integrated as personality (D), emerging only when the patient is concerned with feminine hygiene during bathing and menstruation. In the past, she presented with a larger number of personalities, but they were consolidated to the relatively few personalities mentioned above, presumably as a coping mechanism in an effort to maintain wellness.\\nWhen limb movement paralysis and inability to open her eyes appeared at the age of mid-20s, a physical examination was performed at a hospital as her first major psychiatric consultation (at year Y). Meanwhile, no physical abnormalities were detected and she was diagnosed with dissociative movement disorder. Since then, she has been occasionally treated as an outpatient at the psychiatric department of the university hospital. Despite her main complaint of excessive dietary restriction and self-induced vomiting based on her desire to lose weight, psychiatric treatment was intermittent. She had strong desire for social support, self-acceptance, and integration of a male identity. To fulfil what she considered were the requirements of a male identity, she habitually used male public restrooms. Finally, she received a first psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria based on the DSM-5 criteria, with the disorder involving years of marked incongruence between the self-referenced and assigned genders. At year Y+2, she relocated without her parents\\' permission to the house of a friend with dissociative identity disorder who she knew through the Social Network Service. She was then transferred to another hospital located near her home at year Y+3, where the psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria was confirmed based on the DSM-5 criteria.\\nThe difference in intellectual level between the two patients may have led to different phenotypes, hypochondriac behavior in Case 1 and dissociative identity disorder in Case 2. Patients with dissociative identity disorder often experience considerable stress during early and late childhood, which may include (a) bullying from schoolmates and siblings, (b) restrictions in self-expression by overly controlling parents, (c) child abuse including neglect, and (d) mental trauma caused by accidents or other incidents. Factors (a) to (c), as well as (d), render individuals susceptible to trauma and were present and constituted high risk of dissociative identity disorder in Case 2. The specific personalities of dissociative identity disorder were deemed to stem from the clinical features of EDS. Primary personality (A) had anorexia nervosa, possibly influenced by insufficiency of maternal separation from early childhood because of her mothers\\' overprotectiveness and excessive interference driven by her concern for the high risk of trauma associated with EDS. Eating disorder is a symbolic disease mainly observed in women, and the patient attempted to deny her femininity through her gender dysphoria. Although she reported experiencing a strong sense of discomfort and disgust for being treated as a woman, she also understood the risks of surgery because of her EDS and did not consider a sex-change operation. As a compensatory mechanism against these feelings, the male personalities (B) and (C) became dominant, overseeing meals to counter anorexia nervosa, which is a symbol of femininity, controlling physical health, and acting as a form of psychological coping mechanism to protect the patient against the discomfort of gender dysphoria. It is difficult to discern whether anorexia nervosa or gender dysphoria was the primary disorder. To summarize, the prolongation of her dissociative identity disorder maintained her original personality at a dormant state. In fact, the memory rupture and amnesia are well recognized in dissociative identity disorder and did not occur with personalities (B) and (C), which retained almost all the memories of the other personalities.',\n",

       "    'case_text': 'A 54-year-old male patient was referred by the physiotherapist with 1 year history of anterior left knee pain. He had sustained a patellar tendon tear, requiring surgical repair 30 years ago. Clinical examination was mainly suggestive of patellofemoral arthritis. This was confirmed on plain radiographs and MRI. A knee arthroscopy was performed that showed grade 2 changes in the trochlea with grade 3 changes on the patella. At six-month review the patient reported no significant improvement in symptoms; he was therefore listed for patellofemoral joint replacement (PFJR). Following his surgery using the Zimmer Gender Solutions Patello-Femoral Joint his symptoms progressively worsened (Figure 1).\\nThe patient was systemically well; however, his mobility and left knee range of motion worsened to the extent that he required 2 crutches. His infection screen, including full blood count, CRP, and plasma viscosity, was not raised. All possible nonoperative measures were exhausted therefore we decided to perform a single stage revision to a total knee replacement. Intraoperatively, a large cyst was discovered under the femoral component. This necessitated a change of plan to a 2-stage revision. Multiple samples were taken and sent for microbiological and histological study. The cyst was curetted and packed with bone graft and a cement spacer was placed (Figure 2).\\nThe microbiological studies were negative and histopathological studies showed nonspecific inflammatory response. In the absence of any other cause of implant failure metal allergy was considered. The patient was referred to the allergy clinic for further investigation. A patch test was strongly positive for nickel allergy. This patient went on to have a 2nd stage revision using a nickel-free revision knee system (Figure 3), and at 6-month follow-up showed dramatic improvement in his symptoms.',\n",

He is married, well-educated, and retired (used to work as a teacher and civil servant). He does not smoke, does not take drugs, and drinks alcohol in moderation (<140 ml of ethanol/week). We investigated his daily habits, eating preferences, physical activities, etc., and there was nothing special except the handstand concerned in this study. The participant was healthy 40 years ago, and he did handstand exercise because he wanted to stay fit.\\nThe participant designed the passive handstand device. The device includes a V-shaped support frame, a high bracket for handstand, and a foot retainer (Figure 1). When he was young, he used the device to exercise for approximately 30 min at a time, but because of his busy schedule and many business trips, he was sometimes unable to exercise on time. When he retired at age 60, he persisted in doing handstand exercises once daily for only 10 min. When using the device, he did not experience discomfort.\\nWe quantified health through physical and auxiliary examinations, including imaging studies to evaluate the participant's cerebrovascular, spinal health, facial aging, mental health, and visual acuity. Assessments were performed every 10 years. In the first 20 years of follow-up, due to the underdeveloped medical technology and the lack of auxiliary examination at that time, physical examination was mainly used.\\nIn 2021, spinal health evaluation comprised physical examination at each follow-up and magnetic resonance imaging. At the 20-year follow-up, we examined the participant's cervical spine using radiography. Cerebrovascular assessment consisted of computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. We compared his current cerebrovascular condition (assessed by magnetic resonance angiography) with that 10 years prior (assessed by computed tomography angiography) to confirm the effect of long-term handstand suspension on cerebrovascular elasticity. We also evaluated his cerebrovascular health by measuring his blood pressure before, during, and after using the device.\\nWe took pictures of the participant and compared them with those taken more than a decade prior to assess the rate of facial aging. Facial aging was assessed according to the severity of eyelid pouches and facial wrinkles. The severity of eyelid pouches was categorized as no pouches, mild pouches (slight herniation of the lower orbital septum fat accompanied by slight relaxation of the lower eyelid skin), moderate pouches (moderate herniation of the lower orbital septum fat accompanied by moderate relaxation of the lower eyelid skin), and severe pouches (severe herniation of the lower orbital septum fat or severe relaxation of the lower eyelid skin). The severity of facial wrinkles was evaluated using the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale.\\nSince 1991, the visual acuity of this man was measured according to the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol using a LogMAR chart. The test results of the better eye were expressed in logarithmic units ranging from 1 (20/200) to -0 3 (20/10), with lower values indicating better vision.\\nMoreover, since 1991, we have assessed his mental health and cognitive function using the Mini Mental State Examination scale.\\nThe sponsor (Science and Technology Innovation Talent Team Project of Guizhou Province, China) provided financial support in the collection and interpretation of data.\\nThe patient and the public were involved in the design, reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.

       "    'case_text': 'A 74-year-old Japanese man with end-stage renal failure, precipitated by an unknown primary disease, had been maintained on hemodialysis since 2018. In April 2019, he was diagnosed with advanced sigmoid colon cancer and underwent a colectomy for the same. The pathological stage of the tumor was confirmed as IIIC (T4aN2M0). Although the patient was informed that there was a high chance of cancer recurrence, he did not wish to receive adjuvant therapy. Follow-up computed tomography scan performed in December 2019 revealed multiple lung and liver metastases, considered to be recurrent colon cancers. The molecular biology of the tumor was as follows; microsatellite instability, MSS; KRAS mutation, exon 2 (G12D); BRAF mutation, wild type; UGT1A1 mutation, absent ( Table 1 ). Thereafter, the patient was treated with modified FOLFOX6 as first-line chemotherapy in April 2020. Unfortunately, the liver metastases increased after 21 cycles of treatment, and in April 2021, the patient was referred to our hospital for further treatment. Physical and blood examinations revealed no notable changes, and his performance status was 0 at admission. Laboratory data obtained on admission to our hospital and the genetic information of the cancer are shown in  Table 1 .\\nThe body surface area of the patient was 1.46 m2, and he was treated with FOLFIRI [irinotecan 120 mg/m2 intravenously infused over 120 min (80% of the standard dose in Japan), with levofolinate 200 mg/m2 over 120 min, followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 intravenously infuse over 46 h (without 5-FU bolus)] plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously infused over 30 min) every 2 weeks. Hemodialysis was performed on the second day for convenience and scheduling following FOLFIRI therapy and repeated 3 times per week. To measure serum bevacizumab concentrations, blood samples were collected at five time points: pretreatment (defined as day 0), before hemodialysis on day 2, day 4, day 6, and day 8. For days 4, 6, and 8, blood samples were obtained just before the start of dialysis. All blood samples were centrifuged immediately after collection at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the obtained serum was further centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The centrifuged samples were stored in a freezer until measurement using a bevacizumab ELISA Kit (#ab237642; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).\\nIt was observed that the serum concentration of bevacizumab increased to 56.3 microg/mL on day 2 but then decreased over time regardless of hemodialysis; the serum concentration on day 8 decreased to 37.1 microg/mL ( Figure 1A ). At the fifth cycle after treatment initiation, neutropenia (grade 4) was observed, and thus we reduced the dosage of 5-FU to 2000 mg/m2 and that of irinotecan to 100 mg/m2. However, no bevacizumab-related AEs were observed. Regarding therapeutic effects, stable disease was maintained for 7.5 months under treatment with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. Thereafter, the disease showed progression with elevated tumor markers and increased size and number of lung and liver metastases ( Figure 1B ), following which the treatment regimen was changed to trifluridine/tipiracil. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effect was poor, and the treatment was transitioned from chemotherapy to best supportive care.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 57-year-old man with history of double LTx in October 2019 (lung donated voluntarily with written informed consent, and that this was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Istanbul) for bronchiectasis secondary to CVID. He was supplemented by subcutaneous immunoglobulin G and had a prior history of pan-sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. The immunosuppressive regimen included induction with basiliximab and maintenance with steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. After transplant, the patient rapidly developed severe recurrent bronchopulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa despite several repeated associative antibiotic therapies and continuous inhaled colistin (Figure 1, description of the clinical course and therapies). The patient's respiratory function progressively deteriorated (obstructive pattern) leading to severe chronic respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation associated with recurrence of bronchiectasis on chest CT scan (Figure 1). \\nAs a result of antibiotic pressure, an XDR strain emerged, which was only susceptible to colistin, cefiderocol, amikacin, and gentamicin. The use of aminoglycosides was challenging to manage due to side effects with multiple episodes of acute kidney injury that evolved to severe chronic kidney failure and hearing loss.\\nWithin the first-year post-transplant, steroids were rapidly tapered, azithromycin introduced (250 mg given once daily) as a treatment of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), the mycophenolate mofetil stopped and never reintroduced to minimize the infection risk (antimetabolite agent), and cyclosporin A finally tapered to 10 mg per day resulting in an undetectable residual rate of blood cyclosporin A because the infection was not controlled despite the mycophenolate mofetil stopped. No acute rejection was found on the repeated lung biopsies. We enhanced the immunoglobulin supplementation with IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulins (Pentaglobin , Biotest, Dreieich, Germany), Figure 2. \\nFrom that adaptation of the immunosuppressive regimen, we managed to obtain clinical stability (oxygen requirement decreased to 1 L/min, no sepsis, decreased sputum) but every attempt to stop the antibiotic treatment failed.\\nIn this context of therapeutic impasse, a decolonization strategy with bacteriophage therapy (BT) has been considered. Pherecydes Pharma (Pherecydes Pharma, Romainville, France, https://www.pherecydes-pharma.com/en/) owns a collection of anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages. In the scope of compassionate use and in agreement with the French health authorities, the strains isolated from the patient were sent to the company, which performed a phagogram (equivalent to an antibiogram but with phages). Among the phages produced in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and that were available as ready-to-use by the company, PP1450, PP1792, and PP1797 have shown activity on the patient's strains (Figure 3). Multisite samples revealed the presence of the XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the stool and the nose. For that reason, we associated inhaled phage therapy (2 inhalations a day using vibrating mesh, Aeroneb , Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) and oral ingestion of phages 2 times a day for 7 days (Figure 4).  \\nThe phages were supplied by Pherecydes Pharma as well as the stability data which allowed us to prepare the treatment for 2 days (4 administrations). Four mL of each phage at 10Log were collected and completed with 48 mL of a saline solution. From that mixture, nebulizations were performed with 8 mL and oral ingestion with 6 mL of the solution. A sterility test was performed with 1 mL of each prepared solution.\\nBecause phages survival is favor by basic condition, we treated the patient with double dose of proton pump inhibitor to maximize the efficacy. We had thought of a fecal transplantation to decolonize the digestive tract. The request was refused due to a shortage of stool available in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. In June 2021, the strain was susceptible to cefiderocol and colistin. Thus, we associated these antibiotics with the BT, Figure 4. Oral and nasal decolonization were performed with chlorhexidine 4%, 4 times a day for 14 days. Daily skin decolonization was performed with chlorhexidine 2% for 14 days. The patient was isolated in a single bedroom with contact and droplet precaution. Personal belongings have been taken out of the room and isolated (including clothes, computer, and mobile phone). Daily bio-cleaning with disinfectant were performed. Finally, the patient was moved to another room at the end of the BT.\\nDuring the BT, the patient's respiratory conditions improved (less sputum production) allowing a weaning from oxygen supplementation. At the end of the first cycle of BT, XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa was still identified in sputum and stool. We sent new samples to Pherecydes Pharma laboratory who confirmed that the strain was still susceptible to bacteriophages initially tested. As we were waiting for the second cycle of BT, the patient presented a new acute respiratory failure related to the worsening of the bronchopulmonary infection, despite no discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy, that required mechanical ventilation. The second cycle of BT was administrated through bronchoscopy and by nasogastric tube with the same protocol as described for the first cycle. The patient presented a severe obstructive pattern on the ventilator, and despite aggressive intensive care and protective ventilation, the patient progressed to multi-organ failure and died at 24 months post-LTx. For the first time, all samples collected (rectal smear, bronchial aspiration, and bronchoalveolar lavage) were interpreted as sterile from day 5 of the second cycle of BT (and confirmed the days after till the death).\\nIn summary, we could observe first clinical stability (low oxygen supplementation and no more sepsis) after adapting the immunosuppressive regimen and mainly after initiating the IgM/IgA-enriched immunoglobulins, but without the possibility to stop the antibiotic treatment. And second, we could obtain sterilization of the different sites that were previously infected or colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa after the second cycle of BT, despite the fatal outcome.\",\n",

She later developed a chronic ulcer on the scalp that, after investigation, was indicative of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) or pyoderma-like. She had a previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis and PG on both legs in 2003. She was treated with cyclosporine, infliximab, clofazimine, doxycycline, and intralesional triamcinolone injections with varying results for over four years. PG was finally controlled in mid-2007. She remained asymptomatic until March 2020, when intense and sudden pain on the vertex and left parietal region developed. Multiple tender papules with peripheral erythema were present. Although no vesicles were found, a tentative diagnosis of cephalic herpes zoster was suspected. Despite treatment with valacyclovir and pregabalin, symptoms increased, and papules evolved into multiple, deep, ulcerated lesions with a central necrotic scab and undermining border. Expression yielded a significant amount of purulent secretion. Skin biopsy findings were of an ulcer with exuberant granulation tissue. Histology study was performed on the material obtained while curetting one of the large abscesses rather than by a wedge excision of the border. Although the vertex aspect on the scalp suggested an erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp, histology was more consistent with PG. Attempts to obtain microbiological cultures were twice negative.\\nPrevious comorbidities include IgA multiple myeloma in remission for the past seven years and remission of pulmonary tuberculosis treated with triple therapy 18 years ago. In the process of choosing a proper therapy, the Quantiferon test was performed, which was negative. After a short period of use of oral Dapsone, the disease progressed. Due to the previous history of tuberculosis and possible contra-indications for anti-TNF alpha therapy, she was started on baricitinib, a novel Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, 4 mg orally daily, taking into consideration the past attempts with more conservative approaches mentioned above. The idea of using JAK inhibitors was considered in the case of failed treatments, which proved helpful. Lesions started to improve, and by seven days, no new lesions were identified. Complete regression was achieved after five weeks, leaving a depressed scar (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).\\nCase 2 A 59-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis since 2011, controlled with methotrexate 15 mg/week, developed in 2018 a leg skin ulcer for which PG was diagnosed. Healing was obtained with dressings and MTX maintenance.\\nIn 2019, another PG occurred on the left leg and ankle; treatment consisted of prednisone 0.7 mg/kg/d associated with MTX 20 mg/week. PG resolved in 4 months; corticotherapy was gradually tapered, and MTX was maintained. Severe Cushing's syndrome signs were noted, impairing quality of life.\\nIn 2020, another outbreak of PG compromised the right leg; methotrexate was suspended, and baricitinib 4 mg/day was introduced, with the lesion's healing in 3 months presented in the photos (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).\",\n",

Also, most of the time, he did not initiate communication unless to satisfy his needs. The others asked questions to communicate with him. Furthermore, he was behind his age in his language competencies compared to his age group.\\nIt should be mentioned that none of the participants received other emotion recognition interventions during our study period.\\nThe RSE setup, i.e., a 50 cm high table with two robots and a tablet, was set in a 3 x 3 meters room. The tablet was placed on a stand between the robots to display the images or run the designed games. The game was developed using the Unity game engine to show the desired emotions. A camera was positioned at one corner of the room to record the overall view of the setting so that we can analyze the sessions later. In each session, there was a psychologist who was overseeing the whole process to make sure everything run smoothly and according to general therapy rules. Furthermore, his feedback was collected for future improvements. Besides the therapist, the main researcher was present during all the sessions making sure that the sessions run according to the plan. The overall structure of the designed RSE can be seen in Figure 3.\\nTo investigate the effect of the proposed RSE in teaching facial expressions (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear) to children with autism, a single case A-B-A design experiment with a generalization probe across novel stimuli and setting was conducted. The A-B-A technique is a reversal design that has three phases: 1) Phase A or the first baseline in which no treatment is introduced, and the behavior is evaluated, 2) Phase B in which the treatment is introduced, 3) Phase A (that we called it A\\') or second baseline which is a return to the baseline by stopping the treatment. In this technique, the effectiveness of a proposed protocol is evaluated using multiple measures to see the changes by comparing Phase A to Phase B and then to Phase A\\'.\\nWithin 1 week after baseline phase (A), a familiarization session was conducted to introduce the robots to the participants and reduce their novelty effect. In this session, the session conductor invited the participants to become familiar with the two robots. Then the robots started greeting the participants, introduced themselves, and asked the participants\\' names, ages, and favorite activities to make a sense of friendship. Then the robots started playing with a robotic ball, called Sphero, to attract the participants. In this familiarization session, the participants were free to play with the robots. Within 1 week after this session, the training phase (B) was started.\\nBefore starting the training sessions, we evaluated the participants\\' abilities in recognizing emotions in three sessions for 2 weeks. The images were selected from the Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) set and Radboud Faces Database to have both adults\\' and children\\'s images. Twenty images, 10 males and 10 females, were randomly selected from these datasets, including 5 images for every facial expression. The order of the images was also random to avoid memorizing the images based on the order. Each participant sat on a chair in front of a laptop computer and the session conductor presented the images one by one and asked the participant \"what is her/his feeling?\", then she waited for 3s. If the participant did not look at the images, she delivered the question up to two additional times. No feedback was provided on the responses of the participants. At the end of the task, the participants were praised for their attentiveness. The participants scored one for each right answer and zero for each wrong answer or lack of an answer.\\nThe first therapy session was started 1 week after the familiarization session. A fixed protocol was given to the robots\\' operator to run all the sessions. Thirty-two images of 4 emotions, i.e. 8 images per expression, were chosen to be displayed on the tablet. These images were different from the images that were used in the baseline phases to prevent children from memorizing them. The schematic of the familiarization and Phase B can be seen in Figure 4.\\n1. Robots greet the participant.\\n2. If the participant shows a tendency to speak to the robots, the robots answer him/her and give them feedback with laughing, movement, and funny voices.\\n3. The robots invite the participant to sit on a chair and watch them play.\\n4. The game is run for the robots to correctly name the emotions.\\n5. The robots start the conversation about the current image and name the emotion.\\n6. Another image is displayed, and this process repeats until the termination of the game (going back to step 5).\\n7. If the session ends, the robots say goodbye to the participant and invite him/her to the next session.\\nBefore starting the therapy, the operator practiced the scenario several times. For all steps of the scenario, potential interaction sentences were determined. The scenario and the overall setup were tested by 5 members of our laboratory. They gave us feedback about the speed and ability of the operator to run the system. We used their comments to run the scenario smoother and more naturally. The steps of the scenario are as follows. \\nIf there is any problem with the interaction that would cause any disruptive behavior the session conductor reacted accordingly.\\nIn step 5, RoboParrot asked Red \"what is this boy/girl/man/woman feeling?\", then Red answered the question and explained why that face convey that feeling, such as \"he is laughing so he is happy\". Also, the robot may explain the same thing from the effect point of view of the emotion, i.e., \"When we are happy, we may laugh\". As a verbal reward, Roboparrot praised Red saying \"bravo\" to reinforce his correct answer. Furthermore, a star or a flower was displayed on the screen as a visual reinforcement for Red. To ensure that the participants do not miss the named emotion, one of the robots would repeat the named emotion again. Every training session took a maximum of 30 min. A view of the experimental set-up is shown in Figure 5.\\nIt should be mentioned that we had designed several questions and sentences based on our previous studies such as \"how are you? How old are you? sit on the chair, listen to me, what is your name? and I am fine\", to interact with children if they showed interest to interact. For instance, at the start of a conversation, P2 asked one of the robots \"are you talking to your friend, is it possible to talk to me too?\" or asked them \"are you playing together\". Also, P4 hugged and touched them and asked their names. In such cases, the robots answered the participants. These behaviors mostly occurred at the beginning or end of the sessions.\\nAt the end of each session, the participants were taken to another room and the researcher evaluated their emotion recognition capabilities, with a similar process to the baseline phase. Every participant had one or two training sessions weekly with at least 3 days gap, so the whole training phase took 8 weeks.\\nThree sessions were conducted for the second baseline, which was similar to the first baseline. The second baseline was done 2 weeks after the training phase.\\nA generalization probe was conducted 2 weeks after the second baseline. In this session, a similar evaluation to the baselines was conducted with 20 new images that were randomly selected from Radboud and CAFE datasets. In other words, we wanted to show that the subjects did not only learn the emotions in the images used in the therapy sessions, but they learned to recognize the four emotions in a set of new images. This evaluation was designed and performed in a room different from the therapy room to see if children could generalize the newly-learned skills to unseen stimulus items and setting.\\nTo evaluate the effects of the proposed RES on children\\'s emotion recognition skills, we used descriptive analysis, i.e., visualization of the gathered data from the sessions, and a non-parametric rank order correlation effect size measure, called TAU-U. This method helps interpret single-case experiments. Using graphs to show each participant\\'s data point in all sessions, enables us to track the level, trend, and changes within and between phases. Using these two methods together can make the evaluation more reliable.\\nThe TAU-U non-parametric analysis is a useful and desirable method for single-case experiments to calculate and illustrate the effects of therapy on both within-phase trends and across-phase differences separately. It considers all pairwise comparisons of non-overlap points in a time-forward direction similar to the NAP method (non-overlap of all pairs). However, NAP is insensitive to the trend of the data and cannot consider the pre-existing trend of the baseline which would be an indicator of the participants\\' improvement even without intervention. The pairwise comparisons in TAU-U result in three decisions of Pos (positive), Neg (negative), or Tie. Pos shows a score improvement and Neg shows a score decrement from Phase A to B. TAU-U is calculated based on the number of Pos and Neg pairwise points. It also considers controlling undesirable baseline monotonic trend with baseline correction by calculating Tau-UA vs. B-trend A In this study three TAU-U calculations were considered: 1) Tau-Utrend A to control the trend of baseline, 2) Tau-UA vs. B to evaluate the effect of the training, and 3) Tau-UA vs. A\\' to compare the second baseline with the first baseline to examine the sustained effect of the training. When Tau-Utrend A >= 0.4, which means that there is a trend in the baseline, a baseline trend control is needed to remove its effect in the analysis process. The conditions for interpreting TAU-U are as follows: 1) above 0.8 is a very large change, 2) between 0.6 and 0.8 is a large change, 3) between 0.2 and 0.6 is a moderate change, and 4) 0.2 and below is considered a small change.\\nIn addition to the above evaluation approaches, the mothers of participants were interviewed at the end of RSE therapy to see if they had observed any changes in their children\\'s abilities in recognizing and expressing emotions.',\n",

X-ray studies showed an occipitalized CO-C1 and congential C2-3 fusion; both contributed to an irreducible AAD resulting in cervico-medullary junction compression. Of interest, the C1 sagittal inferior facet angles measured 138 . The computed tomography (CT) angiogram clearly defined the anomalous course of the V3 segments of both VA; the VA exited from the C2 transverse foramen, took a lateral course toward the C1 transverse foramen, but instead of traversing the C1 foramen, turned inferiorly and coursed medially beneath the C1 posterior arch before piercing the dura [Figure 1]. Therefore, both VA lay posterior to the inferior facet of C1 (3D CT; Figure 1).\\nAs the patient was incompletely reduced with traction, surgical intervention was warranted. The C1-2 joints were approached posteriorly, and both C2 nerve root ganglia were cut to expose the anomalous VAs just anterior to it. In order to avoid inadvertent injury to the VAs, the loops crossing the C1 facets were carefully exposed; the posterior wedge of the C2 and anterior wedge of the C1 facets were drilled making the inferior facet angle flat in order to reduce the AAD. Spacers and bone grafts were placed in the C1-2 joint spaces. Next, the VAs were gently retracted inferiorly to insert the C1 lateral mass screws, which were sufficiently tightened to leave enough space between the screw head and the facet surface for the VA; the postoperative CT also showed adequate reduction [Figure 2 and 3]. Postoperatively, the child did well, becoming ambulatory, and 4 months later, the CT exhibited good bony fusion.',\n",

The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and was started on aggressive IV hydration and IV ceftriaxone as a treatment for severe sepsis syndrome. The source of the sepsis was thought to be a urinary tract infection as the urine culture grew Kluyvera ascorbata and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B), and both organisms were sensitive to ceftriaxone. The hospital course was prolonged and complicated. During the first 24 hours, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and was started on IV amiodarone and heparin drip.

The left nasal cavity was normal, the orbital floors were free, and the examination of the cervical area was normal. The computed tomography scan found thickening tissue of the right nasal cavity remaining confined without any suspicious abnormality (Figure 1). No magnetic resonance imaging was done, because of the presence of the defibrillator.

On physical examination, he appeared lethargic, while his vital signs were still stable. Both iliac fossae were tender, and crepitus was felt along the anteromedial aspect of the left thigh. The neurovascular status of the bilateral lower limbs was intact. Blood investigations showed lymphocytosis. A CT scan was done urgently and revealed retroperitoneal collection from the L1/L2 vertebral body and the collection was extending to bilateral iliacus muscle. However, it extended beyond the iliopsoas insertion on the left side. The CT scan images revealed also the destruction of the first and second lumbar vertebrae (Figure 1). \\nThe patient was resuscitated adequately and, then, taken for surgical intervention on the same day as the presentation. Extensive incision and drainage were done bilaterally. Intraoperatively, more than 1,000 mL pus was drained, and the extensive slough tissue was debrided. The collection was found to unusually breach the deep fascia and extent into the left adductor canal (Figure 2). \\nDuring this setting, a diagnostic laparoscopy was also performed, and intra-abdominal involvement was ruled out. Specimens were sent for culture and sensitivity intraoperatively, which later revealed the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). The patient was treated with intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. A repeat CT scan was done one week later and showed a residual collection. The patient was taken in for another surgical drainage, while intravenous antibiotics were continued. Subsequent repeat scan revealed only minimal residual collection, while there was no worsening of vertebral bony destruction. Although the collection was visualized to involve the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies with bony destruction, no surgical interventions were performed for the spine, as the patient did not have neurological deficits and there was no worsening of the spinal column during treatment with intravenous antibiotics. \\nEventually, the patient improved clinically and was deemed fit for discharge. He was followed in the outpatient setting. However, eight months later, the patient was re-admitted for a left hip intramuscular abscess for which left hip drainage of the intramuscular abscess and arthrotomy washout was done, revealing about 40 mL of pus. During the same admission, the patient was also treated for lung empyema and bilateral pleural effusion by the surgical and medical team, respectively. Culture and sensitivity of specimens sent intraoperatively yielded growth of K. pneumoniae and he was treated with intravenous meropenem. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed to sepsis due to the deep-seated intramuscular abscess and lung empyema. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 18-year-old patient with a history of Matched-Unrelated-Donor Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (MUD-PBSCT) was admitted to the hospital because of renal failure. In November 2007 the patient was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T cells (T-ALL) at another institution, where he was treated with induction therapy according to Hyper-CVAD Protocol (Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 3 hours every 12 hours for six doses on days 1 through 3, with mesna given by continuous infusion, vincristine 2 mg IV days 4 and 11, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 4, and dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1 through 4 and 11 through 14) and was refractory when he presented in our department of hematology/oncology. The diagnosis of T-ALL has been confirmed, immunophenotype precursor T-ALL (CD7, CD3, CD2, CD4, and CD8 pos), cytogenetic 46, XY, Fluorescein in sito hybridisation (FISH) analysis 87% deletion of p16 on the chromosome 9 region p21. He was then treated with induction therapy according to the German multicenter ALL protocol (GMALL) achieving only reduction of blasts after Induction II. Briefly, the induction in GMALL protocol was composed of eight cytotoxic drugs administered sequentially in two phases over an 8-week period. During the first 4 weeks (phase I), the patient received 60 mg/m2 prednisolone PO daily (days 1 through 28) plus 45 mg/m2 daunorubicin and 2 mg vincristine IV weekly (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). L-asparaginase (5 000 U/m2) was administered IV daily (days 15 through 28). In the second 4 weeks (phase II), the patient received two doses of 650 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide IV (days 29, 43, and 57) together with 60 mg/m2 6-mercaptopurine PO daily (days 29 through 57) and four courses of 75 mg/m2 cytarabine IV (days 31 through 34, 38 through 41, 45 through 48, and 52 through 55). He was then treated with nelarabine and achieved complete remission (CR1) following MUD-PBSCT. The conditioning consisted of total body irradiation (TBI), 12 Gy, given fractionated 2 times daily for three days, from day -6 to day -4, and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -3 and -2 (total dose 120 mg/kg b.w.). A Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) identical unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells were infused on day 0. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of thymoglobulin (2 mg/kg b.w. daily, from day -3 to -1, total dose of 6 mg/kg b.w.), cyclosporine 5 mg/kg starting on day -1, and methotrexate at days +1, +3, +6, and +11 intravenously 15 mg absolute. The bone marrow puncture on day +28 showed a complete hematological remission with 100% donor chimerism. Along with the regeneration of white blood cells the patient developed a methylprednisolone-dependent GvHD of the skin and gastrointestinal, grade II. After 10 days the therapy with corticosteroids could be discontinued by rapid improvement of the GvHD-related symptoms. Under the therapy with corticosteroids the patient developed a herpes simplex related oesophagitis on day 21 post transplant which was treated with 30 g daily over 5 days i.v. immunoglobulin and foscarnet 90 mg/kg b.w. divided in 2 doses. On day +28 after PBSCT the patient developed a hemorrhagic cystitis with high urine titers of BK polyoma virus and CMV infection. A therapy with ganciclovir was initiated for ten days. Under treatment with ganciclovir, CMV infection improved, and the treatment with cidofovir was started (1 mg/kg b.w. for two weeks). The BK Virus viruria and viremia improved, and the patient received ganciclovir treatment for additional two weeks (Figure 1). The cyclosporine level was from 200 to 150 from day 0 to day 30, followed with level of 100 from day 30 to day 40 post transplant, and level of 50 from day 40 to day 50. The cyclosporine has been discontinued on day +70 after MUD-PBSCT in absence of acute GvHD and as recommended in GMALL protocol. On day +48 after PBSCT a cystoscopy with a continuous intravesical saline irrigation was started and discontinued 2 weeks later. The patient symptoms improved, and creatinine levels returned to normal. He was discharged from hospital; his medications at the time of discharge included ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily), valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily), fluconazole (200 mg daily), folate, and cotrimoxazole twice weekly for prophylaxis of pneumocystis carinii infection.\\nOver the next year the levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine gradually rose (Table 1), which was attributed to drug toxicity. cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was stopped. Cyclosporine was discontinued since no signs of GvHD were present 6 months after PBSCT. The serum creatinine level was 153 mumol/l (Table 1). Routine urinary diagnostic measures were carried out and showed inconsistent microhematuria. BK viruria was negative in this period. \\nOn admission, blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg with 90 heart beats per minute, a temperature of 36.4 C, and an oxygen saturation of 99% when the patient was breathing ambient air. The lungs were clear, the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. The complete blood count and levels of serum electrolytes, liver function tests, and levels of total protein and albumin were normal. The urine sediment was not nephritic but contained a small amount of leukocytes indicating an inflammatory process such as cystitis. Results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. \\nUltrasonographic examination of the kidneys showed bilateral hydronephrosis stage III-IV (Figure 2(a)). In addition, decreased echotexture bladder tumours were seen (Figure 2(b)). The patient was presented to the urologist. Cystoscopy with urethrography has shown exophytic bladder tumours in both ostii. The extirpation of the tumours was performed and sent off for pathological examination. In addition a double-J catheter was placed. The hydronephrosis of the left kidney improved immediately and improved to grade II in the right kidney. For histological examination tissues were formalin-fixed overnight and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin & Eosin staining of 5 micrometer sections was performed following standard procedures. \\nThe pathohistology of the specimen showed a chronic cystical urocystitis with bleedings (Figure 3(a)). Tissue probes of both ureters were stained for SV40 large T antigen (clone pAb416, Oncogene Science, Boston, Mass, USA; dilution 1 : 100, antigen retrieval and amplification with catalyzed system amplification, Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The reactions were detected by means of the streptavidin-biotin method and were revealed using diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. In all tissue probes immunohistochemistry for large T antigen was negative (Figure 3(b)). \\nThe patient has undergone double-J catheter controls and changes every two months and is doing well 2 years after PBSCT and 1 year after operative extirpation of tumours. The last control was in April 2010 (Table 1).\\nTwo different regions of the BKV genome were amplified by PCR, VP2 in serum and urine, and large T antigen from tissue biopsies.\\nNucleic acids were extracted from 200 microliter blood or urine using magnetic beads (MagNA Pure LC total NA isolation kit, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions while from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). VP2 primers lead to amplification of a 131 bp fragment. PCR reaction was carried out in 20 microliter capillaries containing master mix (6 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, USA)) and 10 picoM of each primer (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany), 3 picoM of each hybridization probe (5'-GGCTGCTGCTGCCACAGGATTTTC-FL (probe 1) and 5'LC Red640-GTAGCTGAAATTGCTGCTGGAGAG-ph (probe 2), 0.25 mM dNTP's (Roche)), and 1U Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Target DNA was added in a volume of 5 microliters. Two negative and 4 positive controls in different concentrations were included into each run performed on a LightCycler 1.0 instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) under the following conditions: initial denaturation and activation of hot-start enzyme at 95 C for 30 s, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for 0 s, annealing of primers at 58 C for 10 s, and primer extension at 72 C for 20 s. Fluorescence was monitored by single acquisition during the annealing phase of each PCR cycle and channel setting F2/F1 (640 nm/530 nm). Differentiation of BK virus amplicons from JC virus depends on the binding of the probe 2, which perfectly matches JC virus but differs at the two underlined positions from BK virus. Thus binding to BK virus results in a shifted melting curve (61.5 C for BK versus 63.8 C for JC).\\nFor detection of the viral large T-antigen, a 128 bp long fragment was amplified using modified primers from that match BKV genotypes 1 to 4, forward primer 5'-CAGGCAAGGGTTCTATTACTAAAT-3', reverse primer 5'-GCAACAGCAGATTCYCAACA-3', probe 5'-6FAM-AAACTGGTGTAGATCAGARGGAAAGTCTTTAGGGTCTT-BBQ. \\nPCR conditions were identical to the one described above except TaqMan probe that was used at 4 pico molar, primer annealing was 56 C for 10 s, and fluorescence acquisition was at the end of each primer extension phase at 530 nm.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 70-year-old male was referred to our hospital in June 2020 because of a right renal mass accidentally detected on computed tomography (CT). There were no complaints of haematuria, abdominal masses, pain, or weight loss. The patient's past medical history included hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic hepatitis B. His medications included olmesartan, aspirin and entecavir. There was no family history of cancer, and the physical examination was unremarkable.\\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed a round-like mass with obvious early enhancement in the middle part of the right kidney. The mass did not protrude beyond the renal contour and was accompanied by slight shrinkage of the renal cortex ( Figures 1A-E ). For the purpose of partial nephrectomy, 8 and 4 points were evaluated according to PADUA and SPARE nephrometry scoring systems, respectively.\\nIn preoperative discussion, urologists did not believe that the small renal mass could be accurately identified or palpated during nephron-sparing surgery. Considering that the mass was located in the lateral region of the right kidney and intraoperative ultrasound (US) was highly dependent on the operator, we decided to perform microcoil implantation prior to laparoscopy to provide a direction for partial nephrectomy.\\nAfter preoperative evaluations were performed and informed consent was obtained, the patient underwent CT-guided localization of the small renal mass without any complications or obvious inconvenience. A tornado-like radio-opaque microcoil (MWCE-18S-6/2-TORNADO, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) was implanted into the renal parenchyma targeting the small renal mass ( Figure 1F ).\\nThe right kidney was scanned by CT five times, and the cumulative effective radiation dosage was 5.1 mSv. The span between CT-guided microcoil localization and the start of the operation was 15 hours. Under general anaesthesia, the patient underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in the left lateral position. Laparoscopic exploration of the retroperitoneal cavity revealed the implanted microcoil protruding from the dorsal surface of the right kidney ( Figure 2A ). The resection range was 2 cm in radius with the implanted microcoil as the centre. The mass was completely removed without excessive damage to the renal vasculature or collecting system ( Figure 2B ). The operation time was 105 minutes, and the warm ischaemia time was 25 minutes.\\nThe postoperative recovery was smooth, and no perioperative complications occurred. The postoperative serum creatinine concentration was 88.4 mumol/L, within the normal range, and no hydronephrosis was observed on US at the postoperative follow-up. The final pathological result revealed T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC, American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM stage), WHO/ISUP grade 2 ( Figure 2C ), 16 mm in greatest dimension. The tumour did not involve the perirenal capsule and was at least 2 mm away from the surgical margin. Eleven months later, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no RCC recurrence, and the patient remained asymptomatic.\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'The first case presented at birth with imperforate anus and intestinal obstruction for which a sigmoid colostomy was performed in the neonatal period. This case represented an extreme form of anorectal anomaly with severe sacral dysplasia, pelvic asymmetry, and deformed genitalia. Chromosomal analysis confirmed normal male karyotype (46 XY). Perineal examination revealed a caudally positioned hypospadiac phallus with severe penoscrotal transposition ( Fig. 1A and B ). A single wide perineal orifice proved to be the bladder neck directly communicating with the perineum without recognizable urethra in-between (vesico-perineal fistula). The urinary bladder was very small (underdeveloped) due to continuous leakage of urine through the wide and incompetent bladder neck. Distal colostogram demonstrated no communication with the urinary tract (imperforate anus without fistula) ( Fig. 1C ). A perineal swelling was located just beside the central perineal orifice which proved to be a lipoma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ( Fig. 1D and E ). This case had other associated major anomalies: renal and testicular agenesis on the right side as well as poor lower limb development on the same side ( Fig. 1D ), asymmetrical lower vertebral dysplasia, and lipomyelomeningocele. Because of the severe distortion and asymmetry of pelvic anatomy, in addition to the presence of significant sacral dysplasia and spinal anomalies, a very poor prognosis for continence (both urinary and fecal) was expected in this case. After counseling with the parents, we decided to leave the patient with colostomy, while continent urinary diversion was performed later at the age of 4 years. The ureter of the single left kidney was disconnected from the hypoplastic bladder, and then was reimplanted in a pouch formed from intestine (ileocecal pouch), while the appendix was used as a conduit for self-catheterization (Mitrofanoff principle). The parents were instructed to keep on long-term follow-up at nephrology clinic for his special renal condition (single kidney draining into pouch of intestine). This patient is now 11 years old; and he is doing well at school. He is continent to urine through regular self-catheterization, and his single left kidney shows normal sonographic appearance at follow-up. He still has a colostomy, while the lipomyelomeningocele was managed conservatively. He underwent above knee amputation for the poorly developed right lower limb, and he is walking using artificial limb (right side) and crutches. He is now counseling for possibility of some sort of corrective surgery for the external genitalia. \\n The second case was referred to our hospital at the age of 9 months with a sigmoid colostomy performed elsewhere at birth. Perineal examination revealed similar anatomical derangement ( Fig. 2 ): single perineal orifice, caudally positioned hypospadiac phallus, severe penoscrotal transposition, in addition to a perineal swelling covered with mucous membrane. Chromosomal analysis confirmed normal male karyotype (46 XY). Imaging studies demonstrated the rectum joining with the urethra 1.5 cm below the bladder neck to form a common excretory orifice just distal to their confluence. Compared with the first case, this case represented a milder form of the anomaly, not only for the absence of major associated anomalies but also for the presence of a recognizable segment of proximal urethra below the bladder neck. However, the urethral segment was too short (like the female urethra); and the bladder neck was still wide and was located at a lower level in the pelvis opposite the distal end of the pubic symphysis ( Fig. 2D ). At the age of 18 months, posterior sagittal anorectoplasty was performed to mobilize the rectum and reposition it backward within the sphincter muscle complex, in addition to excision of the perineal swelling ( Fig. 2E , F ). Histopathological examination of excised perineal swelling was compatible with hamartomatous polyp ( Fig. 3 ). Correction of the penile deformity will require staged reconstruction.',\n",

The patient experienced no pleural effusion before his 11th birthday. The patient had a history of cerebrospinal fluid leakage due to a skull fracture at 7 years of age. The patient was referred to our department immediately following pleural effusion when he was 11 years old. A hematological examination showed high values for D-dimer (22.2 mug/mL) and P-FDP (50.9 mug/mL). A radiograph showed pleural effusion in the right lung (Figure 1). Thoracentesis revealed chylothorax mixed with blood components. Magnetic resonance imaging showed additional lesions on the lymph ducts on both sides of the inner auditory channels; computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse osteolytic changes on both sides of the femoral neck and thoracic vertebra.  Figure 2 shows the patient's clinical course. Although the patient abstained from eating and parenteral nutrition was provided in addition to octreotide testing and pulse steroid therapy, pleural effusion worsened and became bilateral. Two or more liters were drained on days when there was a large amount of pleural effusion. We were unable to locate the site of the leakage even though we conducted a lymphogram to treat the pleural effusion and identify the leakage site. Sirolimus administration was initiated at 0.88 mg/m2/day, which proved to be an insufficient dosage. However, when the dosage was increased to 1.3 mg/m2/day after 1 month, the patient experienced an onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after 1 week. At that time, a blood examination showed platelet (1.4 x 104/muL), P-FDP (590 mug/mL), fibrinogen (114 mg/dL), prothrombin time rate (1.35), antithrombin (129%), and no liver dysfunction. The urine and blood cultures were negative. Viral serology was negative for cytomegalovirus, and aspergillus antigen was negative. Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were normal levels. The CT scan showed no sign of pneumonia or pyothorax. We diagnosed him with DIC using DIC score. Although we temporarily paused the administration of sirolimus, the patient experienced an additional onset of DIC 10 days after we resumed administration. Thus, he underwent thoracoscopic removal of the hematoma (Figure 3). The trough level of sirolimus during administration was 3.4-8.9 ng/mL, which does not represent abnormal elevation. Although an additional pause in the administration of sirolimus did not reduce the amount of pleural fluid, there were no additional onsets of DIC. Subsequently, there was a significant decrease in pleural fluid once Eppikajyutsuto was administered at 0.2 g/kg/day. We were able to proceed with tube thoracostomy removal 40 days after the initiation of oral administration. There was no re-accumulation of pleural fluids in the 18 months following the initiation of oral administration.\",\n",

At presentation, the best corrected visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/15 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 30 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left eye. Biomicroscopy revealed ciliary injection, corneal epithelial edema, mutton-fat keratic precipitates, flare, and infiltrating cells in the anterior chamber of the right eye (Figure 1A and B). In addition, pigmentation of trabecular pigment band in the angle was increased in the right eye compared with the left eye (Figure 1C and D). Although mild opacity and cell infiltration in the anterior vitreous of the right eye were present, retinitis or retinal vasculitis was not observed. No abnormalities were found in the left eye.\\nIn addition to the laboratory blood tests, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for human herpes viruses (HHVs) 1 through 8, of the aqueous humor from the right eye was performed, and treatment with topical 0.1% betamethasone, mydriatic (0.1% phenylephrine and 0.1% tropicamide), and 0.005% latanoprost for ocular hypertension was initiated.

Her postoperative period was uneventful and she was discharged home the next day. On the 11th postoperative day she was readmitted to the emergency unit at 11 pm with considerable abdominal distension, shortness of breath and difficulty of micturition with straining to void. Further questioning revealed sudden inability to void 5 days earlier followed by mild hematuria and passing a small amount of urine. On examination she was dyspneic, the abdomen was distended, pulse rate was 100 BPM, blood pressure was 100/60 mm/Hg and afebrile.

Natural substrate potato dextrose agar (PDA) agar medium was prepared using 20 g of dry powder of PDA medium (Beijing Tiantan Bio) dissolved in 1,000 ml of supernatant of distilled water soaked in dry leaves. Meanwhile, ordinary PDA agar medium was prepared using distilled water.\\nFungal DNA extraction kit (EE101, TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) was used to extract DNA of the isolates. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS), beta-tubulin (BT2), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef-1), and RNA polymerase II (RPB2) gene were amplified using PCR as follows. PCR reaction system: Taq of 0.5 mul, 2x Taq Master Mix of 25 mul, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) of 5 mul, upstream and downstream primers of 0.5 mul each, template DNA of 2 mul, and ddH2O of up to 50 mul. Reaction conditions: pre-denaturation at 94 C for 2 min; denaturation at 94 C for 30 s, annealing at 58 C for 30 s, extension at 72 C for 90s, cycle number 35; extension at 72 C for 7 min. The primer sequences (5'-3') were ITS1: TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG and ITS4: TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC for ITS; T1: AACATGCGTGAGATTGTAAGT and Bt2b: ACCCTCA-GTGTAGTGACCCTTGGC for BT2; EF1-1018F: GAYTTCATCAAGAACATGAT and EF1-1620R: GACGTTGAADCCRACRTTGTC for tef-1; DRPB2-5F: GAYACNGAYGAYCGWGAYCAYTTYGG and DRPB2-7R: AANCCCATDGCYTGYTTDCCCAT for RPB2. The PCR products were identified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced by Tsingke Biotechnology Co (Chengdu, China).\\nThe sequences were submitted to GenBank, and accession numbers were obtained (OQ658167 for ITS, OQ700917 for BT2, OQ700916 for tef-1, and OQ700915 for RPB2). Phylogenetic trees of ITS, tef-1, and RPB2 were constructed by neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 6.06 software.\\nAntifungal susceptibility tests were performed by using the Sensititre YeastOne  YO10 (CN15009V2, Thermo Scientific, Cleveland, OH, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the conidia were collected with a cotton swab, suspended in a sterile saline solution containing Tween-20, and inoculated on the drug-sensitive plate. The broth microdilution panel was incubated in a non-CO2 incubator at 35 C for 72 h. Candida albicans ATCC14053 was used as the quality control strain in this test. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were read according to the MIC interpretation standard of Aspergillus following the kit instructions (recommended by CLSI M38 and EUCAST).\",\n",

Upper GI studies were normal. Thyroid function tests, complete metabolic profile, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and array CGH were normal. Bone age was normal; skull X-ray showed only the large anterior fontanelle, but absence of Wormian bones. Genetic testing for Russell-Silver syndrome, mandibulo acral dysplasia were negative. Sweat chloride test was normal, and a chest CT scan was normal. Lung biopsy showed focal smooth muscle thickening of pre-acinar arterioles. At 4-years old, the patient's fasting serum leptin was 0.7 ng/mL, which is much lower than healthy 4-year old females: 1.9 (1.5-2.7).\\nAverage genome sequencing depth was 39x, with 96.93% over 10x depth. Variant calling revealed a de novo frame-shift mutation in the CAV1 gene (chr7:116199282-3>delTT; NM_001172897.1:c.385_386delTT;NP_001166368.1:p.Phe129X; NM_001753.4:c.478_479delTT;NP_001744.2:p.Phe160X), previously associated with Congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3. The mutation introduces an immediate stop into the protein. Whole genome sequencing could not reveal a second mutation in CAV1, although coverage across all exons was sufficient to detect variations. In addition, we also found a second variant of interest in a gene associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1: AGPAT2 (chr9:139581758insCAG; NM_006412.3:c.51_52insGTC; NP_006403.2:p.X18Leu; rs201504151). The variant in AGPAT2 is inherited from the father, though quite frequently present in the normal population (7.18%, exome variant server). It is unclear whether this variant contributes to any symptoms present the patient. A last interesting variant was found in lipin 1 (LPIN1), in which mutations cause a lipoatrophic phenotype in the mouse (chr2: 11927238G>A;NP_001248356.1:p.Val500Met; rs33997857). This variant has a 2.2% frequency in the population, was inherited from the mother, and is predicted damaging. The CADD scores and details of all 3 variants are listed in Table 1. All variants were confirmed with Sanger sequencing in the patient and parents. Studying mRNA extracted from the patient's whole blood revealed that both mutant and wild type CAV1 were transcribed (Fig B in S1 File), and that the RNA from the mutant allele was neither degraded by nonsense mediated RNA decay; nor was the second allele silenced by a regulatory mutation.\\nOverrepresentation analysis was done to identify pathways that are dysregulated in our patient compared to 4 healthy controls, unaffected relatives from patients of our rare childhood disorder center. 1346 genes reached significance after multiple testing (FDR correction) (2.5% of total genes), 519 were recognized in a REACTOME pathway for analysis (Table A in S1 File). Most genes were found to be downregulated. Most significantly dysregulated pathways are: Translational regulation, RNA metabolism and protein metabolism and most interesting pathways are shown in Fig 1.\\nIn addition, we looked at genes involved in other progeroid and lipodystrophy syndromes (Fig 2). We found that several progeroid syndrome genes are dysregulated: LMNA, ATM, RECQL4 and WRN. The gene causing Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy (AGPAT2) is very significantly underexpressed (padj = 0.002; Fig 2). BSCL2, PTRF and LPIN1 lipodystrophy genes are not differentially expressed.\\n129 proteins are found to interact directly with Cav1 based previous studies (NCBI gene interactions; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene), and 102 of these were expressed highly enough in RNA extracted from whole blood to perform differential analysis. Of these 102, 30 were significantly different between our case and the controls (29.4%) (Table B in S1 File), and 72 (73.3%) are down regulated (Fig 2).\\nCaveolins interact with a variety of downstream signaling molecules, including Src-family tyrosine kinases, p42/44 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In the Caveolin downstream pathway, we found a significant under expression of NOSIP, a modulator of eNOS. MAPK3 (p44) is underexpressed, and HCK and FGR are also significantly underexpressed (SRC-family tyrosine kinases) (Fig 2). Caveolin-1 associates with TRAF2 to form a complex that is recruited to tumor necrosis factor receptors. In this pathway, TRADD, TRAF2, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B are also significantly underexpressed (Fig 2).\\nProtein lysates from case and control fibroblasts were subjected to western blotting to measure protein expression of CAV1 (in triplicate). Two different antibodies were used: one that targets the C-terminus of CAV1 (and would only recognize the wild type (WT) CAV1), and one that recognized an internal epitope of CAV1 (which would recognize both WT and mutant (MT) CAV1 if expressed). All blots showed a significant decrease in expression of CAV1 compared to the control that was similar between an antibody that detected WT CAV1 only and an antibody detecting both WT + MT CAV1, suggesting MT CAV1 is not expressed or expressed at a very low level (Fig 3). In addition, fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips, fixed and stained for localization of CAV1 and PTRF (Caveolae marker) (Fig 3). In the control, co-localization of CAV1 and the caveolae marker was perfect, however, the co-localization was not entirely fully concordant in the case (Fig 3).\",\n",

She had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at another hospital 3 years before bleeding because of a headache, and an incidental tumor (volume 4.31 cm3) along the right falx cerebri had been identified. MRI showed the tumor as a well-circumscribed, slightly high-intensity area on T2-weighted images and a dural tail sign. The tumor was suspected to be a falx meningioma. The follow-up MRI 1 year before bleeding showed that the tumor had rapidly grown to 12.76 cm3. The follow-up MRI 2 weeks before bleeding showed 22.27 cm3 of volume and grown not only to the right but also to the left falx cerebri. Furthermore, MRI revealed a left flow void showing blood vessels that had moved from the median side to the lateral side due to tumor growth [Figure 1]. She was scheduled for tumor removal as MRI showed a rapidly growing tumor. However, she experienced a sudden onset of disturbance of consciousness and was transferred to our hospital before scheduled treatment. On arrival, her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6 (E1V1M4) and the right hemiplegia was observed. She had no history of traumatic events or physical scarring. After admission, the patient presented with generalized convulsions and was administered anti-seizure medication. Computed tomography (CT) revealed left hemispheric ASDH, interhemispheric ASDH, and intracerebral hematoma extending from the left intra-/ extra-tumoral lesion. Contrast CT showed extravasation in the hematoma of the left frontal lobe. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed 1 day after admission showed neither tumor staining nor abnormal vessels. In the venous phase of the bilateral common carotid angiogram, the anterior part of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) revealed no obliteration [Figure 2].\\nTumor removal and hematoma evacuation were performed 3 days after admission. First, we removed the left frontal hematoma due to an increase in dural pressure and subsequently confirmed a decrease in dural pressure. Second, we performed internal decompression of the tumor and incised the SSS and falx to block feeding arteries. Third, we dissected the tumor from the surrounding normal brain parenchyma, removed the gross total of the tumor together with the falx of the attachment (Simpson Grade I), and drained the hematoma. No clear active bleeding points or intratumoral subacute clot was found intraoperatively. Fragile and irregular vessels were attached to the tumor wall.\\nThe pathological diagnosis was confirmed as meningothelial meningioma (the World Health Organization [WHO] Grade I according to the 2016 Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System). Postoperative CT confirmed the removal of the tumor and hematoma. Postoperative enhanced MRI revealed gross total tumor removal [Figure 3].

At the age of 25, progesterone replacement therapy (PRT) was prescribed with a significant decrease in pain and cramps around menstruations, but worsening episodes of migraine with aura concomitantly occurred. She reported no neurologic symptoms. On neurological examination, strength, skin sensation, visual field, reflexes, and coordination were normal.\\nShe was suffering since childhood from prodromal symptoms (sensitivity to light) preceding recurrent attacks of unilateral reversible visual aura and sensory symptoms (numbness) that were usually followed by intensive headache lasting up to 24 h occurring two times a week with nausea often followed by emesis with aggravation of the headaches, meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders-3rd edition for migraine aura. Tryptans did not ameliorate her headaches. T1-, T2-, T2-FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed scanty focal bilateral supratentorial white matter hyperintensities (WMHs).\\nPregnancy was planned and HRT was suspended. After an uneventful delivery, HRT was re-started and a severe migraine aura occurred thereafter.\\nOn control MRI 1 year later, WMHs of the same size and number were identified (Figure 1) as it has been reported in shunt-associated migraine (SAM) patients.\\nElectrocardiogram showed persistent sinus rhythm and incomplete right bundle branch block. Chest X-ray, computed tomography angiography (CTA), and 2D TTE/TEE color Doppler were performed resulting within normal limits. Contrast TTE/TEE using agitated saline solution showed no RLS across the interatrial septum (Figure 2, Supplementary Videos 1, 2) but conversely demonstrated bubbles arriving from left pulmonary veins to the left atrium and left ventricle via a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (Supplementary Figure 1) in basal conditions. Contrast-enhanced Transcranial Doppler (cTCD) raised the suspicion of an extracardiac RLS by showing in basal conditions high-intensity transient signals passing through the middle cerebral artery with a delayed (17 s) \"shower\" pattern (Figure 3, Supplementary Video 2). Of note, aura migraine symptoms occurred 4 min after agitated saline injection (\"bubble migraine positive\" patient). According to the protocol of the Venice 1999 Consensus conference, the bubble count was performed twice, during normal breathing and after Valsalva strain. It is worth to mention that no evidence or family history of HHT was documented in her past medical history.\\nThe decision was made by our multidisciplinary heart and brain team to offer a clinical re-evaluation in order to stratify the risk of paradoxical embolism and consequently to perform possibly a catheter-based embolization using detachable coils or vascular plugs of the isolated intrapulmonary RLS. Written informed consent, after explanation, was obtained from the patient. During the hospital stay, she was monitored for vital parameters without any abnormalities except for a slight reduction in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%. Continuous ECG ruled out atrial fibrillation. Right heart catheterization to evaluate hemodynamic parameters and selective pulmonary angiograms were performed in order to definitively check for an isolated PAVM and to search for accompanying malformations. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (QP/QS) were within normal limits. It has been impossible to cross the interatrial septum with a multipurpose catheter despite multiple attempts. Oddly, selective right and left pulmonary arteriograms did not show abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature or arteriovenous shunts (Figure 4, Supplementary Video 3). Brachiocephalic vein angiogram ruled out the presence of persistent left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, another possible rare cause of RLS and paradoxical embolism (Supplementary Video 4).\\nThe Heart and Brain team then decided to discharge the patient on off-label thienopyridine agents (clopidogrel 75 mg die) in terms of primary prophylaxis for paradoxical embolization of thrombotic material that could bypass the pulmonary capillary filter. Surprisingly, a substantial reduction in aura migraine symptoms in our patient was achieved using P2Y12 platelet inhibition, suggesting a platelet-based trigger. HRT was advantageously resumed without migraine attacks. During 2 years of follow-up on thienopyridine therapy, the resolution of migraine aura episodes was accomplished.',\n",

He denied any fevers, or sputum production. His heart rate was 78 bpm with a blood pressure of 141/68, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Physical exam was significant for respiratory distress, jugular venous distension, bibasilar rales, decreased breath sounds at the right lung base, and warm lower extremities without edema. INR was therapeutic at 3.2 and routine chemistries and CBC were unremarkable. Chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular congestion, and cardiomegaly. The patient was admitted and treated with intravenous diuretics for acute decompensated heart failure.\\nOn hospital day 8, the patient remained dyspneic despite negative fluid balance. The procedure team was consulted and bedside ultrasound revealed a persistent, large right-sided pleural effusion with an apparent large loculation of fluid 6 cm from the posterior chest wall (Fig. 1, A). A diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was planned. Prior to the procedure, a CT scan of the chest from two years prior was reviewed (Fig. 1, B and C). The apparent loculation of fluid seen on bedside ultrasound was determined to be a \"giant left atrium\" (15 cm x 7.2 cm), which is likely the sequela of rheumatic heart disease.\\nGiven the patient\\'s high risk of stroke from mechanical aortic and mitral valves with atrial fibrillation, his therapeutic anticoagulation was not reversed prior to thoracentesis, but coumadin had been held. A therapeutic thoracentesis was successfully performed via a posterior-lateral approach and 800 ml of clear yellow fluid was removed with improvement in patient\\'s dyspnea. His hemodynamics and post-procedure hematocrit remained stable. His INR was 3 the morning before therapeutic thoracentesis and 1.8 the next day, which required bridging with low molecular weight heparin. Post-procedure chest X-ray showed a reduction in the right-sided pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Fluid characteristics were consistent with a transudative pleural effusion and cytology was negative for malignant cells.\\nThe availability of ultrasound at the bedside has enabled clinicians to make rapid assessments and treatment decisions at the point-of-care. Ultrasound assistance in thoracentesis has even been shown to reduce pneumothorax rates. However, this case illustrates the importance of reviewing relevant prior diagnostic imaging before a bedside procedure, even when point-of-care ultrasound is used; attempting to drain the apparent fluid loculation (the giant left atrium) could have had devastating consequences. Furthermore, this case supports the growing evidence that performing a bedside thoracentesis is safe at an INR >1.5.',\n",

Her mother experienced similar symptoms at that time, and so a self-limited infectious etiology was presumed. The patient at that time had a personal history of bacterial upper respiratory infections and scarlet fever. Her family history is significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia (father) and myocardial infarction at age 52 (paternal grandfather). The patient's abdominal pain led to an extensive GI work-up in 1989 revealing normal upper and lower endoscopic biopsies, a normal hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, normal fecal cultures for bacteria, ova, and parasites, a negative study for lactase deficiency, and unrevealing serology for auto-immune disease. An HIV test and screen for cystic fibrosis were negative. Laboratory screening for thyroid function, copper, ceruloplasmin, gastrin, and porphyrin levels was also unrevealing. The patient did have significant dyslipidemia in 1989 as follows: total cholesterol 406, LDL 356, HDL 16, VLDL 41, and triglyceride 206. Additional lab work indicated ApoA1 was 63 mg/dL (normal > 140) and ApoB was 162 mg/dL (normal < 130). Liver function tests in 1989 were also abnormal as follows: AST 74, ALT 134, ALP 196. The patient continued to suffer from frequent GI upset and increased bowel motions with pediatric growth charts indicating a failure to thrive. A decision was made to start the patient on cholestyramine with a low-fat diet which showed some improvement in her lipid profile as indicated in Figure 1A. When hepatomegaly was appreciated in 1990, a liver biopsy led to a suspected diagnosis of a glycogen storage disease, and she was started on cornstarch. Cholestyramine was discontinued, but then re-started shortly after it was discovered she still had marked dyslipidemia. A second liver wedge biopsy performed in 1990 showed a non-specific storage disease of a lipid nature and, ultimately, deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) confirmed the disorder to be CESD.\\nThe patient was managed initially by a pediatric gastroenterologist until it was believed that her GI symptoms were unrelated to her dyslipidemia, and then a pediatric cardiologist assumed care for the patient.

Two days later, he was readmitted as a result of cyanosis.\\nOn examination, the patient was found to have dysmorphic features and hypocalcemia, in addition to the congenital cardiac anomalies described earlier. Further tests were performed, and he was found to have DiGeorge syndrome, as well as cholestasis and jaundice. The patient was started on ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), oral feeding with Similac 20 (Abbott, Ill), and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure control and support.\\nAt the age of 27 days, the patient was found to have developed a small localized swelling on the dorsum of the right hand. It was initially thought to be an injury caused by intravenous cannulation. The mass persisted for 2 weeks and then the infant became febrile and the right hand dorsal swelling became erythematous and hot to touch. Cellulitis was suspected; thus, empiric treatment with morphine, meropenem, vancomycin, and colistin was commenced by the primary team while the septic workup was being undertaken.\\nThree days later, the plastic surgery service was consulted on the slowly growing swelling on the back of the hand. The plastic surgeon's examination revealed a small area of fluctuation over the mass. An ultrasound scan was ordered, and aspiration of the swelling was done and the fluid was sent for gram staining, culture, and sensitivity testing. Silver sulfadiazine cream and dressings were ordered to be applied to the wound twice daily until such time as the results of investigations were apparent. Ultrasound assessment of the hand revealed soft-tissue swelling and calcification.\\nOn the next day, an x-ray film was obtain and the image exhibited a central area of calcification within the swelling as well. Moreover, results of blood and fluid cultures were inconclusive and found no organisms; antibiotic treatment was discontinued. However, silver sulfadiazine cream application was continued but reduced to once daily, and the hand was kept elevated. The swelling on the dorsum of the hand reduced gradually over the following few days, and dressing protocol was continued. A week later, however, at the age of 51 days, the swelling increased in size once more. Aspiration was conducted a second time, and the fluid sent for staining and culture, which proved to be negative again. Blood investigations did not yield any insight into the cause of the patient's condition either. It was at this juncture when the diagnosis of HO was considered. No further treatment was ordered except for frequent monitoring to rule out superimposed infection and cellulitis.\",\n",

He had been diagnosed with infantile nephrotic syndrome 5 months earlier. In his past medical history, he had several episodes of septicemia caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, he was previously on multiple courses of antibiotics including meropenem, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. He was intubated and ventilated. Blood specimens revealed mild neutrophilia and elevated CRP. Blood culture and urine culture were negative. Chest X rays revealed left sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe opacities. Several respiratory specimens from endotracheal tube (ETT) were submitted to the microbiology laboratory for culture. Round yellow pigmented non hemolytic colonies grew on blood agar plates. Gram stain revealed Gram negative bacilli. The organism was catalase and oxidase positive. Organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were carried out using the Vitek 2 automatic system (bioMerieux, Paris, France) according the manufacturer's instructions. E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strains were used as controls for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing. There are no Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines specific for Chryseobacterium species. However, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and breakpoints were determined according to the CLSI recommendation for other Non-Enterobacteriaceae. The organism was identified as Chryseobacterium gleum and it was confirmed using API20NE kit and 16 S rRNA sequencing. The organism was resistant to ceftazidime (MIC >= 64 mug/mL), cefepime (MIC >= 64 mug/mL), meropenem (MIC >= 16 mug/mL), piperacillin-tazobactam (MIC >= 128 mug/mL), colistin (MIC >= 8 mug/mL), gentamicin (MIC >= 16 mug/mL), and amikacin (MIC >= 64 mug/mL). It was intermediate to imipenem (MIC = 8 mug/mL), ciprofloxacin (MIC = 2 mug/mL), and tigecycline (MIC = 4 mug/mL). The organism was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC <= 20 mug/mL), minocycline (MIC <= 1 mug/mL), and levofloxacin (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL). In addition, the isolate was resistant to vancomycin. Environmental samples from the mechanical ventilator and the patient room did not grow any Chryseobacterium isolate. Chryseobacterium was tested for the presence of carbapenem resistant genes (OXA48, NDM1, IMP, VIM, CTX-14, CTX-M15, and KPC) by multiplex PCR methodology using ARM-D for beta-Lactamase ID kit (Streck, Omaha, NE, USA) as instructed by the manufacturer. Positive controls and an internal control are included in the kit. In addition, molecular grade water (Promega, WI, USA) was used as a negative control to detect contamination. None of the tested genes was detected by PCR. The patient improved on levofloxacin for a period of 16 days and subsequent respiratory specimens did not grow C. gleum. Neither trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole nor minocycline was used since they were not available in hospital at time of treatment.\",\n",

At 31 years of age, the patient experienced a slight weakness in the left leg that included numbness, which resulted in gait problems that did not interfere with a normal lifestyle. Over the next four years, symptoms progressively worsened and led to weakness in the left leg. Simultaneously, the right leg became weak and numb, and urinary retention and urgent micturition ensued, which persisted to time of the study. Over the last two years, the left hand became uncoordinated and mild dysarthria developed. Since then, the patient experienced mood disorders, as well as involuntary and frequent crying spells. The patient exhibited slight cognitive impairment over a ten-year period, which interfered with employment status, social interactions, and daily life. The patient did not suffer from migraine headaches during this period.\\nPast medical history revealed right central retinal artery occlusion and retinal hemorrhage at age 33, which was surgically treated. However, right-eye vision was also lost at time of study. There was no family history of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolaemia. Seven members in his family experienced similar syndromes (Table 1, Figure 1).\\nNeurological examination revealed normal vital signs, slight dysarthria, loss of vision, and direct and indirect light reflexes in the abducted right eye, with a 5-mm dilated pupil. Fundoscopic examination revealed optical nerve atrophy. Left-eye visual acuity and fields remained intact. Muscle mass was within normal limits. Strength was 4+/5 in the left leg, 5-/5 in the left arm and right leg, and intact in the right arm. Deep tendon reflex was significantly increased, in particular on the left side. Extensor plantar responses were elicited on both sides. Gait was hemiparetic, with poor bilateral coordination. Patellar and ankle clonus was bilaterally present. Brown hemochromatosis and hypesthesia were noted on calf areas of both legs (supplementary Figure 2 online). Remaining physical examinations were unremarkable.\\nComplete blood count, tests of hepatic and renal function, and measurements of lipoprotein A, electrolytes, glucose, thyroxine, vitamin B12, antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were all within normal limits. Serological examination for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and tumor markers were negative. No abnormalities were found on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.\\nPrevious brain computed tomography (CT) and MRI results revealed multiple infarctions, as well as multiple abnormal signals and bilateral pontine atrophy in the head MRI. Hyperintense signals were noted in the corpus pons, genu of the callosum, left basal ganglia, corona radiate, and semiovale centrum on T2-weighted images, as well as symmetrical high signals in the bilateral temporal lobes (Figures 2A, B, D). A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence revealed diffuse hyperintense signals in the subcortical and deep white matter (Figure 2C). Diffusion sequences produced negative results.\\nA sural nerve biopsy was performed and the glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue was examined by transmission electron microscopy, revealing granular osmophilic material (GOM) deposits in the extracellular matrix adjacent to and within smooth muscle cells of dermal arterioles. The deposits were variable in size; the largest measured approximately 0.4-0.6 mm (Figure 3). Screening exons 2-4 for mutations of NOTCH 3 by direct sequencing produced negative results.',\n",

Initial biochemical evaluation was concerning for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), requiring magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine staging and appropriate treatment. However, due to limitations of the MRI machine at the pediatric center, the patient was unable to obtain imaging secondary to body habitus presenting a significant diagnostic challenge. The obesity medicine team was consulted for assistance with acute weight loss to promote ability for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and initiation of an appropriate treatment regimen for his oncologic process. The patient was admitted to inpatient rehabilitation for two weeks. On admission, his type 2 diabetes was controlled with insulin and metformin and he had a hgA1c of 6.4. However, due to worsening hepatotoxicity, his Metformin was discontinued. Given his new onset AL.L and concern for chemotherapy induced pancreatitis, the oncology team did not feel comfortable starting a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) medication. Interventions included placing the patient on the institutional inpatient obesity protocol including: (1) intake with a registered dietitian; (2) dietary composition: 1,500 calorie per day, less than 150 grams of carbohydrates, no sugar-sweetened beverages, 35 grams of fiber, 32 ounces of water; (3) structured mealtimes (3 meals and 2 snacks); (4) daily physical therapy as tolerated; (5) initiation of weight loss medications (phentermine 15 mg daily). One week after initiation of this protocol, his weight was down trending and he was tolerating phentermine without side effect. Given lack of side effects but increasing hunger with goal of continued weight loss in efforts to obtain an MRI, his phentermine was increased to 37.5 mg daily and dietary program intensified to 1,200 calories and less than 100 grams of carbohydrates daily. At admission, his weight was at 190% BMIp95 (Figure 3). Upon discharge and after two weeks after initiation of his individualized weight-management plan, it decreased to 175%BMIp95 and his hgba1c improved to 6.0. He also reported decreased appetite and no side effects throughout his treatment. He continued his outpatient weight-management program with monthly virtual visits with obesity medicine specialists and dietitian. One month after discharge, his %BMI95 had decreased to 165% BMIp95, and by month six, to 160% BMIp95 (associated with a total BMI reduction of 4.85 kg/m2 and BMI z-score reduction of 0.12 standard deviations).',\n",

Outpatient, he was taking Metformin 1,000 mg twice daily and Topiramate 100 mg nightly for off-label weight control. Family had completed three, intensive outpatient lifestyle modifications programs and set up a food safe zone (locked cabinets and food storage units) with limited success. Upon admission, he had a 40-pound gain since his last outpatient encounter four months prior and his respiratory function had worsened significantly in response to this weight gain with blood gases demonstrating carbon dioxide retention levels in the upper 70s. He underwent extensive evaluation for hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, and worsening obstructive sleep apnea and his acutely worsened respiratory status was thought to be largely secondarily to his weight gain. This evaluation included a normal electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and renal ultrasound. He underwent a polysomnography which was abnormal due to breath stacking, hyperventilation, and hypoxemia for which his CPAP machine was adjusted. He also had a number of screening labs during his hospitalization with normal thyroid function (TSH 2.62 uIU/ml, T4 7.5 mcg/dl), free cortisol (0.18), ACTH (21) hgbA1c (5.3%), lipid panel (triglycerides 94, total cholesterol 150).

He was initially received pulse therapy with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone in a cumulative dose of 1000 mg); then, he administrated methylprednisolone at a dose of 4 mg/day per os. On 20 April, the patient noted weakness, fever up to 38 C, nasal congestion, anosmia, dry cough, and chest congestion. The repeated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for 2019-nCoV was positive. The patient was hospitalized at the clinic for patients with COVID-19, where he was staying from 21 April to 3 May 2020, with a diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (mild case), nasopharyngitis. During hospitalization, computed tomography (CT) scanning of the chest was performed, according to which no pathological changes were detected. In the course of hospitalization, there was a moderate increase of C-reactive protein (up to 12.5 mg/L, reference values:up to 8.0 mg/L). During hospitalization for COVID-2019, the patient received hydroxychloroquine and clarithromycin.\\nIt is also known from the anamnesis that the patient has no established cardiovascular diseases. Among cardiovascular risk factors were active smoking for 26 years (20 cigarettes/day), overweight (height = 171 cm, weight = 85 kg, body mass index (BMI) = 29.1 kg/m2). The patient denied the use of psychoactive substances (cocaine, etc.).\\nOn admission to the emergency department on 8 May, according to objective examination, the parameters were as follows: blood pressure = 126/78 mm Hg, heart rate = 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate = 18 per minute, additional respiratory sounds in the lungs were not auscultated, saturation (on room air) = 99%. On admission, a high-sensitive cardiac troponin was within the reference values. The patient was given loading doses of acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, and heparin. The electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission is shown in Figure 1.\\nTaking into account the clinical picture of ACS with ST segment elevation, the patient underwent coronary angiography. A linear dissection of ramus intermedius (RI) was established over 20 mm with stenosis of the lumen up to 80% in diameter against the background of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 blood flow in all coronary arteries (Figure 2).\\nIt was decided to stent RI dissection area with a drug-coated sirolimus stent. TIMI 3 blood flow on control angiograms is shown in Figure 3. The results of laboratory tests are presented in Table 1.\\nSubsequently, the patient received therapy consistent with the clinical recommendations, including triple antithrombotic therapy using acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, and infusion of unfractionated heparin intravenously.\\nAt 7:20 p.m. of the same day, in the intensive care unit, the patient again had anginal pain syndrome without significant effect from nitroglycerin; the pain was relieved with morphine. ECG was performed (see Figure 4).\\nGiven the appearance of ST segment elevation in the leads from the inferior wall of the left ventricle, the patient underwent repeated angiography (see Figure 5).\\nIt was established that the stented segment and other sections of the left coronary artery (LCA) had no stenosis. Blood flow along the right coronary artery (RCA) TIMI 0-1 with occlusion in the distal section. Also, stenosis of the initial and middle sections of the RCA was detected (up to 60%-75%) over the entire length according to the type of possible spasm in comparison with the initial coronary angiograms. After two injections of contrast into the RCA and 2.0 mL of a 0.01% solution of nitroglycerin, recanalization was observed with the restoration of the initial caliber of the artery with visualization of linear dissections throughout the initial and middle sections. According to the control angiography, after 15 min (see Figure 6), a decrease in the length of the dissected segment in the initial and middle sections of the RCA and posterior lateral branch of the RCA was established. Taking into account the TIMI 3 blood flow, extended lesions of the RCA, and the posterolateral branch of the RCA, spontaneous positive dynamics in relation to this dissected segment, conservative management were applied.\\nOver the next 72 h, the patient's condition remained stable, and chest pain did not recur. In the morning of 14 May, the patient again felt a pain behind the sternum, lasting up to 10-15 min and stopping on its own. ECG was performed, and found that there were no significant dynamic changes from previous ECGs (see Figure 7).\\nIt was decided to conduct control angiography. It was detected that there was no change either in the RCA or the posterolateral branch of the RCA in comparison with the previous examination. The stented segment of the RI LCA was passable; however, in one of the RI branches, immediately after its bifurcation, stenosis of up to 85% in diameter with a length of 20-25 mm was detected, which was absent in the previous two angiograms (see Figure 8). With intracoronary administration of 2 mL of 0.01% nitroglycerin, there were no changes in the degree of stenosis in the affected artery.\\nSubsequently, anginal pain did not recur. The patient was discharged from the clinic on 20 May 2020. Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for publication of the case report and accompanying images.\\nIt should be noted that, during the hospitalization, the patient was consulted by a rheumatologist. Additional examinations were performed (antinuclear antibodies, HLA-B27 test, rheumatoid factor, antibodies to beta2-macroglobulin:all tests were negative), which allowed the rheumatologist to exclude the presence of chronic systemic inflammatory disease. CT of the chest in dynamics from April 2020 was also performed, which also showed no pathological changes (see Figure 9).\",\n",

       "    'case_text': 'Typical data mining models train on data collected in the past, and then are used to make decisions about the future. If there are historical inequalities inherent in the training data, they will be perpetuated, and possibly even exacerbated by our predictive model. Skewed training data can lead to better accuracy for some groups vs. others. We discussed the example of gender stereotypes encoded in word embeddings used in natural language processing (Bolukbasi et al.,), and the example of facial recognition tools trained on majority white, male faces (Buolamwini and Gebru,). These examples demonstrate cases where fairness research had a real world impact, as these papers have prompted companies to improve facial recognition software, and the development of bias mitigation techniques for text analysis. We discussed questions to consider when developing/applying new method, e.g., \"Who will use this technology, and will it work equally well for everyone?\" and \"Is my dataset representative of all groups?\"\\nThe learning objectives of the tutorial are to examine some examples of structural inequality in society that is buttressed by data mining practices including developing ways to recognize ways in which unfair bias might be introduced into a data mining pipeline. Because vulnerable populations are often placed in the position of being whistleblowers for structural inequalities, we discussed how to perform analyses to verify whether a predictive model is fair or unfair and what outcomes should be considered when developing data mining techniques beyond accuracy. To address these concerns we have to develop tools to democratize the development of data mining techniques and technologies using open and transparent methods with clearly reproducible findings. This tutorial demonstrates one approach to doing this [i.e., with interactive Jupyter notebooks (Kluyver et al.,)] and give students hands-on experience with open software tools.\\nThe Algorithmic Fairness for Vulnerable Populations tutorial steps through a typical data analysis pipeline. First the data is cleaned and preprocessed according to the steps taken in the ProPublica analysis. Then a number of statistical and visualization methods are applied to allow participants to assess the attributes in the training dataset and understand whether there is any unfair bias present. Finally, three notions of group fairness are introduced, covering state-of the-art bias detection metrics from the recent literature:\\nDisparate Impact. This legal concept is used to describe situations when an entity such as an employer inadvertently discriminates against a certain protected group. This is distinct from disparate treatment where discrimination is intentional. To demonstrate cases of disparate impact, the Equal Opportunity Commission (EEOC) proposed \"rule of thumb\" is known as the 80% rule.\\nCalibration. This statistical test was used to verify the fairness of the COMPAS model by the company Northpoint that created the tool. The basic idea behind calibrating a classifier is to have the confidence of the predictor reflect the true outcomes. In a well-calibrated classifier, if 100 people are assigned 90% confidence of being in the positive class, then in reality, 90 of them should actually have had a positive label. To use calibration as a fairness metric we compare the calibration of the classifier for each group.\\nEqualized Odds. The last fairness metric we consider is based on the difference in error rates between groups. The equalized odds criterion (Hardt et al.,) proposes to look at the difference in the true positive and false positive rates for each group. This aligns with the analysis performed by ProPublica.\\nThe goal of this tutorial\\'s implementation was to allow for hands-on analysis right away, without requiring any heavy overhead from installing many tools or having to clean and pre-process the data. At the same time, all analysis was fully transparent and available for experimentation. Participants could step through the notebook and simply follow along, or dig deeper and edit the code directly to experiment with the data. Suggestions for possible further experimentation are provided throughout. Links to datasets, research papers, Wikipedia entries, and Python data mining tools provide context and avenues for deeper investigation into the topics and methods described. A clear outcomes was that trainees who undertook the data manipulation and assessment felt empowered to identify the limitations of data resulting from structural inequalities and to identify mechanisms to address those biases in data.\\nIndigenous communities represent a classic example of a vulnerable population for whom territorial rights, educational attainment and health status are all under stress. Nevertheless, they remain a subject of keen genomic interest to western scientists. Unfortunately, these largely one-sided cross cultural scientific interactions between Indigenous populations and European ancestried scientists have long been steeped in misunderstanding and mistrust. Cases like the Havasupai Nation\\'s inclusion in stigmatizing mental health research against their will have helped to drive many Indigenous peoples to reassess their willingness to work with non-Indigenous scientists (Garrison,). The development of novel large scale data generation tools have emphasized the voluntary exclusion of Indigenous populations and the paucity of data upon which to gain meaningful insights on Indigenous communities\\' health and well-being.\\nThe utility of data analysis has been readily adopted by human geneticists, who have willingly accepted the tools of big data to better understand the features of the genome including variable sites across the genome, chromosomal arrangements, and population level variation.\\nThis pursuit of ever increasing data has lead to breakthroughs in ancestry assessments, multi-omic precision medicine models and has spurred molecular breakthroughs like the Crispr-Cas9 system of gene editing. Crispr-Cas9, most recently made infamous by the ethically condemned modification of Chinese twins (Schmitz,).\\nWhile genome sequencing is a great tool for identifying genetic variation that might be involved in disease mechanisms, correlation does not equal causality. Gene editing tools offer the population geneticists the opportunity to identify population-specific variation derived from large scale sequencing experiments and to conduct further assessment of the functional significance of genome sequence variation, thus potentially identifying the changeable sites underlying traits or disorders. For example, gene editing technologies can be used to investigate population-specific, positively selected point mutations implicated in a range of diseases (Komor et al.,). In addition to using these tools that are already in existence to functionally investigate individual variants in clonal cell lines, multiple laboratories have begun to develop new editing tools to simultaneously introduce multiple mutations in the human genome via multiplex nucleotide editing of population specific haplotypes under selection, or multiple point mutations on different chromosomes in human genome.\\nEngineering new tools to functionally investigate single nucleotide changes is an exciting prospect for two primary reasons: (A) Creating accountability. Culturally competent empirical evidence and detailed theoretical considerations should be used for evolutionary explanations of phenotypic variation observed in humans (especially Indigenous populations). Population genetics investigators frequently overlook the importance of these ethnographic criteria when associating observed trait variation with evolutionary analysis. Functional investigation of population specific variation has the potential to empower the population genetics community by holding evolutionary explanations accountable (Gould and Lewontin,). This need for mechanistic insight is framed by problematic narratives and exacerbated by correlation based studies that fail to properly functionally investigate single nucleotide changes. Because Indigenous populations are vulnerable (i.e., at risk populations), it is the genomic technology development community\\'s responsibility to take these potentially problematic narratives to task (Neel,). Not to just reclaim Indigenous history through the population genetics projects we champion, but potentially empower Indigenous history with genome editing tools. (B) Democratizing tools. Indigenous peoples are under-represented in both population-based genomic studies, and as primary investigators in academia. For Indigenous researchers, this leads to questions as to how Indigenous peoples will meaningfully participate in human population genetics, and how to address the disparities currently existing in Indigenous communities? One way that Indigenous scientists are addressing this is the formation of an educational consortium that is focused on educating Indigenous genetics, such as the Summer Internship for Indigenous Peoples in Genomics (SING Consortium). This research consortium works with Indigenous communities to generate large scale data to address the genomic and health disparity questions that those communities have Claw et al..\\nIn addition to standard metrics of academic success such as grant awards and paper publications, Indigenous researchers must transition our research focus to understanding how independent research programs will become actionable. If participating Indigenous communities are not presented with tangible benefits to collaborating with non-Indigenous scientists, such as access to medicine, developments to infrastructure, or capacity building, then research focusing on Indigenous communities could potentially continue a legacy of colonial exploitation. Technological independence, self-governance, and democratization of the tools should always be the long-term goal of ethical partnerships in genomic sample collection, large scale data analysis and inference generation. Some easy solutions to address these concerns include engaging Indigenous communities in educational seminars within Indigenous spaces including Native American Reservations, Hawaiian Heiau, and Maori Marae. Another priority must be to transition genomic research toward focusing on the development of biomedical tools to make gene editing of deleterious genomic changes more affordable, empowering Indigenous populations across the globe to gain agency over their own future.',\n",

       "    'case_text': \"A 62-year-old non-smoking woman with cough and chest tightness was initially found to have space-occupying lesions in her lungs in a physical examination at another hospital. Then she came to our hospital for further treatment. At this time, she had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1. And she had no relevant medical or surgical history. Enhanced CT showed a 3.0 x 3.0 cm mass in the left lower lung with diffuse miliary metastases in both lungs and no distant lymph node metastasis. The clinical stage was T1cN0M1a, and the pathological puncture diagnosis was lung adenocarcinoma in December 2016. She refused the gene test and received first-line treatment: pemetrexed 0.5 mg/m2 d1 + cisplatin 75 mg/m2 d1, q3w, for six cycles from January 2017 to June 2017. From July 2017 to April 2018, pemetrexed was given 0.8 d1, q3w, for nine cycles, and the best response was stable disease (SD) ( Figure 1 ). In May 2018, CT reexamination revealed multiple vertebral metastases in the spine, and the efficacy was evaluated as progressive disease (PD). Therefore, second-line treatment regimen was used: docetaxel 120 mg d1, q21d, five cycles, from May 2018 to September 2018. Then CT reexamination after the end of treatment showed that the response was PD.\\nThis time, the patient expressed a strong desire for treatment, and we had full discussions with the patient and her family to determine the next step of treatment. On October 22, 2018, we performed genetic testing on the patient using PCR, and the results showed that EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 were all wild types ( Figure 2A ). Atezolizumab treatment was initiated on November 2, 2018, based on the results of the OAK clinical trial and the guidelines. After two cycles, CT showed partial response (PR) ( Figure 3 ).\\nAt cycle 18 of atezolizumab, free triiodothyronine (FT3) decreased to 3.62 pmol/L, and the patient was treated with the addition of levothyroxine sodium tablet 50 mug qd po. Liver metastasis occurred, and lung disease progressed on October 13, 2020 ( Figure 2C ). PFS was as long as 23 months. The clinical stage at this time was T2aN0M1c. After discussion of the multidisciplinary team (MDT), pathological puncture and genetic testing were conducted again for the patient, and the results showed EGFR L858R and T790M mutations ( Figure 2B ). Research by Hsu et al. suggested that mutations in EGFR are associated with a higher rate of miliary lung metastases; for the sake of precision, we redid genetic testing on the patient's 2018 pathological specimen using a more accurate next-generation sequencing (NGS), and we found that the patient had the EGFR L858R mutation prior to the use of atezolizumab. Then the patient was treated with osimertinib in view of EGFRT790M, but the follow-up CT until March 2021 showed that the lesion continued to progress ( Figure 2D ).\\nIn order to explore why the patient responded well to atezolizumab but not to osimertinib, we performed the whole gene test (825 gene) by NGS and immunohistochemistry (IHC). At this time, the patient carried EGFR L858R, T790M, and TP53 R282W mutations; and her plasma sample had a low tumor mutational burden (TMB) of 6.45 muts/Mb. IHC showed PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) <1% (antibody was 22C3), but the expression of PD-L1 in immune cells was 5%. In addition, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were highly infiltrated ( Figure 4 ).\",\n",

Clinical examination revealed a well-defined, nontender, smooth-surfaced, roughly oval, fluctuant swelling [Figure 1]. No relevant medical history was elicited. Oral hygiene was fair. A provisional diagnosis of mucocele was made; the lesion was excised under local anesthesia. Histopathological examination of the excised tissue revealed cystic lumen devoid of lining epithelium and surrounded by compressed granulation tissue and peripherally located mixed salivary glands. The lumen was filled with numerous mucinous globular structures which were oval or round in shape and of varying sizes [Figure 2]. Most of the globules present in the cystic lumen were attached to the surrounding cystic capsule and seemed dissociated from one another because of their globular organization. Some of the globules were suspended freely within the lumen [Figure 3]. Individual globules exhibited a mildly cellular core with peripheral laminations of dystrophic calcifications [Figure 4]. The granulation tissue forming the cystic wall was highly cellular, consisting of chronic inflammatory cells. The mucinous globules showed positive results for PAS and Alcian blue [Figures 3 and 4].',\n",
