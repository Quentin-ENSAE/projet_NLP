       "      <td>For each death, the DSS has systematically recorded the age at death and the date of death (including day and month of death). A detailed VA questionnaire has been collected for deaths of children aged &lt; 15 years old since 1985, and for all deaths since 2003. VA questionnaires are usually completed by close relatives of the deceased. For adults, they include an assessment of whether the deceased was pregnant at the time of death. After review of VA data by physicians, a likely cause of death is assigned to each recorded death using ICD-9 codes. According to this database, maternal mortality is high ( 915 per 100,000 live births for 2003-06,).\\nIn August 2010, we conducted a pilot study aimed at determining the feasibility of linking retrospective survey data collected during SSH to DSS data, at the individual level. Prior studies comparing SSH and DSS data had been conducted at the aggregate level, and thus did not permit examining misclassification biases. In total, we interviewed 268 women aged 15-59 years who had at least one female sibling known to have died at reproductive ages according to the DSS datasets since the 1980s. Respondents were asked to complete the standard SSH questionnaire used during the 2005 DHS in Senegal. Interviewers were recruited among those who had participated in that DHS. Some survey respondents were members of the same sibship, and some deaths were thus potentially reported multiple times during the SSH survey.\\nWe focus here on the subset of deaths having occurred in 2003-2009 because detailed VA questionnaires for adult deaths were systematically introduced in the Bandafassi DSS in 2003, and because this period matches the \"reference period\" usually used in producing estimates of adult and maternal mortality using SSH data (Timaeus and Jasseh 2004). We identify PR deaths in the DSS data as follows: 1) we use demographic surveillance data on dates of births and deaths to identify deaths having occurred at the time of delivery or within 2 months of a delivery regardless of the actual cause; 2) we use data from the VA questionnaires (i.e., a yes/no question asking VA respondent whether the deceased was pregnant at the time of the survey) to identify deaths having occurred during pregnancy. It is important to note that, in order to classify a death as PR or non-PR according to the DSS data, we do not use the ICD-9 codes assigned by physicians to each death. In SSH data, we define PR deaths as deaths reported to have occurred either during pregnancy, delivery or within 2 months of delivery according to the respondent.\\nWe could not compare PR classifications obtained from SSH and DSS data for all deaths observed between 2003 and 2009 because, for some of the deceased, there were no eligible sisters in the DSS population or eligible sisters could not be located. In other cases, we could not ascertain whether the recorded death was PR because of missing data in the DSS dataset and/or the VA questionnaire. We thus begin by comparing the age at death, date of death, and PR classification obtained from the DSS of included vs. excluded deaths. We do so using chi2 tests of association. Among included deaths, we then examine the cross-classification of deaths as PR or non-PR, according to the SSH and DSS data. We calculate the proportion of deaths identified as PR (non-PR) in the DSS dataset, which were also classified as PR (non-PR) deaths in the SSH data. We do so for all reports collected during the SSH survey, and for a restricted sample in which we select at random one report of death per sibship (to avoid double-counting). In the case of discrepant classifications of PR deaths between SSH and DSS data, we report a) the cause of death as ascertained by physicians (using VA data), b) the time since the last recorded birth of the deceased, and c) the relationship between the deceased and the person who completed the VA questionnaire (e.g., sister-in-law). Finally, we use SSH data to investigate agreement between sisters about the reported timing of death in sibships where multiple sisters were interviewed.</td>\n",

Fever (95.3%) and cough (65.1%) were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea (16.3) was not common. 37.2% of patients had at least one underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases). There is no significant difference in median age between male and female groups, but the maximum of the range of IQR is lower in male (66 years in men vs. 73 years in women). Symptoms and comorbidities were comparable between men and women. As expected, men had a higher level of hemoglobin. However, male patients also had elevated serum creatinine, white blood cells, and neutrophils. Among the 43-case series, 13 (30.2%) were diagnosed with Mild or Moderate pneumonia, while 14 (32.6%) and 16 (37.2%) were diagnosed with Severe and Critical pneumonia, respectively. Chi-square (chi2) test for trend indicated that men's cases of COVID-19 tended to be more serious than women's (P = 0.035), according to the clinical classification of severity (Figure 1).\\nBetween March 25 and May 22, 2003, a total of 524 SARS patients, including 139 deaths, in the Beijing area were reported from 29 hospitals enrolled in our analysis. Fever (98.4%) and cough (76.9%) were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea (6.7%) was not common. 57.0% of the patients had at least one of the concomitant diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases. The mean duration from self-reported symptoms to death was 15 (IQR: 10-19) days. Table 2 summarizes the clinical and biochemical characteristics of all SARS patients. The median age of the deceased patients was much higher than that of the patients who survived (57 vs. 32, P &lt; 0.001). The rate of the concomitant diseases in the deceased patients was also higher than that of the patients who survived (57.0% vs. 17.9%, P &lt; 0.001). While the deceased patients were significantly older than the patients who survived (Figure 3A), ages were comparable between men and women in both patients who deceased and survived with SARS (Figure 3B). The proportion of men was higher in the deceased group (53.2%) than in the group who survived (42.3%) (chi2 test, P = 0.027) (Figure 3C). Survival analysis showed that men had a significantly higher mortality rate than women (31.2 vs. 22.6%) in this hospital-based cohort (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06], P = 0.026) (Figure 3D).</td>\n",

She had a history of leiomyoma since 5 months ago, and was hospitalized due to vaginal bleeding, and had been undergone therapy by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and medroxyprogesterone acetate, intramuscularly. To control her anemia, she was given oral ferrous sulfate. There was no relevant familial history of the same condition. On physical examination, she was anxious and tachypneic on admission, with body mass index of 24.7 kg/m2, body temperature 37 C, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, heart rate 120 beats per min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per min, and 96% oxygen saturation while breathing room air. Other findings included regular heart beat with a 2/6 systolic murmur in the left sternal border, clear lung sound, and a non-tender abdomen with a 20-week size uterus. There was no swelling in her lower limbs.\\nAn electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia and inverted T waves in v1 to v3 and inferior leads. Hematologic testing revealed hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL and other results were within normal limits. Coagulation factors were also unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed Westermark sign without pleural effusion. An ultrasound investigation revealed an acute DVT in the popliteal and superficial femoral veins of her left leg and an enlarged leiomyoma of the uterus. Thereafter, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated normal left ventricle systolic function, severe right ventricle enlargement, McConnell sign, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension of 110 mmHg, and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery. In addition, a 2.6 1.6 cm echogenic mass was detected in the left pulmonary artery, consistent with thrombosis (Figure 1). Given her leiomyoma history, she underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed a huge uterine-derived mass compressing both common iliac veins (Figure 2).\\nDue to massive PE, the patient was administered loading dose of 250 000 units of streptokinase and the infusion of 100 000 units per hour during 24 h. After undergoing thrombolysis, her general condition significantly improved, and then she underwent anticoagulation therapy. One unit of packed red blood cells was also transfused. Examination by TEE on the fourth day revealed the disappearance of the pulmonary artery thrombosis. After achieving a therapeutic range of international normalized ratio (range 2.0-3.0), she was discharged on warfarin 5 mg daily.\\nThe patient was followed for 3 months and then evaluated again and examined using TEE and ultrasonography, which demonstrated normal findings. After withholding warfarin preoperatively, she underwent myomectomy instead of hysterectomy due to her uterus preservation. Warfarin therapy commenced again following surgery, and she was discharged in stable condition on warfarin therapy. Nine months after myomectomy, she was well, without evidence of thromboembolism.</td>\n",

The tinnitus disappeared when the left carotid artery was compressed, and a bruit was heard over the left eyeball. No clear abnormal findings were detected by computed tomography (CT) of the head, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head revealed a CCF, and the patient was referred to our hospital and examined.\\nThe patient's consciousness level was clear on arrival at our hospital. Ophthalmological examination indicated corrected visual acuity of 1.0/1.0. Bilateral Amsler grid testing indicated no abnormalities at any point in either visual field. The left eye was markedly red with dilated irregular conjunctival and subconjunctival vessels. Hess chart testing indicated abducens nerve paralysis. Based on the patient's family history, past medical history, and the imaging findings, there was a strong possibility of a CCF complicating EDS, and because of the possibility that angiography would cause vascular injury, the preoperative evaluation was performed by 3D CTA.\\nElder brother: Dissection of the thoracic aorta\\nFather's family: Rupture of the abdominal aorta, sudden death\\nAlthough the symptoms temporarily improved in response to intermittent manual compression of the carotid artery, they became more severe again (Fig. 1). Because of the development of higher function disorders, including aphasia and agnosia, associated with marked cortical reflux within the cranium, endovascular treatment (TVE) was performed under general anesthesia. A direct CCF from the vicinity of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) at the C3-4 level was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA).

Laboratory tests did not detect any alterations, and gave the following results: white blood cell count was 79.000/mm3, red blood cell count 5,3.106/mm3, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, hematocrit 39.1%, platelets 19.6 x 104/microL, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 25 IU/L, alanine transaminase 19 IU/L, albumin 4.25 g/ dL, lactate dehydrogenase 240 IU/L, beta-glutamyltransferase 27 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 201 IU/L, amylase 129 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen 11.6 mg/dL, creatinine 8 mg/L, C-reactive protein 3 mg/L, urinalysis pH 7.0, no uric protein, no urinary sugar, no ketone body, no uric blood, no bilirubin, and no white blood cell, and no bacteriuria. A chest CT was done and did not show any metastasis. The presumptive diagnosis was a renal tumor classified T2a-N2-M0, associated with a multi lithiasis gallbladder.\\nTherapeutic interventions: a right open radical nephrectomy via subcostal incision with lymph node dissection and cholecystectomy was performed. The surgical exploration showed a right renal large superior polar exophytic mass with two palpable hilar lymphadenopathies. The wall of the gallbladder appeared normal except for its lithiasis content. The surgical intervention was performed successfully without adhesion or local invasion.\\nFollow-up and outcome of interventions: the postoperative course was without complications, and the patient was uneventfully discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Pathological assessment of the specimen showed the tumor was well-circumscribed, measuring 9 x 7 x 5 cm and subtotally effacing the kidney. At sectioning, it was tan-yellow with large necrotic areas. The gallbladder was thin-walled with a 0.4 x 0.3 submucosal nodule. Microscopically the renal tumor consisted of a tubulopapillar lined by pseudostratified layers of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and high nucleolar grade. It was a clear cell RCC with the pathologic stage of pT2a, Fuhrman 3. The polypoid lesion of the gallbladder was identical to those of the renal tumor population, made up of large, plant-like cells with clear cytoplasm, adopting an acinar or solid architecture within a stroma rich in small vessels (Figure 3A, Figure 3B). Immunohistochemistry was positive for cytokeratin CK7, AMACR (a-Methylacyl Coenzyme A Racemase), cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and vimentin (Figure 3C, Figure 3D). The morphologic and phenotypic profiles were consistent with synchronous metastasis from renal carcinoma. Additionally, the histopathological study found several lymph nodes to be invaded. So, the final stage of the tumor was pT2a-N2-M1. The follow-up was carried out by CT scan at six months, and then after one year, the patient did not present a recurrence, and the renal function remained normal.\\nPatient perspective: the patient was informed about the all procedure, complication and outcome, and she was agreeing about it. The patient was pleased with the care she received throughout therapy.\\nInformed consent: written informed consent was obtained from the patient for participation in our study.</td>\n",

Despite these symptoms, he did not seek medical attention elsewhere until 6 months later, when he was referred to our center for evaluation.\\nThe physical exam revealed stable vital signs with generalized skin and conjunctival pallor and examination of the rectum revealed an indurated, circumferentially fixed and partially obstructive mass located 7 cm from the anal margin.\\nA colonoscopy was performed; revealing an ulcer-budding stenotic tumor of the middle rectum located 7 cm from the anal margin. Several biopsies were taken during the procedure. The histological analysis revealed signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. Given this finding, we conducted an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy with biopsies, which uncovered no signs of malignancy.\\nThe abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an infiltrating and budding thickening of the mid-rectum measuring 70 mm in height and 16 mm in maximum thickness. The process appeared heterogeneous with hypointensity on T1, moderate hyperintensity on T2, and heterogeneous enhancement with infiltration of the rectal wall, mesorectal fat, and the right posterior rectal fascia associated with multiple mesorectal lymph nodes. The thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no evidence of metastatic lesions and the tumor was staged as T3d N2 M0. Laboratory tests showed anemia at 9 g/dl, normal levels of leukocytes and platelets, normal renal and hepatic function, and normal carcinoembrionary antigen level of 1.28 IU/L (normal range: 0-2.5 IU/L).\\nThe patient presented 1 week later with symptoms of acute intestinal obstruction, for which he underwent a diverting colostomy. Then, he was started on concurrent chemoradiotherapy, receiving a total dose of 45 Gy, divided into 30 sessions with oral xeloda-based chemotherapy. During the restaging workup, the MRI revealed a partial response. After multidisciplinary consensus, a protected anterior resection was agreed upon.\\nPeroperative findings revealed a supraumbilical subcutaneous parietal well-limited lipoma of 8 cm of greatest dimension, which was resected.\\nHe underwent an anterior resection and manual coloanal anastomosis with a temporary ileostomy. The surgical procedure was carried out uneventfully. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.\\nThe histopathological examination of the anterior resection specimen reveals an ulcerated and infiltrative tumor on the right anterolateral wall of the rectum, measuring 35*15 mm. Microscopic examination concluded that the residual tumor is classified as grade 2 according to the Dworak classification (presence of fibrous or mucinous remodeling with a few persistent cells or glands). The remnant tumor cells infiltrate the wall down to the perirectal fat with a clearance of less than 1 mm. There was no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Two metastatic lymph nodes out of 11 nodes sampled were identified.\\nThe adipose mass weighs 60 g and measures 80*65*30 mm. At cut section, poorly defined fibrous areas were identified and well-sampled. Microscopic study revealed infiltration by a mucinous adenocarcinoma with a contingent of signet ring cells (Figures 1 and 2).\\nThe disease was staged as ypT4N1M1 according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging classification. The patient was referred to the oncology department. He started adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX-6 regimen (fluorouracil + leucovorin + oxaliplatin). A body CT scan during treatment revealed disseminated disease with diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis. The patient received corticosteroid therapy and was proposed for second-line chemotherapy, but unfortunately, he passed away 12 months later.</td>\n",

The position of the left lower limb was external rotation and abduction. The patient had no sensory-motor deficits and normal pulses in both lower limbs.\\nDiagnostic assessment: X-rays of the pelvis revealed asymmetrical bilateral fracture-luxations of the hips, with right superior-posterior and left anteroinferior dislocation (Figure 1).\\nTherapeutic intervention: the patient was admitted to the outpatient department and transferred within 6 hours to the operating room. Under general anaesthesia, a closed reduction was performed within 6 hours of trauma for both hip dislocations at the same time. Simultaneously: for the right hip dislocation, the reduction maneuver was performed on a hard surface, with counter-pressure on the anterosuperior iliac spines and traction in line with the femur, with the hip and knee flexed at 90 degrees; a clicking sound is audible during reduction. For the left hip, traction was applied along the axis of the deformity, flexing the hip to 90 degrees with an external rotation, with an audible click indicating reduction. After reduction, both hips were stable over the full range of motion distal neurovascular status. Post-reduction radiographs (Figure 2) and CT scans (Figure 3) demonstrated adequate of both hips. The patient was maintained in skin traction for both hips for 6 weeks.\\nPatient's perspective: the patient received analgesics and anti-thrombotic medication during his stay.

       "      <td>The incidence rate and prevalence of COPD are both high, with an increasing trend and heavy disease burden for COPD all over the world, and chronic respiratory diseases have been the third leading cause of death, mostly due to COPD. In China, the prevalence rate of COPD can reach 8.6%, and is higher than 13% among people over 40 years old. Although the disease-associated burden decreased in the past 30 years, COPD remains a critical public health problem in China.\\nIn recent years, a series of studies have been performed and gratifying results have been obtained for COPD. Its occurrence and development have been delayed to a certain extent; however, although the constantly updated treatment measures help to improve the clinical symptoms and delay disease progression, most COPD patients are still undergoing rapid progression, especially for severe and very severe patients, and AEs are still critical events, causing decreased pulmonary function, increased hospitalizations, and worse prognoses such as death. Reducing AEs remains a key target for severe and very severe COPD patients.\\nInflammation is an important pathogenesis for COPD, and corticosteroids are an important treatment option. However, oral corticosteroids increase mortality in stable COPD patients. Therefore, inhalation corticosteroids have garnered increased attention and are widely used. beta2-agonist (LABA) and/or muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and other combinations are important treatment options for COPD. Triple therapy has also been considered to be an effective treatment for severe and very severe COPD to improve pulmonary function. However, triple therapy cannot effectively reduce AEs and mortality, and the prognosis may not improve. New treatments to improve efficacy are urgently required.\\nThrough long-term clinical practice and experience, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has proven to have good clinical efficacy and advantages in the treatment of COPD to improve symptoms, reduce AEs, and improve quality of life. However, there is a lack of uniformity on the prescription thereof, and evidence-based studies are insufficient. Consequently, we performed a series of studies of TCM for COPD.\\nThe core TCM pathogenesis is deficiency of vital energy and accumulated damage. Deficiency is the root cause, with manifestation of phlegm and blood stasis. For severe and very severe COPD, treatments should focus on strengthening the vital energy (invigorating the lungs and kidneys, supplemented by strengthening the spleen), and assist in reducing phlegm and promoting blood circulation. We, therefore, previously established TCM treatment schemes and prescriptions for different stages and grades of COPD, which were then optimized through clinical practice and basic studies. Here, we aimed to formulate a Bu-fei Yi-shen granule (BYG) for the treatment of COPD and conduct a randomized controlled trial to provide critical references for the treatment of severe and very severe COPD.</td>\n",

Although his physical examination in the emergency department revealed no significant findings, a chest radiograph displayed a consolidated area with spicular extension in the left hilar region. Subsequent thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed a mass lesion measuring 38x25x36 mm with a standard uptake value (SUV) of 7.44 adjacent to the hilar region (Figure 1). Suspecting lung malignancy, the medical team performed endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS), which identified a heterogeneous hypoechoic intramural lesion on the anterior wall of the left upper lobe entrance. Cytological samples were taken from the lesion twice, which tested negative for malignancy. However, they revealed bacterial clusters consistent with Actinomyces (Figure 2). The patient was initially treated with 4 x 2 g of intravenous ampicillin for eight weeks. A follow-up CT scan showed complete regression of the mass in the upper lobe (Figure 1). Treatment continued with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, administered orally at a dosage of 3 x 1 g for an additional eight weeks, during which he was closely monitored. Pulmonary actinomycosis is known to mimic a range of lung pathologies, from benign infections to metastatic tumors, and 25% of thoracic actinomycosis cases are initially misdiagnosed as malignancy.

Esophageal stenosis was also noted, along with multiple rounded 0.5x0.5 cm mass lesions at the proximal esophageal opening. Biopsy was taken, which was suggestive of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Post-radiotherapy laryngeal and esophageal stenosis can occur as a complication of radiation therapy aimed at treating cancers in the head and neck region. Radiation therapy, while effective in targeting cancer cells, can also affect nearby healthy tissues, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and reduced elasticity of the tissues in the throat and esophagus. Symptoms may include hoarseness, coughing, choking, difficulty swallowing, pain during swallowing, shortness of breath, and a sensation of something stuck in the throat. Treatment options may include speech therapy, dilation procedures, surgical intervention, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the severity and specific manifestations of stenosis.</td>\n",

       "1      For each death, the DSS has systematically recorded the age at death and the date of death (including day and month of death). A detailed VA questionnaire has been collected for deaths of children aged < 15 years old since 1985, and for all deaths since 2003. VA questionnaires are usually completed by close relatives of the deceased. For adults, they include an assessment of whether the deceased was pregnant at the time of death. After review of VA data by physicians, a likely cause of death is assigned to each recorded death using ICD-9 codes. According to this database, maternal mortality is high ( 915 per 100,000 live births for 2003-06,).\\nIn August 2010, we conducted a pilot study aimed at determining the feasibility of linking retrospective survey data collected during SSH to DSS data, at the individual level. Prior studies comparing SSH and DSS data had been conducted at the aggregate level, and thus did not permit examining misclassification biases. In total, we interviewed 268 women aged 15-59 years who had at least one female sibling known to have died at reproductive ages according to the DSS datasets since the 1980s. Respondents were asked to complete the standard SSH questionnaire used during the 2005 DHS in Senegal. Interviewers were recruited among those who had participated in that DHS. Some survey respondents were members of the same sibship, and some deaths were thus potentially reported multiple times during the SSH survey.\\nWe focus here on the subset of deaths having occurred in 2003-2009 because detailed VA questionnaires for adult deaths were systematically introduced in the Bandafassi DSS in 2003, and because this period matches the \"reference period\" usually used in producing estimates of adult and maternal mortality using SSH data (Timaeus and Jasseh 2004). We identify PR deaths in the DSS data as follows: 1) we use demographic surveillance data on dates of births and deaths to identify deaths having occurred at the time of delivery or within 2 months of a delivery regardless of the actual cause; 2) we use data from the VA questionnaires (i.e., a yes/no question asking VA respondent whether the deceased was pregnant at the time of the survey) to identify deaths having occurred during pregnancy. It is important to note that, in order to classify a death as PR or non-PR according to the DSS data, we do not use the ICD-9 codes assigned by physicians to each death. In SSH data, we define PR deaths as deaths reported to have occurred either during pregnancy, delivery or within 2 months of delivery according to the respondent.\\nWe could not compare PR classifications obtained from SSH and DSS data for all deaths observed between 2003 and 2009 because, for some of the deceased, there were no eligible sisters in the DSS population or eligible sisters could not be located. In other cases, we could not ascertain whether the recorded death was PR because of missing data in the DSS dataset and/or the VA questionnaire. We thus begin by comparing the age at death, date of death, and PR classification obtained from the DSS of included vs. excluded deaths. We do so using chi2 tests of association. Among included deaths, we then examine the cross-classification of deaths as PR or non-PR, according to the SSH and DSS data. We calculate the proportion of deaths identified as PR (non-PR) in the DSS dataset, which were also classified as PR (non-PR) deaths in the SSH data. We do so for all reports collected during the SSH survey, and for a restricted sample in which we select at random one report of death per sibship (to avoid double-counting). In the case of discrepant classifications of PR deaths between SSH and DSS data, we report a) the cause of death as ascertained by physicians (using VA data), b) the time since the last recorded birth of the deceased, and c) the relationship between the deceased and the person who completed the VA questionnaire (e.g., sister-in-law). Finally, we use SSH data to investigate agreement between sisters about the reported timing of death in sibships where multiple sisters were interviewed.   \n",

The median age was 62 years (IQR, 51 to 70). Fever (95.3%) and cough (65.1%) were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea (16.3) was not common. 37.2% of patients had at least one underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases). There is no significant difference in median age between male and female groups, but the maximum of the range of IQR is lower in male (66 years in men vs. 73 years in women). Symptoms and comorbidities were comparable between men and women. As expected, men had a higher level of hemoglobin. However, male patients also had elevated serum creatinine, white blood cells, and neutrophils. Among the 43-case series, 13 (30.2%) were diagnosed with Mild or Moderate pneumonia, while 14 (32.6%) and 16 (37.2%) were diagnosed with Severe and Critical pneumonia, respectively. Chi-square (chi2) test for trend indicated that men's cases of COVID-19 tended to be more serious than women's (P = 0.035), according to the clinical classification of severity (Figure 1).\\nBetween March 25 and May 22, 2003, a total of 524 SARS patients, including 139 deaths, in the Beijing area were reported from 29 hospitals enrolled in our analysis. Fever (98.4%) and cough (76.9%) were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea (6.7%) was not common. 57.0% of the patients had at least one of the concomitant diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases. The mean duration from self-reported symptoms to death was 15 (IQR: 10-19) days. Table 2 summarizes the clinical and biochemical characteristics of all SARS patients. The median age of the deceased patients was much higher than that of the patients who survived (57 vs. 32, P < 0.001). The rate of the concomitant diseases in the deceased patients was also higher than that of the patients who survived (57.0% vs. 17.9%, P < 0.001). While the deceased patients were significantly older than the patients who survived (Figure 3A), ages were comparable between men and women in both patients who deceased and survived with SARS (Figure 3B). The proportion of men was higher in the deceased group (53.2%) than in the group who survived (42.3%) (chi2 test, P = 0.027) (Figure 3C). Survival analysis showed that men had a significantly higher mortality rate than women (31.2 vs. 22.6%) in this hospital-based cohort (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06], P = 0.026) (Figure 3D).   \n",

She had a history of leiomyoma since 5 months ago, and was hospitalized due to vaginal bleeding, and had been undergone therapy by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and medroxyprogesterone acetate, intramuscularly. To control her anemia, she was given oral ferrous sulfate. There was no relevant familial history of the same condition. On physical examination, she was anxious and tachypneic on admission, with body mass index of 24.7 kg/m2, body temperature 37 C, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, heart rate 120 beats per min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per min, and 96% oxygen saturation while breathing room air. Other findings included regular heart beat with a 2/6 systolic murmur in the left sternal border, clear lung sound, and a non-tender abdomen with a 20-week size uterus. There was no swelling in her lower limbs.\\nAn electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia and inverted T waves in v1 to v3 and inferior leads. Hematologic testing revealed hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL and other results were within normal limits. Coagulation factors were also unremarkable. A chest radiograph showed Westermark sign without pleural effusion. An ultrasound investigation revealed an acute DVT in the popliteal and superficial femoral veins of her left leg and an enlarged leiomyoma of the uterus. Thereafter, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated normal left ventricle systolic function, severe right ventricle enlargement, McConnell sign, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension of 110 mmHg, and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery. In addition, a 2.6 1.6 cm echogenic mass was detected in the left pulmonary artery, consistent with thrombosis (Figure 1). Given her leiomyoma history, she underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed a huge uterine-derived mass compressing both common iliac veins (Figure 2).\\nDue to massive PE, the patient was administered loading dose of 250 000 units of streptokinase and the infusion of 100 000 units per hour during 24 h. After undergoing thrombolysis, her general condition significantly improved, and then she underwent anticoagulation therapy. One unit of packed red blood cells was also transfused. Examination by TEE on the fourth day revealed the disappearance of the pulmonary artery thrombosis. After achieving a therapeutic range of international normalized ratio (range 2.0-3.0), she was discharged on warfarin 5 mg daily.\\nThe patient was followed for 3 months and then evaluated again and examined using TEE and ultrasonography, which demonstrated normal findings. After withholding warfarin preoperatively, she underwent myomectomy instead of hysterectomy due to her uterus preservation. Warfarin therapy commenced again following surgery, and she was discharged in stable condition on warfarin therapy. Nine months after myomectomy, she was well, without evidence of thromboembolism.   \n",

The tinnitus disappeared when the left carotid artery was compressed, and a bruit was heard over the left eyeball. No clear abnormal findings were detected by computed tomography (CT) of the head, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head revealed a CCF, and the patient was referred to our hospital and examined.\\nThe patient's consciousness level was clear on arrival at our hospital. Ophthalmological examination indicated corrected visual acuity of 1.0/1.0. Bilateral Amsler grid testing indicated no abnormalities at any point in either visual field. The left eye was markedly red with dilated irregular conjunctival and subconjunctival vessels. Hess chart testing indicated abducens nerve paralysis. Based on the patient's family history, past medical history, and the imaging findings, there was a strong possibility of a CCF complicating EDS, and because of the possibility that angiography would cause vascular injury, the preoperative evaluation was performed by 3D CTA.\\nElder brother: Dissection of the thoracic aorta\\nFather's family: Rupture of the abdominal aorta, sudden death\\nAlthough the symptoms temporarily improved in response to intermittent manual compression of the carotid artery, they became more severe again (Fig. 1). Because of the development of higher function disorders, including aphasia and agnosia, associated with marked cortical reflux within the cranium, endovascular treatment (TVE) was performed under general anesthesia. A direct CCF from the vicinity of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) at the C3-4 level was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Marked retrograde flow into the intracranial veins was observed, and treatment was performed as described below (Fig. 2).   \n",

The patient mentioned a history of weight loss, decreased appetite, and generalized weakness. There was no significant medical or family history or any relevant past interventions.\\nClinical findings: the physical examination was unremarkable. The temperature was 37.3 C, blood pressure 124/84 mmHg, and pulse rate regular at 86 beats/min. In palpation, we revealed mild tenderness in the right flank but without any palpable mass.\\nDiagnostic assessment: abdominal computer tomography (CT) scan revealed a heterogeneous right renal mass measuring 86 x76x 68 mm and arising from the upper and middle pole (Figure 1), with a lymph node of 8 mm diameter detected in the renal hilum as well as a multi lithiasis gallbladder (Figure 2). Laboratory tests did not detect any alterations, and gave the following results: white blood cell count was 79.000/mm3, red blood cell count 5,3.106/mm3, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, hematocrit 39.1%, platelets 19.6 x 104/microL, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 25 IU/L, alanine transaminase 19 IU/L, albumin 4.25 g/ dL, lactate dehydrogenase 240 IU/L, beta-glutamyltransferase 27 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 201 IU/L, amylase 129 IU/L, blood urea nitrogen 11.6 mg/dL, creatinine 8 mg/L, C-reactive protein 3 mg/L, urinalysis pH 7.0, no uric protein, no urinary sugar, no ketone body, no uric blood, no bilirubin, and no white blood cell, and no bacteriuria. A chest CT was done and did not show any metastasis. The presumptive diagnosis was a renal tumor classified T2a-N2-M0, associated with a multi lithiasis gallbladder.\\nTherapeutic interventions: a right open radical nephrectomy via subcostal incision with lymph node dissection and cholecystectomy was performed. The surgical exploration showed a right renal large superior polar exophytic mass with two palpable hilar lymphadenopathies. The wall of the gallbladder appeared normal except for its lithiasis content. The surgical intervention was performed successfully without adhesion or local invasion.\\nFollow-up and outcome of interventions: the postoperative course was without complications, and the patient was uneventfully discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Pathological assessment of the specimen showed the tumor was well-circumscribed, measuring 9 x 7 x 5 cm and subtotally effacing the kidney. At sectioning, it was tan-yellow with large necrotic areas. The gallbladder was thin-walled with a 0.4 x 0.3 submucosal nodule. Microscopically the renal tumor consisted of a tubulopapillar lined by pseudostratified layers of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and high nucleolar grade. It was a clear cell RCC with the pathologic stage of pT2a, Fuhrman 3. The polypoid lesion of the gallbladder was identical to those of the renal tumor population, made up of large, plant-like cells with clear cytoplasm, adopting an acinar or solid architecture within a stroma rich in small vessels (Figure 3A, Figure 3B). Immunohistochemistry was positive for cytokeratin CK7, AMACR (a-Methylacyl Coenzyme A Racemase), cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and vimentin (Figure 3C, Figure 3D). The morphologic and phenotypic profiles were consistent with synchronous metastasis from renal carcinoma. Additionally, the histopathological study found several lymph nodes to be invaded. So, the final stage of the tumor was pT2a-N2-M1. The follow-up was carried out by CT scan at six months, and then after one year, the patient did not present a recurrence, and the renal function remained normal.\\nPatient perspective: the patient was informed about the all procedure, complication and outcome, and she was agreeing about it. The patient was pleased with the care she received throughout therapy.\\nInformed consent: written informed consent was obtained from the patient for participation in our study.   \n",

Despite these symptoms, he did not seek medical attention elsewhere until 6 months later, when he was referred to our center for evaluation.\\nThe physical exam revealed stable vital signs with generalized skin and conjunctival pallor and examination of the rectum revealed an indurated, circumferentially fixed and partially obstructive mass located 7 cm from the anal margin.\\nA colonoscopy was performed; revealing an ulcer-budding stenotic tumor of the middle rectum located 7 cm from the anal margin. Several biopsies were taken during the procedure. The histological analysis revealed signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. Given this finding, we conducted an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy with biopsies, which uncovered no signs of malignancy.\\nThe abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an infiltrating and budding thickening of the mid-rectum measuring 70 mm in height and 16 mm in maximum thickness. The process appeared heterogeneous with hypointensity on T1, moderate hyperintensity on T2, and heterogeneous enhancement with infiltration of the rectal wall, mesorectal fat, and the right posterior rectal fascia associated with multiple mesorectal lymph nodes. The thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no evidence of metastatic lesions and the tumor was staged as T3d N2 M0. Laboratory tests showed anemia at 9 g/dl, normal levels of leukocytes and platelets, normal renal and hepatic function, and normal carcinoembrionary antigen level of 1.28 IU/L (normal range: 0-2.5 IU/L).\\nThe patient presented 1 week later with symptoms of acute intestinal obstruction, for which he underwent a diverting colostomy. Then, he was started on concurrent chemoradiotherapy, receiving a total dose of 45 Gy, divided into 30 sessions with oral xeloda-based chemotherapy. During the restaging workup, the MRI revealed a partial response. After multidisciplinary consensus, a protected anterior resection was agreed upon.\\nPeroperative findings revealed a supraumbilical subcutaneous parietal well-limited lipoma of 8 cm of greatest dimension, which was resected.\\nHe underwent an anterior resection and manual coloanal anastomosis with a temporary ileostomy. The surgical procedure was carried out uneventfully. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.\\nThe histopathological examination of the anterior resection specimen reveals an ulcerated and infiltrative tumor on the right anterolateral wall of the rectum, measuring 35*15 mm. Microscopic examination concluded that the residual tumor is classified as grade 2 according to the Dworak classification (presence of fibrous or mucinous remodeling with a few persistent cells or glands). The remnant tumor cells infiltrate the wall down to the perirectal fat with a clearance of less than 1 mm. There was no evidence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Two metastatic lymph nodes out of 11 nodes sampled were identified.\\nThe adipose mass weighs 60 g and measures 80*65*30 mm. At cut section, poorly defined fibrous areas were identified and well-sampled. Microscopic study revealed infiltration by a mucinous adenocarcinoma with a contingent of signet ring cells (Figures 1 and 2).\\nThe disease was staged as ypT4N1M1 according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging classification. The patient was referred to the oncology department. He started adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX-6 regimen (fluorouracil + leucovorin + oxaliplatin). A body CT scan during treatment revealed disseminated disease with diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis. The patient received corticosteroid therapy and was proposed for second-line chemotherapy, but unfortunately, he passed away 12 months later.   \n",

The primary investigation ruled out circulatory, respiratory and neurological problems. The position of the right lower limb was adducted and internally rotated. The position of the left lower limb was external rotation and abduction. The patient had no sensory-motor deficits and normal pulses in both lower limbs.\\nDiagnostic assessment: X-rays of the pelvis revealed asymmetrical bilateral fracture-luxations of the hips, with right superior-posterior and left anteroinferior dislocation (Figure 1).\\nTherapeutic intervention: the patient was admitted to the outpatient department and transferred within 6 hours to the operating room. Under general anaesthesia, a closed reduction was performed within 6 hours of trauma for both hip dislocations at the same time. Simultaneously: for the right hip dislocation, the reduction maneuver was performed on a hard surface, with counter-pressure on the anterosuperior iliac spines and traction in line with the femur, with the hip and knee flexed at 90 degrees; a clicking sound is audible during reduction. For the left hip, traction was applied along the axis of the deformity, flexing the hip to 90 degrees with an external rotation, with an audible click indicating reduction. After reduction, both hips were stable over the full range of motion distal neurovascular status. Post-reduction radiographs (Figure 2) and CT scans (Figure 3) demonstrated adequate of both hips.

In China, the prevalence rate of COPD can reach 8.6%, and is higher than 13% among people over 40 years old. Although the disease-associated burden decreased in the past 30 years, COPD remains a critical public health problem in China.\\nIn recent years, a series of studies have been performed and gratifying results have been obtained for COPD. Its occurrence and development have been delayed to a certain extent; however, although the constantly updated treatment measures help to improve the clinical symptoms and delay disease progression, most COPD patients are still undergoing rapid progression, especially for severe and very severe patients, and AEs are still critical events, causing decreased pulmonary function, increased hospitalizations, and worse prognoses such as death. Reducing AEs remains a key target for severe and very severe COPD patients.\\nInflammation is an important pathogenesis for COPD, and corticosteroids are an important treatment option. However, oral corticosteroids increase mortality in stable COPD patients. Therefore, inhalation corticosteroids have garnered increased attention and are widely used. beta2-agonist (LABA) and/or muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and other combinations are important treatment options for COPD. Triple therapy has also been considered to be an effective treatment for severe and very severe COPD to improve pulmonary function. However, triple therapy cannot effectively reduce AEs and mortality, and the prognosis may not improve. New treatments to improve efficacy are urgently required.\\nThrough long-term clinical practice and experience, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has proven to have good clinical efficacy and advantages in the treatment of COPD to improve symptoms, reduce AEs, and improve quality of life. However, there is a lack of uniformity on the prescription thereof, and evidence-based studies are insufficient. Consequently, we performed a series of studies of TCM for COPD.\\nThe core TCM pathogenesis is deficiency of vital energy and accumulated damage. Deficiency is the root cause, with manifestation of phlegm and blood stasis. For severe and very severe COPD, treatments should focus on strengthening the vital energy (invigorating the lungs and kidneys, supplemented by strengthening the spleen), and assist in reducing phlegm and promoting blood circulation. We, therefore, previously established TCM treatment schemes and prescriptions for different stages and grades of COPD, which were then optimized through clinical practice and basic studies. Here, we aimed to formulate a Bu-fei Yi-shen granule (BYG) for the treatment of COPD and conduct a randomized controlled trial to provide critical references for the treatment of severe and very severe COPD.   \n",

Although his physical examination in the emergency department revealed no significant findings, a chest radiograph displayed a consolidated area with spicular extension in the left hilar region. Subsequent thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed a mass lesion measuring 38x25x36 mm with a standard uptake value (SUV) of 7.44 adjacent to the hilar region (Figure 1). Suspecting lung malignancy, the medical team performed endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS), which identified a heterogeneous hypoechoic intramural lesion on the anterior wall of the left upper lobe entrance. Cytological samples were taken from the lesion twice, which tested negative for malignancy. However, they revealed bacterial clusters consistent with Actinomyces (Figure 2). The patient was initially treated with 4 x 2 g of intravenous ampicillin for eight weeks. A follow-up CT scan showed complete regression of the mass in the upper lobe (Figure 1). Treatment continued with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, administered orally at a dosage of 3 x 1 g for an additional eight weeks, during which he was closely monitored. Pulmonary actinomycosis is known to mimic a range of lung pathologies, from benign infections to metastatic tumors, and 25% of thoracic actinomycosis cases are initially misdiagnosed as malignancy. The patient achieved complete recovery with appropriate treatment over a sufficient duration.   \n",

The patient gave a history of carcinoma of the tongue for which she was operated and had received radiotherapy 2 years back. The patient was admitted for further evaluation and fibre optic flexible bronchoscopy showed significant laryngeal stenosis and the bronchoscope could not be negotiated further through the vocal cords. Esophageal stenosis was also noted, along with multiple rounded 0.5x0.5 cm mass lesions at the proximal esophageal opening. Biopsy was taken, which was suggestive of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Post-radiotherapy laryngeal and esophageal stenosis can occur as a complication of radiation therapy aimed at treating cancers in the head and neck region. Radiation therapy, while effective in targeting cancer cells, can also affect nearby healthy tissues, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and reduced elasticity of the tissues in the throat and esophagus. Symptoms may include hoarseness, coughing, choking, difficulty swallowing, pain during swallowing, shortness of breath, and a sensation of something stuck in the throat. Treatment options may include speech therapy, dilation procedures, surgical intervention, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the severity and specific manifestations of stenosis.   \n",
